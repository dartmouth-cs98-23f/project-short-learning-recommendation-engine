  "introduction": "This video provides an introduction to graphs as a nonlinear aggregation of nodes and edges. It discusses the two types of graphs, undirected and directed, with examples of each. The video also explains how to represent graphs using adjacency matrices and adjacency lists, along with their pros and cons in terms of time and space complexity.",
