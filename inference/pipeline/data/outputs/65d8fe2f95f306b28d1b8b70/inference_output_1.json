  "introduction": "This video provides proven strategies for acing system design interviews. The goal is to demonstrate technical expertise, approach, and the ability to build complex systems at scale. Practice, understanding of design patterns, and proficiency with visual tools are essential. The video covers a 4-step approach to system design interviews, including understanding use cases, scalability requirements, technical constraints, and constructing the design.",
