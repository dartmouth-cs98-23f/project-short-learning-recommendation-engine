  "introduction": "This video discusses parallel computing, a method of performing multiple calculations simultaneously using multiple processors. It explains the traditional computing approach and its limitations, such as the frequency limit and heat generated by electrons moving through the processor. The video introduces parallel computing as a solution to increase processing speed by dividing tasks between multiple processors. It also covers distributed computing and the use of cores in modern computers.",
