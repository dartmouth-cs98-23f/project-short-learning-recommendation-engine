  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of parallel computing, a technique used to increase the speed of computations by dividing tasks among multiple processors or cores. The video explains the traditional computing approach, the limitations of increasing the frequency of a single processor due to heat, and the introduction of parallel computing as a solution. It also discusses the differences between parallel and distributed computing.",
