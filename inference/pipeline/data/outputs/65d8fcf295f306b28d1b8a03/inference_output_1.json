  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of parallel computing, a computing approach that divides tasks between two or more processors to increase speed. It discusses the limitations of traditional computing, the advantages of parallel computing, and the challenges it presents, such as increased latency and difficulty in programming for parallel systems. The video also touches on distributed computing, which is the subject of another video.",
