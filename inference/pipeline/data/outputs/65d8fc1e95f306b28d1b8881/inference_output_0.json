  "introduction": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human natural languages. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of human languages in a manner that is valuable. This video will explain how NLP works and its importance in daily life. It will also discuss the challenges and techniques involved in NLP, including speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.",
