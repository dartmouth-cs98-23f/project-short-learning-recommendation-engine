  "introduction": "Welcome to Architecture: All Access CPU Architecture Part One. This video series delves into the intricacies of computer architecture, focusing on the central processing unit (CPU) and its role in modern computing. The series covers the history of CPU design, the binary system, computing abstraction layers, and instruction set architectures (ISAs). In this first part, we explore the birth of digital computing, the four-step instruction cycle, and the evolution of ISAs.",
