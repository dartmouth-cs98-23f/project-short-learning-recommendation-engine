  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of computer graphics, their development, and impact on various media. Computer graphics are pictures and films created using computers, often with specialized hardware and software. Topics covered include user interface design, 3D modeling, shaders, GPU design, implicit surface visualization, ray tracing, and computer vision. The methodology relies heavily on geometry, optics, and physics. Computer graphics are responsible for displaying art and image data effectively and meaningfully to the consumer and are used in animation, advertising, video games, graphic design, and more. The development of computer graphics has had a significant impact on many types of media and has revolutionized animation, movies, advertising, video games, and graphic design in general.",
