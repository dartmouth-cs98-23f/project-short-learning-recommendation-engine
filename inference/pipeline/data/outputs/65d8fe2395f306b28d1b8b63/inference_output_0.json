  "introduction": "In this video, we explore the first part of the database system architecture, focusing on the storage manager and disk storage. We discuss the various data structures, such as data files, data dictionaries, indices, and statistical data, and their roles in efficient data retrieval and management. The video also introduces the four components of the storage manager: the authorization and integrity manager, transaction manager, file manager, and buffer manager. The presentation covers the basics of database systems and management, providing an informative overview of the topic for viewers.",
