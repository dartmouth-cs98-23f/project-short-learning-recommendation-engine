  "introduction": "This video introduces neural networks, a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain and consist of interconnected layers of neurons that process and transmit information. The video discusses the concept of activations and weights, how they determine the output of a neuron, and how the connections between layers are represented. It also explains the role of the sigmoid function in early networks and the use of rectified linear units (ReLU) in modern networks.",
