  "introduction": "This chapter of the digital design and computer architecture course covers micro architecture, the implementation of hardware blocks to build a microprocessor. The chapter explores three different micro architectures: single cycle, multicycle, and pipeline processors. Performance analysis is discussed, using program execution time as the ultimate measure of speed. The architectural state of the processor is also introduced, determining what the processor is doing based on the contents of the 32 registers, program counter, and memory. Topics covered in the chapter include arithmetic logic units, multiplexers, instruction memory, data memory, and controller.",
