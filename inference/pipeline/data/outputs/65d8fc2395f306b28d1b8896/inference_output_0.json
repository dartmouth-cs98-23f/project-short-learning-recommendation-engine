  "introduction": "This chapter in the digital design and computer architecture course covers micro architecture, focusing on building hardware blocks to create a microprocessor capable of running machine language instructions. Key concepts discussed include performance analysis, different micro architectures (single cycle, multicycle, pipeline), and the architectural state that determines a processor's functionality. The chapter emphasizes the trade-offs between speed, cost, and power consumption in microprocessor design.",
