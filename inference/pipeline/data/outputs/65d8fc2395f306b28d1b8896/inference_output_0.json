  "introduction": "In this chapter, we will explore the topic of micro architecture, connecting the concepts of logic design and computer architecture. We will discuss performance analysis, different micro architectures, and advanced micro architecture techniques. The chapter will cover the implementation of a risk 5 processor, focusing on the data path and controller, architectural state, and instruction execution. The video will provide an overview of various risk 5 instructions, such as rtype instructions, memory instructions, and branch instructions, and demonstrate how to build a processor that handles these instructions.",
