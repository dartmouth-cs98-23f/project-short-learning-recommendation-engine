  "introduction": "This chapter covers the connection between software and computer architecture, specifically focusing on micro architecture. The course begins with zero and one and moves up to logic design before diving into software and computer architecture. Now, we will explore how to build a microprocessor by putting together hardware blocks that can run machine language instructions. Performance analysis is a key aspect, and we will look at three different micro architectures: single-cycle, multicycle, and pipeline processors. The chapter concludes with a discussion on advanced micro architecture techniques used in current processors.",
