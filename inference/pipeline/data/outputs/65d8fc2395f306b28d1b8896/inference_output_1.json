  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of micro architecture in digital design and computer architecture. It covers the concept of building a microprocessor by connecting hardware blocks to run machine language instructions. The chapter discusses performance analysis and three different micro architectures: single cycle, multicycle, and pipeline processors. It also explores advanced micro architecture techniques used in current processors.",
