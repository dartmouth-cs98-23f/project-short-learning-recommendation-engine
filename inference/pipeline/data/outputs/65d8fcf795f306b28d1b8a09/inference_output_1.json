  "introduction": "In this video, the difference between CISC and RISC instruction sets is explained. CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing) and RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) are two different approaches to designing computer instruction sets. CISC uses more complex instructions with multiple operations, while RISC uses simpler instructions with fewer operations. The video covers various aspects of these instruction sets, including instruction format, addressing modes, and microprogrammed control units. It also discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each approach and their impact on hardware and software design.",
