  "introduction": "This video introduces the concept of Multi Cycle Design, an approach to data path design that aims to improve performance and resource utilization. The design is based on analyzing the delays involved in the flow of information along the data path for R-class instructions and addressing the imbalance in the frequency of occurrence of certain types of instructions in a program.",
