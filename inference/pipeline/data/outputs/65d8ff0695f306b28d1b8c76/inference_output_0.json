  "introduction": "This video discusses the development of quantum computers using flipflop qubits, a new approach to building silicon quantum computers. The team at Unsw has already established a record of performance for single qubits using cubital individual atoms of phosphorous implanted in a silicon chip. The video covers the concept of quantum information encoding in the combined state of the electron and the nucleus, the operation of flipflop qubits, and the design of a large-scale quantum computer. The discussion highlights the advantages of this new method, including easier integration with normal electronic circuits and the ability to manufacture large arrays of qubits without pushing the limits of fabrication of conventional electronic devices.",
