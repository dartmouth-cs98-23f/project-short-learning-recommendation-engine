  "introduction": "This video discusses compositionality in programming languages, specifically focusing on two different kinds: subterms and parameters. The speaker introduces a model for parameters and state that captures the idea that parameters should not be functions of state. The video also covers the concept of coproduct completion and its role in initial algebra for constructing quantum circuits. The speaker mentions the use of meta operations and the reversibility of building circuits in quantum computing.",
