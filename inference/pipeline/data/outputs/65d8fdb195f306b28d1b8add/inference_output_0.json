  "introduction": "Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is the psychology of interaction between humans and computers. It is a subfield of computer science and involves understanding the psychology of the user, studying the interaction between humans and computers, and affecting the psychology of someone using a device. HCI encompasses various aspects such as graphic design, industrial design, sound, and aesthetics. This video provides an overview of HCI and its importance in software design. It also discusses the evolution of HCI from the 1980s to present day and highlights resources for studying HCI, including colleges and universities, free courses, and books.",
