  "introduction": "This video introduces Natural Language Processing (NLP), a branch of artificial intelligence that allows machines to understand, read, and derive meaning from human languages. NLP combines the fields of linguistics and computer science to create models that can comprehend language structure and guidelines. The video discusses the everyday use of NLP in seemingly normal situations, such as autocorrect and plagiarism checks. It also explains the basic process of NLP, including segmentation, tokenization, stemming, limitization stemming, part-of-speech tagging, named entity tagging, and the use of machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes to teach the model human sentiment and speech.",
