  "introduction": "Data Science involves extracting knowledge and insights from noisy data and turning them into actions that businesses can take. The field is a intersection of computer science, mathematics, and business expertise. Data science initiatives require collaboration across all three areas. The data science life cycle includes business understanding, data mining, data cleaning, exploration, advanced analytics, visualization, and collaboration between different roles. The video covers different types of data science, such as diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, and the roles involved in the data science life cycle, including business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and data engineering folks.",
