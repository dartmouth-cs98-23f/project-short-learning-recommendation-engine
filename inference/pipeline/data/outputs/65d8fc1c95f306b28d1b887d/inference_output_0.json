  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of the difference between artificial neural networks (ANNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). ANNs are simple variants of neural networks that process information in one direction, while CNNs and RNNs are more complex models that can handle image and sequence data, respectively.",

        "ANNs are a group of perceptrons or neurons that process information in one direction, making them one of the simplest variants of neural networks.",
        "ANNs can store information on the entire network and work with incomplete knowledge, but they have huge hardware dependency and sometimes have unexplained behavior.",
        "ANNs may or may not have hidden node layers, making their functioning more interpretable.",
