  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of artificial intelligence, computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning, and how they overlap. The video explains that AI is the definition of agents that receive input and act upon it, computer vision is the field that deals with making machines see, and machine learning is the idea of training systems automatically. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses vast amounts of data to automate the training process. The video highlights the intersection of these fields in video analytics, which is the field that deals with the intersection of AI, computer vision, and machine learning.",
