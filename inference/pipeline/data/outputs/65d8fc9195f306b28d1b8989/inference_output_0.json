  "introduction": "This video discusses the relationship between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science (DS) in enterprise use cases. AI refers to a computer's ability to understand, learn, and make decisions based on data, while DS is the study of large data sets and analytics methods, including machine learning, pattern discovery, and data processing. DS can be used to gain business intelligence and improve specific business processes, while AI is limited to specific, heaps of data on very specific topics. The video provides insights into the differences between AI and DS, their applications in business, and their impact on various industries.",
