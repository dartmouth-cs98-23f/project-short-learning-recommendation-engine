  "introduction": "This video discusses algorithmic game theory, a field that focuses on research at the intersection of computer science, game theory, and economic theory. The speaker discusses three different lines of work in this area: government repacking of TV stations, efficient auction design, and computational mechanism analysis. The presentation also touches on the application of economic theory to development problems, specifically in building a cell phone-based mobile market for agricultural commodities in Uganda.",
