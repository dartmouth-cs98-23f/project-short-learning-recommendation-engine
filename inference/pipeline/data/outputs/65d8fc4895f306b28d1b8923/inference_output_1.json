  "introduction": "In this talk, the speaker discusses algorithmic game theory, a field that focuses on research at the intersection of computer science, game theory, and economic theory, particularly motivated by the internet. The speaker covers three different lines of work: government-regulated auctions, computational mechanism analysis, and a sabbatical project in Uganda for building a cell phone-based mobile market for agricultural commodities. The talk aims to provide a high-level overview of these topics and their importance in the field of algorithmic game theory.",
