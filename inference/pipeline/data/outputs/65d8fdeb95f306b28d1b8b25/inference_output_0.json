  "introduction": "In this video, we will discuss the five different types of software testing that every software developer should be familiar with. These testing levels form a pyramid, with unit tests at the base and manual tests at the top. We will explore each level in detail, discussing their importance, the tests to write, and the topics covered.",

        "Unit tests are the foundation of any testing pyramid. They test individual functions and methods in your code to ensure they work correctly.",
        "The number of unit tests you need depends on your testing strategy. You should aim to test every line of code in your methods.",
        "MCDC coverage requires at least eight different unit tests to cover all scenarios in an if statement with three different conditions.",

        "It's essential to have the majority of your tests automated to avoid the vicious cycle of not having enough time to test your application before each release.",
