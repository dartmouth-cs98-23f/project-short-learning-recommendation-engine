  "introduction": "In this video, we will discuss the five types of software testing that every software developer should be aware of. The testing pyramid is a concept that suggests the majority of testing should be done at the bottom level, with the number of tests depending on the testing strategy. The video covers unit tests, component tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and manual tests.",
