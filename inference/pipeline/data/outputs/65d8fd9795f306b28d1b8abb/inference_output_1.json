  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of different user interfaces, their components, and how they interact with users. The two main components of a user interface are the presentation language and the action language. Natural language interfaces, question and answer interfaces, form fill interfaces, and graphical user interfaces are discussed, along with their advantages and limitations.",
