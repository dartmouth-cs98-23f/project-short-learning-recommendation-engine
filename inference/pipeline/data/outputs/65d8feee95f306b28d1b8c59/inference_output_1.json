  "introduction": "This computer science video discusses the concept of defence in depth, a strategy used in computer security to prevent attacks. It covers the basics of cryptography, including symmetric encryption, key exchange, and asymmetric encryption. The video also explains the use of one-way functions and the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption. The video concludes by emphasizing the importance of cryptography in secure communication on the internet.",
