  "introduction": "This video focuses on the human side of technology and the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). It explores how new devices and technologies impact our perception and behavior, and how we can create more natural, intuitive, and empowering interactions with technology. The video also discusses the use of devices to make sense of our increasingly complex work lives and interactions with others.",
