  "introduction": "Rationality as a theory of human-computer interaction (HCI) is a theoretical framework that models the adaptive behavior of users in interactive tasks. It builds on advances in machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning, which has shown success in solving complex HCI tasks. The theory assumes that the user faces a decision problem that is stochastic and sequential, and it uses decision-theoretic formalisms like POMDP to optimize policies. The goal of computational rationality in HCI is to inform the design of better user interfaces by predicting how users might adapt to changes caused by a design or an intervention.",
