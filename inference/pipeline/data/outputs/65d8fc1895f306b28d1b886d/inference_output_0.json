  "introduction": "In this video, we'll explore the concept of graphs as a nonlinear data structure. Graphs are used in various scenarios in computer science to model and represent systems. We'll first study graph as a mathematical or logical model and then discuss its implementation details. We'll also cover different types of graphs, such as directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted graphs, and their applications in various fields.",
