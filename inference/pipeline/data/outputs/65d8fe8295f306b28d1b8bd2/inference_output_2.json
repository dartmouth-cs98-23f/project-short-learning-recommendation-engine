  "introduction": "This video discusses the differences between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). The speaker suggests that AI is a superset of ML and involves various fields such as natural language processing, vision, robotics, and more. Meanwhile, ML is a subset of AI that focuses on predictions and decisions based on data. The speaker also mentions Deep Learning (DL) as a subfield of ML that uses neural networks to model human-like thinking. The video provides a Venn diagram to illustrate the relationships between AI, ML, and DL.",
