  "introduction": "This video discusses the difference between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), focusing on their definitions and subfields. The speaker suggests that AI is the superset of ML and involves various fields such as natural language processing, vision, robotics, and text-to-speech conversion. The video also highlights the distinction between supervised and unsupervised machine learning, as well as deep learning, which involves neural networks with multiple layers.",
