  "introduction": "This video provides an introduction to dynamic programming, a technique for improving algorithm efficiency by storing intermediate results. It explains the concept with examples, using the Fibonacci sequence as a demonstration. The video also covers a bottom-up approach for solving the problem. The video is demonstrated in Python with a Jupyter Notebook.",
