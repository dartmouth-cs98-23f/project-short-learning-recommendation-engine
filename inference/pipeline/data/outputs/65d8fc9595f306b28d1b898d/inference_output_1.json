  "introduction": "This video discusses the process of building a system that automatically detects if a listing on a marketplace is selling a gun. The focus is on the imbalance sample and minimizing false positives and false negatives. The text in the data is leveraged for feature extraction, and a tree-based model, specifically a gradient boosted tree, is proposed as a starting point. The model is trained on a given set of data and predicts new data in the future, with the prediction accuracy depending on the length of the text and other features. Additional thoughts on data augmentation and model selection are also discussed.",
