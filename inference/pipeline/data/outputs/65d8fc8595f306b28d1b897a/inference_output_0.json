  "introduction": "In this video, the depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) traversal methods are covered, with examples provided for quick understanding. Both methods involve visiting vertices and exploring their adjacent vertices. DFS traverses the graph by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, while BFS traverses the graph by exploring all the vertices at the current depth before moving on to the next level. The time complexity of both methods is O(n).",
