  "introduction": "Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a fascinating field that focuses on the design and use of computer technology centered around the interactions between humans and computers. It involves understanding user needs, preferences, and behaviors to create interfaces that are intuitive and enjoyable to use. This video provides an overview of HCI, its interdisciplinary nature, practical applications, and key components. It also discusses various input gadgets, accessibility, augmented reality, voice assistants, variable devices, natural language processing, and other related topics.",
