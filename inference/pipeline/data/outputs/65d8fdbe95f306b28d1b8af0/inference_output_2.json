  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and its practical applications in the real world. HCI is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on the design and use of computer technology centered around the interactions between humans and computers. The video covers various aspects of HCI, including user-centered design, interaction design, user experience and user interface design, social computing, ethnographic studies, HCI design process, input gadgets, accessibility, augmented virtual reality, voice assistants, variable devices, natural language processing, and more.",
