  "introduction": "This video discusses the potential of quantum computers to solve some of the world's toughest problems. It explains how quantum computers work differently than regular computers by using qubits, which can be in multiple states at once. The video also covers the challenges of building and scaling up quantum computers, as well as the potential applications of quantum computing in various fields, including searching, protein folding, and data encryption. However, the video notes that even if scientists can build a powerful quantum computer, it may not be useful for everyday tasks.",
