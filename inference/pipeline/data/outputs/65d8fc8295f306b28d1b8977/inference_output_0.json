  "introduction": "This video introduces dynamic programming as a powerful technique for solving problems in a more efficient manner. It explains how dynamic programming applies to a large class of problems where a naive exhaustive search approach would have exponential complexity. The video also provides an overview of the four fundamental properties of dynamic programming: many choices, large number of choices, optimal solutions for smaller subproblems, and overlapping subproblems.",
