  "introduction": "Welcome to a webinar on quantum computing and its applications in data management and database optimization. In this presentation, we will explore the potential of quantum computing in these fields and learn about the use of category theory to establish a link between quantum computing and databases. We will also discuss the encoding of queries into quantum circuits and the simulation of these circuits on quantum computers. The presentation will cover the basics of quantum natural language processing (QNLP), the use of PennyLane for efficient quantum machine learning, and the limitations of quantum computer simulation. The speaker is Walter Rutila, a PhD student at the University of Helsinki, focusing on quantum computing in data management and database optimization.",
