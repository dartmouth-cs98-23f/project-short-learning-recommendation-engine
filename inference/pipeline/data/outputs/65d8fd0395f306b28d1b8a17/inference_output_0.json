  "introduction": "This video introduces assembly language as a human-readable abstraction on top of machine code for programmers. It explains the evolution of assembly languages and their use cases, including direct access to hardware and low-level performance issues. The video demonstrates how to write and compile assembly code using an assembler and a linker.",
