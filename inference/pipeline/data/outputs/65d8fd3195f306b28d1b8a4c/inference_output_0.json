  "introduction": "In this lecture, we will learn how to generate basic graphic types such as scatter plot, line plot, and bar plot using R. We will also discuss the need for more sophisticated graphics and introduce the ggplot2 package for generating beautiful graphics. This concludes our module on data science for engineers.",
