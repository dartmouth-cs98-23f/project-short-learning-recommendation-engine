  "introduction": "This video discusses the concept of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and its significance in various fields, including design innovation, computer science, digital products, and academic research. The speaker argues that HCI extends beyond computer science and redefines its boundaries, bringing assumptions and methods from disciplines like anthropology, sociology, and media studies. The video emphasizes the practical aspects of being a HCI researcher and the importance of cultivating competence in computer science and other related fields.",
