  "introduction": "This video explores the concept of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and its relevance to our daily lives. HCI is a field that focuses on the design and interaction between humans and computers. The video discusses the difference between HCI and other jobs in the computer science and engineering fields, the evolution of HCI, and its integration with other disciplines like anthropology, sociology, and media studies. It also highlights the importance of developing competence in computer science and other related fields to excel in HCI.",
