  "introduction": "This video discusses the concept of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and its relevance in various fields, including design innovation, computer science, digital products, and academic research. It argues that HCI extends beyond computer science and redefines its boundaries. The video also explores the practical aspects of HCI and its role in the development of new kinds of questions and possibilities brought about by technology.",
