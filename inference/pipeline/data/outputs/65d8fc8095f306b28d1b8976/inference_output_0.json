  "introduction": "This video provides an introduction to dynamic programming, a problem-solving technique in computer science that involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems. The video covers the basic premise of dynamic programming, its importance, and its challenges. It also explains the five steps for solving dynamic programming problems: identifying subproblems, finding appropriate subproblems, finding the solution to subproblems, mapping each box to the tallest stack height possible, and iterating through indices to find the tallest stack with the current box as the base.",
