  "introduction": "This video discusses the introduction to dynamic programming, an optimization technique used to solve problems that can be divided into smaller, overlapping subproblems. Dynamic programming divides a problem into series of subproblems, solves them, and combines their solutions to obtain the final answer. The approach is based on the optimal substructure principle, which means the problem is divisible and can be solved by solving its subproblems. The video covers the fundamentals of dynamic programming and its applications in various problems, including matrix chain multiplication, multistage graph, traveling salesman problem, longest common subsequence, sum of subset, all pair shortest path, and 01 knapsack.",
