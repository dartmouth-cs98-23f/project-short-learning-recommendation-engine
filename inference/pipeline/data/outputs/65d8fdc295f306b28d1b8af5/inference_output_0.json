  "introduction": "This video presents an overview of the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) study program offered by an Italian university. The program emphasizes technology for the benefit of people and focuses on problem-solving, exploring alternatives, and evaluating with users. The course is structured around a two-year, four-semester program with a blend of university-wide and core courses. The program emphasizes hands-on experience and collaboration with teachers who are open to discussions and ideas. The program is suitable for students with different objectives, and there are two types of admissions, documentation and intervention-based admissions. The course is not portfolio-based for online masters, but students need to submit their CV, motivation, and portfolio for the face-to-face master's program. The video covers topics such as interaction design, user experience evaluation, research methods in HCI, and complementary courses. It highlights the importance of the program's approach, which combines theoretical and practical aspects of HCI.",
