  "introduction": "This video presents an overview of the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) study program at an Italian university. The program emphasizes technology for the benefit of people and focuses on three main aspects: problem statement, finding solutions, exploring alternatives, and evaluating with users. The HCI program is a two-year, four-semester course with a foundation in university-wide courses, including an interdisciplinary course and controlled lab experiences. The program offers a variety of complementary courses, such as current topics in human interaction and human-computer interaction universal design. The program also features a practice course where students can invite guests to do practice about interaction design. The program is open to discussions and helping students develop their ideas. The program is considering a blended model study approach, allowing students to combine face-to-face and online learning. There are two types of admissions: documentation-based and intervention-based. The program is suitable for different objectives, and students can submit their CV or a portfolio for the online mastery. The program covers topics such as interaction design, user experience evaluation, and research methods in HCI. The program has a complexity score of 0.59 on the Complexity Scale.",
