  "introduction": "The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) study program offered by the Italian university focuses on technology for the benefit of people. The program emphasizes research-driven problem-solving, exploring alternatives, implementing solutions, and evaluating with users. It is a two-year, four-semester program that combines university-wide courses with specialized courses in interaction design, software development, and more. The program is open to discussions and helps students develop their ideas. The HCI study program is available both online and face-to-face, with a blended model planned for the future. There are two types of admissions: documentation-based and intervention-based. Students need to submit their CV for the online mastery, while face-to-face admissions require a city, motivation, and portfolio. The program covers topics such as interaction design, software development, and game design. The main difference between online and face-to-face mastery is the submission requirements.",
