  "introduction": "This video provides a basic introduction to database management systems (DBMS). It covers the basic definitions and functionalities of DBMS, as well as properties such as data coherence and purpose-built design. The video also illustrates a simplified database system environment and provides an example of a university database to help understand the concepts better.",
