  "introduction": "In this video, Subhas Khot, a theoretical computer scientist, discusses the study of what computers can and cannot do, known as computational problems. He highlights the large class of problems called NP-complete problems, which are difficult to solve. Khot also talks about the unique games conjecture, which states that certain computational problems are hard to solve, and its implications on other problems. Khot shares his progress on proving the unique games conjecture and his belief that they have an approach to prove it.",
