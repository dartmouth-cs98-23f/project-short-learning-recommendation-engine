  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of computer organization and architecture, with a focus on memory. It explains the role of memory in storing and retrieving data and the limitations of having a single large memory unit. The video introduces various types of memory storage, including primary memory (RAM), cache, and secondary memory (hard disks, SSDs, etc.), and their respective characteristics, such as speed, capacity, and cost.",
