  "introduction": "This video discusses the potential of quantum computers to solve optimization problems and the interactive aspect of quantum computing. It also explores the challenges in understanding the noise and lint in quantum systems and the high energy part of the spectrum. The panelists also touch on the interactive protocols used in quantum computing and the balance between quick readout and decoherence. The video also highlights the challenges in error correction and feedback.",
