  "introduction": "In this video, the speaker discusses the fundamental concepts in data science, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and data science itself. The speaker uses venn diagrams to illustrate the differences between these technologies and explains how a data scientist works with mathematical tools like statistics, probability, and linear algebra to create AI and ML applications. The video covers topics such as supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and advanced neural networks. The speaker also shares their personal experiences working on recommendation systems, time series sales data, and image recognition applications.",
