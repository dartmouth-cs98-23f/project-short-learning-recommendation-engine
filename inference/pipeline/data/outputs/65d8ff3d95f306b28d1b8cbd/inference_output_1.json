  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of the concept of 'Store Now, Decrypt Later' (SNDL) and its implications on encryption and data security. It explains how quantum computing can potentially break widely deployed public key algorithms in a relatively short timeframe, making it a serious threat to the security of sensitive information stored by individuals and organizations. The video also introduces the concept of lattice-based cryptography as an alternative to traditional public key algorithms.",
