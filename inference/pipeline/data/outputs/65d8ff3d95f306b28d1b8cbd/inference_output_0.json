  "introduction": "This video explains the concept of store now, decrypt later (SNDL) and how quantum computing can break encryption in a decade. It highlights the threat of quantum computing on widely deployed public key algorithms and the need for agencies to transition to supercomputers with the general number field sieve algorithm. The video also demonstrates how quantum computers can factor large prime numbers much faster than conventional computers using a simple example and a more complex one. It concludes by discussing the challenges of decoding messages using quantum computers and the importance of having good vectors to find the closest lattice point to the message point in a thousand dimensions.",
