  "introduction": "In this video, we discuss the von Neumann architecture, also known as stored memory architecture or program. The architecture focuses on the use of main memory to store both data and instructions. The main components include the arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), registers, control signals, and input/output (I/O) system. The video covers the benefits of these components and their roles in processing data. The video also explores the network topology for connecting these components.",
