  "introduction": "Predictive Modeling through Spatial Analysis and Data Science is a webinar session part of the National Government Webinar Series. The session will be recorded and participants will receive a link to the recording tomorrow. Speakers include Kate Hess, Solution Engineer for Geospatial Authorities Team, and Rami, Solution Engineer for Understanding, Predicting, and Prescribing. The session will cover deep learning, the Living Atlas, and population estimates. It will also discuss the challenges of delivering information with less people and less time, and the importance of sharing data from authoritative sources.",
