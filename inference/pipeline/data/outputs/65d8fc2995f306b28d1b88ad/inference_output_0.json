  "introduction": "Predictive modeling through spatial analysis and data science is a powerful tool for understanding and solving real-world problems. In this session, we will explore the use of geospatial analysis, deep learning, and living atlas to identify patterns, make predictions, and provide recommendations. We will also discuss the importance of accurate population estimates and the challenges faced by organizations in delivering high-quality data quickly.",
