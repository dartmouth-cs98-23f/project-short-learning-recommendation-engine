  "introduction": "Design thinking is a problem-solving approach that focuses on the needs of customers or users. It involves five consecutive stages: understanding the problem, defining the user's perspective, ideation, prototyping, and refining the idea. This method results in creative problem solving and innovative products and business segments, paving the way for more innovation.",
