  "introduction": "In this video, we will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of SQL and NoSQL databases. SQL databases are structured, relational, and vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are flexible, simpler to set up, and horizontally scalable. We will also cover eventual consistency and distributed databases in NoSQL systems.",

        "Eventual consistency is a tradeoff in distributed NoSQL systems, resulting in a small delay before updates propagate to other replicas.",
        "Single shard NoSQL databases can be strongly consistent, but to take advantage of scalability benefits, they should be set up as distributed clusters."
