  "introduction": "This video provides an introduction to computer architecture, focusing on the differences between architecture and microarchitecture. It explains how the IBM 360 was the first true instruction set architecture and how it introduced various tradeoffs in design, such as different storage sizes, data paths, and cache sizes. The video also highlights the distinction between different instruction set architectures, like IBM's PowerPC and x86, which cannot run each other's compiled code.",
