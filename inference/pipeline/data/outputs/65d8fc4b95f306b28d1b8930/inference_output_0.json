  "introduction": "This video discusses the relationship between algorithms and computer hardware, specifically focusing on quantum computers. It explains how quantum computers use a different instruction set than classical computers, allowing them to solve certain problems exponentially faster. The video covers areas where quantum speedups have been achieved, such as the simulation of quantum systems, number theoretic problems, and search problems. However, most of these algorithms are designed for future quantum computers with many qubits, and the current research is focused on understanding what can be done with small and modest-size quantum computers.",
