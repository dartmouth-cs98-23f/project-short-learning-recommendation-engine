  "introduction": "This video covers the study of human-computer interaction (HCI), which encompasses the ways in which people communicate with computers and engage with technological tools and structures. The video discusses the history of HCI and its development, as well as the fields that have contributed to its multidisciplinary nature. The focus has shifted to the development of accessible and inclusive system designs that facilitate natural and intuitive interactions between humans and technology.",
