  "introduction": "This video discusses quantum cryptography, a secure method of transmitting cryptographic keys using particles of light or photons. It explains how quantum cryptography is secure due to the properties of quantum mechanics, and how it follows a model developed in 1984. Despite its advantages, quantum cryptography has limits and challenges. The video also touches on a company's approach to tackling the quantum security front.",
