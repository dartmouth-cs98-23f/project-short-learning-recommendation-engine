  "introduction": "This video explains the basics of rendering in computer graphics, focusing on offline rendering and not real-time scenarios. It discusses how rendering works by sending rays from the camera to objects in the scene, intersecting them with light sources, and computing the resulting colors. The video also covers different use cases, such as reflecting light onto objects and computing reflections.",
