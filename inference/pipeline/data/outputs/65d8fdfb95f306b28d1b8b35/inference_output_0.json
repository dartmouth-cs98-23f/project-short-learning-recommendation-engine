  "introduction": "This video explores the top programming languages for junior developers to learn in 2023. The iceberg of programming languages is divided into five levels, each with its own theme. The first level focuses on languages that enable learning one of them will allow building almost anything, and a career in software engineering. The second level includes scripting languages that are popular among programmers who prefer interacting with the terminal. The third level features high-performance languages like Go, which are designed for low-level systems. The fourth level comprises languages that are widely used or historically important but not suitable for modern software development. The final level delves into assembly, the absolute lowest level of learning as a software engineer. The video concludes with a discussion on the scariest place of all - the human mind and the question of knowledge epistemology.",
