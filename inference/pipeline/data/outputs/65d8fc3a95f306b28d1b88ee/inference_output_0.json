  "introduction": "This video introduces eight design patterns every developer should know, focusing on creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. The factory pattern is covered first, followed by the singleton pattern, observer pattern, strategy pattern, adapter pattern, and facade pattern. The video also touches on more complex patterns like binary search trees and linked lists.",
