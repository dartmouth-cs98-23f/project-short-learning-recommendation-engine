  "introduction": "In this video, we will explore software architecture in a practical way. We will discuss the importance of functional and nonfunctional requirements, additional restrictions, and the balance between foreseeing and prioritizing. We will also cover different architectural patterns and their pros and cons, and how to pick the best pattern for your use case. The video aims to help viewers better understand software design challenges, prepare for technical interviews, and learn design patterns for web applications.",
