  "introduction": "Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is the study and practice of designing interactive products to support people in their everyday and working lives. It focuses on the design of the computer technology and the interaction between human users and computers. The goal of HCI is to ensure usability, making computer systems more user-friendly and receptive to user needs. This video provides an overview of HCI, its principles, techniques, and applications in various fields.",
