  "introduction": "In this video, we will explore the concept of predictive systems using Python and machine learning. We will look at the iris data set, which contains information about iris flowers, including their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and type. We will discuss the machine learning tasks associated with the iris data set, the train-test split, and the importance of feature selection. We will also cover the concept of classification and its application to the iris data set.",
