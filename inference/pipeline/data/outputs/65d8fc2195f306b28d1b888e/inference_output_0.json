  "introduction": "In this video, the basic building blocks of a processor design are explored, leading to a simple design for executing instructions. The design includes load store, branch, and jump instructions, as well as arithmetic logical and comparison operations. The processor design is built step-by-step, starting with simple instructions and gradually adding more complexity.",
