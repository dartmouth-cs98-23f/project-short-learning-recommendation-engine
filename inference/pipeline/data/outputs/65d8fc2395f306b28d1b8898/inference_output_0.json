  "introduction": "This video provides an introduction to instruction set architecture (ISA) and its role in processor design. ISA is defined as the set of commands that a processor can execute to execute program instructions. The video also discusses the instruction format, which defines the layout of machine instructions in terms of operation code, operand, and addressing mode. The instruction format supported by the processor depends on its instruction set architecture.",
