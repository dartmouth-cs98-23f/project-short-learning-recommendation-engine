  "introduction": "This video provides an insight into the importance of effective preparation for technical interviews, specifically for senior and principal engineering roles at large companies such as Amazon. The video emphasizes the need to focus on system design and leadership skills, in addition to coding. The author recommends a 30:30:40 split between coding, system design, and leadership preparation for senior engineers, and 20:40:40 for principal engineers.",
