  "introduction": "This video introduces the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its two main ideas: natural language understanding and natural language generation. NLP involves processing language, understanding its meaning, and generating human-like responses. The video explores a simple task called language modeling, where the model predicts the next word in a sentence based on the previous words. The model learns the right representation for each word and combines them into a shared representation for the whole sentence. This is the foundation for more complex NLP tasks like translation, question answering, and instruction control for household robots.",
