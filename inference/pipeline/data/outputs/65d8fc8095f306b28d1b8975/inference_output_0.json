  "introduction": "In this video, the speaker shares their experience of struggling to find a job in software engineering despite having high expectations for salary and work culture. They discuss how they had to quickly learn data structures and algorithms to pass coding interviews at big tech companies like Google and Meta. The video covers the strategies and resources used to master these concepts and pass the interviews in just four weeks.",
