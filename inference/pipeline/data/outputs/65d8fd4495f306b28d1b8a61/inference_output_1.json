  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of how predictive modeling can be used in an educational setting, specifically focusing on detecting students who game the system. Predictive modeling is a type of supervised learning that aims to infer one specific aspect of the data, such as a student's predicted score on a future test or their engagement in an online course. The video demonstrates how to collect labels, build a model, and use it to make predictions about a student's behavior. It also highlights the potential applications of predictive modeling in education, such as informing teachers about student behavior and driving automated interventions to improve learning outcomes.",
