  "introduction": "In this video, we discuss the three major parts of software engineering interviews: coding, system design, and behavioral interviews. The coding interview focuses on algorithms and data structures, measuring the candidate's IQ and basic skills. System design interviews evaluate the candidate's ability to perform at the task and provide insights into their past data points. Behavioral interviews are subjective and require skilled interviewers to assess the candidate's fit for the company. The most relevant interview for startups is system design, while large organizations prioritize coding interviews. The course covers three sections: fundamentals, high-level design, and machine coding, with live classes for additional content and updates.",
