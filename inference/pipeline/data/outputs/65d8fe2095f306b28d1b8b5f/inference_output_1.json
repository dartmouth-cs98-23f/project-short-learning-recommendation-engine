  "introduction": "This video discusses the three major parts of software engineering interviews: coding, system design, and behavioral interviews. The coding interview focuses on algorithms and data structures, while the system design interview evaluates a candidate's ability to perform at a specific task based on their past data points. The behavioral interview is subjective and requires a skilled interviewer. The video also highlights the importance of understanding the entire process, including the Googleness factor, and the differences between various products and their features.",
