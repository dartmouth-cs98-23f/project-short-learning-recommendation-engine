  "introduction": "This video discusses the three major parts of software engineering interviews: coding, system design, and behavioral interviews. The coding interview focuses on algorithms and data structures, measuring a candidate's intelligence and coding skills. The system design interview assesses a candidate's ability to perform at a specific task and provides insights into their past data points to predict future performance. The behavioral interview is subjective and requires a skilled interviewer to evaluate a candidate's fit for the company. The video also highlights the importance of understanding the full process and the differentiators between the product and existing solutions in the market. The course covers three sections: fundamentals, high-level design, and machine coding, which evaluates coding, testing, and system design skills.",
