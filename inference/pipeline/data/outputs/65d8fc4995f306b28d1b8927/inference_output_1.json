  "introduction": "This video explores the foundations of cryptography and the development of encryption methods. The main branch of mathematics used for cryptography is number theory, which is introduced through the visionaire cipher and its limitations. The video then delves into the Diffie-Hellman protocol for exchanging secret keys securely.",
