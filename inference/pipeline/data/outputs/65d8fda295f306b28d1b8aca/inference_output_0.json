  "introduction": "This video discusses the user interface design, focusing on its importance in facilitating human-computer interaction. The user interface is a frontend application that allows users to manipulate and control software and hardware. It can be command-line based or graphical, depending on the hardware and software combinations. A popular software becomes more popular when its user interface is attractive, simple, responsive, and clear to understand. The video is divided into two categories: command-line interface and graphical user interface.",
