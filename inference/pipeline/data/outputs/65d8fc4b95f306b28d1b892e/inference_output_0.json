  "introduction": "This video discusses the concept of finding out if a function is constant or balanced. It explains the problem and the truth table for a constant function, as well as the concept of balanced functions. The video then focuses on quantum computing and how to make functions reversible. It introduces the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which is used to determine if a function is constant or balanced. The algorithm is explained in detail, and the video demonstrates how to apply it to a specific example.",
