  "introduction": "Relational algebra is a set of operations on relations that take one or more relations as input and produce a relation as output. It provides a theoretical foundation for relational databases and helps write optimized queries and understand database operations in detail. In this presentation, we will focus on the basics of relational algebra, covering the fundamental and additional operations, including the six fundamental operations (select, project, union, set difference, cartesian product, and rename) and additional operations like set intersection, assignment, inner join, natural join, equi join, theta join, division, and outer join.",
