  "introduction": "Welcome to Architecture All Access: CPU Architecture Part Two, where we explore the fascinating world of CPUs and their impact on our lives. This video series is led by Boyd Phelps, an expert in CPU design with over 23 years of experience in the field. In this part, we dive deeper into the architecture of CPUs, focusing on speculative execution, program decoding, and the front and back ends of the pipeline. Join us as we unravel the complexities of CPU design and appreciate the art and science behind it.",
