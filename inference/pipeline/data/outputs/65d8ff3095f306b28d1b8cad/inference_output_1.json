  "introduction": "Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a field of study that focuses on understanding how people interact with technology and designing interventions that make a difference to their lives. It combines academic and applied disciplines, involving analysis of situations, understanding human psychology and physiology, social interactions, and design processes, methods of evaluation, and understanding the nature of human experience. The goal is to create systems that are user-centered, practical, and effective in real-world scenarios.",
