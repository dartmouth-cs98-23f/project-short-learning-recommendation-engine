  "introduction": "In this video, we will discuss data schema design for a product page with a discussion forum and product reviews. The data schema design will be for an RDBMS, and we will create tables for product, images, reviews, and category. The video will cover the primary key, data structures, normalization, and other important concepts related to data schema design.",
