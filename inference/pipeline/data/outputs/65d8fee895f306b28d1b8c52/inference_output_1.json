  "introduction": "This video discusses the application of game theory in data science, focusing on the agent perspective and the problem of optimizing instances in competitive environments. The speaker presents results from various settings and compares them with Google's search algorithm. They propose a model called the sharp mediator, which satisfies fairness and turns out to be a potential game. The talk also covers practical aspects of implementing best response AI services for prediction, segmentation, and persuasion.",
