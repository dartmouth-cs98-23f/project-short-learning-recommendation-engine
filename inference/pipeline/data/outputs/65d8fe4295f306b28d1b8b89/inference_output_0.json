  "introduction": "This video explains the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to Adam, who wants to create an online store for home decor products. The video covers the six crucial phases of SDLC: planning requirements, requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment and maintenance. It also discusses the software requirements specification document (SRS) and the design document specification (DDS) in detail.",
