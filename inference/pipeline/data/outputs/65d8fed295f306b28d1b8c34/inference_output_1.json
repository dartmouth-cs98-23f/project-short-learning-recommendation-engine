  "introduction": "This video is an introductory theoretical computer science course for Georgia Tech masters and PhD programs. Lance Fortnow, a professor in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech, and Charles Brubaker, a PhD graduate from Georgia Tech and Udacity course developer, present the course. The course explores the big questions about the limits of computation, problems that no computer will ever solve, problems that can't be solved quickly, and the kinds of problems we can solve efficiently. Understanding the power and limitations of algorithms is crucial for developing smarter, faster, and safer computers. The course takes an abstract view of computing, allowing us to understand the inherent ease or hardness of computation problems independent of specific machine limitations. The course has stood the test of time and remains valuable today. By following the rigorous arguments made in the course, you will improve your thinking and decision-making skills, enabling you to articulate more rigorous arguments in support of your ideas.",
