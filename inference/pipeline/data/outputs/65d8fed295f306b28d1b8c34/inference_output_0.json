  "introduction": "This video provides an introduction to the theoretical computer science course for the Georgia Tech Masters and PhD programs. It covers the big questions in computing, such as the limits of computation, problems that no computer will ever solve, and problems that can't be solved quickly. The course focuses on understanding the power and limitations of algorithms and their practical applications in real-world scenarios. It takes an abstract view of computing, allowing participants to recognize when problems are intractable and when there is an efficient solution. This course improves thinking and decision-making skills, making individuals better prepared for engineering and business challenges.",
