  "introduction": "This video explores the concept of highdimensional space in machine learning and its visualization using techniques such as t-SNE. It highlights how the computer can cluster related data points in highdimensional space without being told the meaning of the data. The video also showcases the use of t-SNE in various applications, including word clustering and image classification.",
