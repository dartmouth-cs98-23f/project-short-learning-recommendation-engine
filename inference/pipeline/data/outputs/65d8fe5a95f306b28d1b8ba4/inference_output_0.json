  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of human-computer interaction (HCI) in web design, focusing on the relationship between users and their website experience. HCI is a multidisciplinary field that emphasizes solving problems through effective and efficient design. Design thinking is introduced as a key concept in HCI design, involving listening, observation, and problem-solving. The video covers the importance of understanding user needs and creating a usable interface. Design thinking is applied to the design process, with a focus on emphasizing, defining, ideating, prototyping, and testing. The video concludes with a discussion on design thinking and its role in web design.",
