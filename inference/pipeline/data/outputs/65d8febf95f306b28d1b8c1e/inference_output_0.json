  "introduction": "This video showcases the use of reinforcement learning to develop more lifelike and responsive physically simulated characters. The character learns to perform lifelike motions by imitating human motion data such as walking, running, and sword swings. The character is trained for 10 years in simulation thanks to nvidia's massively parallel GPU simulator, which takes only 3 days of real-world time. After training, the character can perform a variety of motor skills and can be controlled using natural language commands.",
