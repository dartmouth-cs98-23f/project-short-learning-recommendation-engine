  "introduction": "This video discusses the roles of data analyst, data scientist, data engineer, and machine learning engineer in the data science field. It highlights the importance of having a dominant knowledge of data analysis and data science, but not necessarily indepth understanding of competitive coding or data structure algorithms. The video also emphasizes the role of software engineers in integrating these models into enterprise software systems. The video covers the day-to-day tasks of machine learning engineers and data engineers, including working with big data systems and writing efficient software.",
