  "introduction": "This video discusses how indexes work and improve the performance of SQL queries, specifically focusing on clustered and nonclustered indexes. It also covers the importance of creating indexes to find data efficiently, using index scans, and the impact of indexes on execution plans. The video also covers the estimated subtree cost with and without indexes, providing valuable insights into the performance impact of indexes.",
