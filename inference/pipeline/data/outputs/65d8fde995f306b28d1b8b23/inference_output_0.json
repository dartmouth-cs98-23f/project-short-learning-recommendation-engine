  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of software testing, its process, and its importance in ensuring the quality of software products. It explains how software testing is not a standalone activity but rather a predefined process that involves both static and dynamic testing to find defects prior to launching the application. The video also highlights the correlation of software testing with other testing concepts in the market and with various applications within the software space.",
