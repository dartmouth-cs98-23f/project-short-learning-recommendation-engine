  "introduction": "Data science is a field that uses data to solve real company problems. The job of a data scientist involves making complicated models, data visualizations, and writing code. Data science has evolved from data mining to knowledge discovery in databases, making it possible to train machines with a data-driven approach. The focus is on how much impact a data scientist can have with their work, not just on the complexity of their models. This video provides real-life examples of data science jobs in Silicon Valley.",
