  "introduction": "In this video, the four core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are introduced: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. OOP aims to solve the problems of spaghetti code by grouping related variables and functions into objects, allowing for better organization, reusability, and maintenance.",
