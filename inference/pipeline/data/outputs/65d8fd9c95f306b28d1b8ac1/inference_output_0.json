  "introduction": "This video is a session on human-computer interaction and user interface design hosted by Tony Tang and Anastasia Kuzminik at the University of Toronto. The session focuses on the mapping problem, which involves understanding how people map one series of things to another series of inputs. The speakers discuss the importance of making humans and computers understand each other in the context of integrating computers into natural communication. They also touch on the concept of proximix, which deals with the way people organize their space and territory. The session includes a discussion on the five categories of personality, approachability, sentiment, professionalism, intelligence, and individuality in relation to agents.",
