  "introduction": "This video is about human-computer interaction and user interface design, hosted by Tony Tang, an associate professor at the University of Toronto. The session covers a mapping problem, focusing on how people map one series of things to another series of inputs. The video discusses the importance of understanding humans and computers to create successful communication and integrating computers into natural communication. The session concludes with a 15-minute break and the next session, 'Leave from wherever you are skills for an evolving profession' by Miriam Burgos, Marion Philips, Chris Stewart, and Harris Smith from the University of Southern California.",
