  "introduction": "In this video, we will discuss time complexity analysis, its types, and essential steps to evaluate it. We will also examine the time complexity of various algorithms, including insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, linear search, and binary search. By understanding time complexity and its importance, we can become more efficient programmers and optimize our code.",
