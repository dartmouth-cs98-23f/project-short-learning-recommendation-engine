honestly its a great question because just the name human computer interaction is kind of weird and very vague and actually the degree in general is pretty vague so what is a human computer interaction degree and is it worth it and do the costs outweigh the value my name is sasha c im actually a ux designer so i am actually currently in the field getting a masters at depaul university in human computer interaction and i want to tell you guys a little bit about what exactly it is what to expect and if its actually worth it so people are fascinated including myself by the connection of computers and people now there are several different fields of study that are growing dedicated to algorithms and studies and research just based on ways on how technology can help improve peoples everyday lives so what exactly is human computer interaction what do these weird words even mean so im actually just going to read a complete definition and then just kind of give my own definition so human computer action is an area of study that involves better understanding so now muskription of what hci is so hci is a really broad term and its really just the development and research of ways you can improve peoples lives through technology thats the best way that i can really describe it you have to like kind of understand that youre incorporating so many different things youre considering the user the business behind whatever youre making so you have to understand what the goal is for whatever youre making are you trying to make money are you trying to educate are you trying to entertain and then you also have to work with whats actually functionally possible such as like developers if youre like putting together this prototype and you give it to a developer and theyre like yo i cant do this it wont work there are so many different jobs in that field it is kind of crazy so specifically just for example im a ux designer this is really just the idea that i design systems that improve either businesses or peoples lives every single day so personally a lot of the clients that i work with are actually business related so a lot of the things that im working on are technologies that can help improve business functions and business value there are research scientists where literally like apple or microsoft will hire you to literally just do simple research on the process of how people are using their technology and then there are product designers they really focus on more visuals id say they focus on like ui elements how people visually interact with interfaces online and that goes into another role which you can do which is ui design which is literally just developing user interfaces and a user interface is pretty much just anything that a user can interact with so think of your iphone screen thats a user interface or a website that is also a user interface there are information architects and this is pretty much just the research of how people are processing information when going through a design process and i actually think this one can go past just technology ive seen information architects work on things such as like hospital systems where physical patients are actually going through a system and theyre really researching the process that each patient is going through and developing a better system for it and just to list off a couple more things you can be a tech startup a computer programmer a systems engineer really a lot of frontend development and front end really means like the visuals and what the user is seeing so getting back into the major a little bit and why exactly you would want to study human computer interaction other than just getting these jobs if youre interested in any of these things id probably say that yeah you should probably look into it and see if its a right career path for you if you are interested in solving super complex problems you love working with other people pretty much all day you enjoy working with computers you have a base understanding of how a computer works and youre looking for a challenging yet fulfilling job which honestly pays pretty well thats thats another good side note and if you really want to make impact on peoples lives through technology then this is the right major for you so just to list off some of the classes that ive taken so far at depaul university studying hci ive completed user research methods statistics and data analysis website design scripting for interactive systems hci fundamentals global user research learned center design behavioral science and user experience those are literally just a few classes that ive taken so far but that kind of gives you a little bit of an idea of the classes that you will be taking so the reason you guys are here is it worth it getting a hdi masters degree i would say yes however i think this goes person to person you should always be outweighing your costs how much it is to go to whatever school that you applied to and if the value really outweighs how much youre paying and fortunately when it comes to hci i think the knowledge and honestly just project earnings that you get when in school far outweigh the cost that you pay this is just me but thats my opinion now since im actually working in the industry at the same time getting my masters degree you may be asking why are you doing that and honestly its just because i love learning about the topic and i think getting a masters degree in it just proves that im really passionate about it it shows employers that im really wanting to do this for a living and its something that really excites me its also worth noting that you get paid more when you have a masters degree in it so yes in the end i do think it is worth it getting the degree i think youll enjoy the studies a lot and you will be challenged a lot a lot of this is a lot of theory and idea seeking understanding statistics and data analysis that is all really critical when doing user research and honestly some of it cannot be very fun like i said there are so many careers that you can really go down and that alone i think is worth the hci component so one thing that i also want to know because people ask me all the time is will you have to code in this degree and yes you will only for a little bit though my introductory classes were a lot of coding usually a lot of frontend coding i didnt really do a lot of like back end but you will have to learn like javascript html css just the basics youre not going to be like developing a super complex app but you will be making interfaces and making things that people can interact with youd be surprised how quickly you can catch on and finally before i end the video obviously you have to gain experience youre not going to get these jobs like that just by having a degree you do have to work a little bit find some clients maybe yourself and get some knowledge in the actual field because there are so many skills that the degree may not teach you such as like inner personal skills that youll have to do literally just in business so i hope that gave you guys a little bit of an idea of what human computer interaction is because it is a very odd name for a degree however i cannot recommend the degree enough ive learned so much and ive had so much fun learning everything in it if you guys want to know anything else or have any questions feel free to comment in the comment section give this video a like give me a subscribe im uploading every single week so i hope to catch you guys in the next one im out peace
