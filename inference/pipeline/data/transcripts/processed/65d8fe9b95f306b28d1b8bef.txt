develop an application whether youre writing some code editing a video or making the 3d model there are many factors you may want to consider sometimes when designing we focus too much on the visuals in such a way where we design for ourselves rather than the user putting your personality into what you create is great as long as it doesnt interfere with the users journey if youre on a computer take a look at your mouse and keyboard think about how these tools evolved over the years what has stayed the same why do you own this particular pair because of their color or because you like the way they feel it could be both but one thing is for sure everybody wants to be comfortable but what is comfort can you design something comfortable the answer is yes with a number of methods human computer interactions can help you develop a more userfriendly interface and application its the study and collection of data based on human factors focusing on designing cognitively for the users all the senses especially sound sight and touch need to be considered measurements of users how they identify ensuring that your application is inclusive for various types of users is imperative to creating a more userfriendly experience but how and when can you implement hci it may vary depending on the service or product youre developing in this case lets say youre developing a website if youre an experienced designer then you can probably go ahead and start coding otherwise it can pay off to start doing some research see what websites are popular what are users currently used to whats the layout like the more familiar your interface is the more comfortable the user feels fun fact when a user interacts with an interface that does not feel natural the size of their pupils change during your research you may notice that for instance bank sites all look alike it might be worth looking into your industry how does the leading brand have their web designed when youre done inserting content and start adding colors effects font families and font weights itll be important to do some research on color blindness and how users may perceive colors differently visual impairment is common and there are ways to design for this instance consider what colors you use when establishing important interactions when youve got your site prepared invite some participants to test your product or service survey them and see how you can improve your design when we design we typically have the users interest in mind but its important to know that the users interest is a part of the development itself
