probably the most asked question i get in the  comments and dms is what computer setup we have we have recently updated our pcs so i think  it’s a perfect topic for todays video today i will present my new setup  tell you why i chose each component   and give you some tips along the way in the end i will let you know  how much i paid for everything also big thanks to rebusfarm  for sponsoring this video i don’t do it myself as i don’t  have any knowledge about it   but even if i did i think it’s better  to outsource it to professionals in my case the whole cost of choosing the parts   ordering them and putting everything  together was less than 100 we built our previous setup in 2018 time flies fast it was definitely time for an upgrade   as working became pretty hard  recently due to outdated hardware in each category i will show you what  parts i had before for comparison     let’s start with the cpu we went from a 7thgeneration intel  processor to a 13thgeneration the cost of this cpu is about 680 processor is very important to me because  i do a lot of cpu rendering in corona vray has an option to use cpu gpu or hybrid  mode which uses both cpu and gpu at the same time but in corona we can only render using cpu because of that i bought a  pretty good cpu at the time   it was actually way more  expensive than my new one i think it cost around 1700 back then this cpu simply got old and i replaced  it with intel core i913900k which   is a good value for money and  it’s enough for my current needs now i don’t need a super powerful cpu   because usually i render overnight and when i  need to render something quickly i use rebusfarm here is the processor specification it has 24 cores of which 8 are  performance cores and 16 are efficient it has 32 threads and a clock speed of 3 ghz  in base mode with up to 58 ghz in turbo mode if you want to know how these  parameters affect working and rendering check out my video where i  discuss computer specs in detail link in the description below the video with gpu we went from nvidia  gtx 1070 to nvidia rtx 4090 luckily i haven’t paid  anything for this graphic card i was given it by the nvidia team for review   the detailed video about that  is coming next week stay tuned the cost of this card is about 1800 as you can imagine working with my  old card started to be really hard   so that’s the most important update for me when i was building my previous setup in 2018 i simply decided i want to put the majority of my   budget into cpu to be able to render  fast and spent way less money on gpu as it wasn’t so important back then now i think even though you might  mainly use cpu for example for rendering   you still need a powerful gpu  especially if you do or want to   start with realtime rendering  video editing or animations most of the software depends on gpu right now  as it delivers more costefficient performance here are some specs as you can see it has more than 16   thousand cores the boost clock is  252 ghz and it has 24gb of vram this gpu is a beast here is the vray gpu performance  as you can see it’s very fast if you don’t have a budget for a good enough  computer you running out of time or simply have   too many frames to render on a single machine  i have a great solution for you  rebus farm and the best part is that you can  get started with their free trial they are a perfect render  farm for archviz artists   because they support all the popular software but most importantly they have all the plugins we  need so there won’t be any unpleasant surprises there are no hidden costs you  know how much you will pay for   every render if you use their cost estimation tool they are also great people  they have 247 human support   so if you encounter any issues during the process  they will quickly solve the problem for you as i told you you can  start with their free trial i will put the link to their website in  the corner and in the description below   so you can check them out and  sign up for your free trial for me 64gb of ram is a must  which in some cases wasn’t enough   so i decided to upgrade it to 128 gb the 4 times 32 gb of ram cost me a total of 320 i haven’t used my old 64gb of ram  because the new one is faster ram is used basically to store working data if you work as a professional i advise  you to take at least 32 gb of ram   but in some cases it may not be  enough so 64 gb will be way better i don’t think 16gb is enough  for today’s standards basically it depends on what  type of projects you are doing if you’re doing simple visualizations or  animations it will be fine but if you are doing   the complex ones with highly high polygon counts  you use highresolution textures or you work on   scenes that have thousands of objects included  you will need to go with 64 or even 128 gb of ram otherwise you will struggle with  optimizing your scenes to make it work next the motherboard i’m not gonna read  this name you can see it in the corner  the cost of this model was around 360 motherboard doesn’t affect the overall performance   but this is a part that connects all  the parts of the hardware together so if you building a pc you should check if the   components you are planning to buy  are compatible with the motherboard also the ports like usb usbc etc come  from the motherboard so pay attention to that my new motherboard also comes with  bluetooth and wifi connectivity   which was quite important for me i actually kept the same ssd and haven’t  updated it as it’s fine for now also i struggle with time  and wanted to keep the system   software and everything as it was  until i finish my ongoing projects but i might upgrade it later on it’s only 1tb of space but i have 2  servers so i don’t store any files on my pc if i don’t have a server i would go for 1tb ssd   where i would have the system   all the software installed and another ssd drive for  all the files  projects the size of the second ssd depends on your needs this way the setup is faster as software  is loading from a separate drive than files this kind of setup with the main 1tb ssd and the  secondary 2tb ssd would cost you around 260 i put zero here as i used my old ssd  cooling is super important i went with cooler master masterliquid lite which cost me around 70 as we do a lot of heavy work  the computer can get really hot in my previous setup i’ve been  struggling with cooling a lot   as it wasn’t done correctly from the start the computer was often overheating  and was sometimes really loud this time i really wanted  to have this done correctly i have had my new setup for a couple of weeks now  and i can say i can recommend this cooling system i have tested it with all kinds of  work now and i don’t have any issues it’s also very quiet in  comparison to the previous setup last but not least the case i bought a be quiet pure base  500dx black case for 120 i wasn’t very happy with the  previous case as it was not solid it was stressful when moving from one place to  another because some parts can easily fall off this time i was looking for a solid case normally i would prefer the case  without led lights and glass doors but i bought it with this video in mind it looks way better on the video and  thumbnail than a simple black box  cost summary as all the components are covered let’s summarize all the costs as you can see setup like this  costs 37 hundred dollars of   which the biggest cost is the graphics card in my case the upgrade cost me only 16 hundred  as i got the gpu and kept the ssd untouched i am super happy with that i think it will help me deliver   betterquality videos faster for you guys  if you want to learn all about  arch viz check out my website if you are
