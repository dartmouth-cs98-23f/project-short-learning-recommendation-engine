our memories make us who we are helping us remember our past learn and retain skills and plan for the future and for the computers that often act as extensions of ourselves memory plays much the same role whether its a twohour movie a twoword text file or the instructions for opening either everything in a computers memory takes the form of basic units called bits or binary digits each of these is stored in a memory cell that can switch between two states for two possible values 0 and 1 files and programs consist of millions of these bits all processed in  the central processing unit or cpu that acts as the computers brain and as the number of bits needing to be processed grows exponentially computer designers face  a constant struggle between size cost and speed like us computers have shortterm memory for immediate tasks and longterm memory  for more permanent storage when you run a program your operating system allocates area within the shortterm memory for performing those instructions for example when you press a key in a word processor the cpu will access one of these locations to retrieve bits of data it could also modify them or create new ones the time this takes is known  as the memorys latency and because program instructions must be processed quickly and continuously all locations within the shortterm memory can be accessed in any order hence the name random access memory the most common type of ram  is dynamic ram or dram there each memory cell consists of a tiny transistor and a capacitor that store electrical charges a 0 when theres no charge or a 1 when charged such memory is called dynamic because it only holds charges briefly before they leak away requiring periodic recharging to retain data but even its low latency  of 100 nanoseconds is too long for modern cpus so theres also a small  highspeed internal memory cache made from static ram thats usually made up  of six interlocked transistors which dont need refreshing sram is the fastest memory  in a computer system but also the most expensive and takes up three times  more space than dram but ram and cache can only hold data as long as theyre powered for data to remain once the device is turned off it must be transferred  into a longterm storage device which comes in three major types in magnetic storage  which is the cheapest data is stored as a magnetic pattern on a spinning disc coated with magnetic film but because the disc must rotate  to where the data is located in order to be read the latency for such drives is 100000  times slower than that of dram on the other hand opticalbased storage like dvd and bluray also uses spinning discs but with a reflective coating bits are encoded as light and dark spots using a dye that can be read by a laser while optical storage media are cheap and removable they have even slower latencies  than magnetic storage and lower capacity as well finally the newest and fastest types of longterm storage are solidstate drives like flash sticks these have no moving parts instead using floating gate transistors that store bits by trapping  or removing electrical charges within their specially designed  internal structures so how reliable  are these billions of bits we tend to think of computer memory as stable and permanent but it actually degrades fairly quickly the heat generated from a device and its environment will eventually demagnetize hard drives degrade the dye in optical media and cause charge leakage  in floating gates solidstate drives  also have an additional weakness repeatedly writing to floating gate  transistors corrodes them eventually rendering them useless with data on most current storage media having less than  a tenyear life expectancy scientists are working to exploit the physical properties of materials down to the quantum level in the hopes of making  memory devices faster smaller and more durable for now immortality remains out of reach for humans and computers alike
