especially why 3d computer graphics our course title is digital design and visualization why visualization matters even simply say very pragmatic very practical reason for enhancing your design visualization skills okay how to enhance your design technique design representation techniques another one for moving forward to advanced design computing issues such as being okay you have to know geometry modeling first and then move to information modeling approach him approach and even more advanced approaches okay main focus is here enhancing your design representation design visualization skills okay lets briefly take a look again history of computer aided design history of cad is a history of how to understand design what is design ok around the 50 years ago when the sketch pad the first caddy system okay line drawing header system computers computer system invented at that time people believed that the design is a drawing of the product that is why we are focusing on elevation plans perspective was something line drawings okay so geometric drafting in 2d was the cad system at the time but some smart people invented 3ds of his face the model approach okay sophie space the 3d representation its 3d okay you can rotate this box you can see it happy front view section and so on geometric surface modeling in 3d that is socalled surface based 3d model even smarter people suggested and implemented 3d solid modeling approach why solid think about this one surface phase 3d looking object looking 3d but surface doesnt have thickness in other words its mathematical definition not real object but can you find zero thickness object in their world there is nothing there is nothing like that in other words in real world even if its very very thin or very lightweight anyway it has thickness it has weight okay so we need to sort the feel in the definition of geometry so there is solely the model realistic okay even smarter people invented suggested and invented a parametric model okay point line they are all mathematical definition something abstract something unreal its not realistic in real world we are using with its depth thickness height what if you want to control this one change higher height and then this one going to be updated okay not controlling parties or lines and so on the most advanced one is here entire rest of things are the part of this one more information what kind of information compositional analytical and fabrication representations of the product going to be part of this model so there is building information modelling this semester we are still focusing on this one what if you use only 2d cad characters to the drawing trees thats going to be here but thankfully we are here but the problem is its exactly same to sketchup but lots of powerful and predefined well defined as facts of design visualization things in 3d max and related tools so this is the focus of this master how about next semester rest of things and this one also one part of the next semesters these are design and beam course ok anyway this is the scope of this semester some prob others of course the subject but not domain anyway in my poetry is here ok lets quickly review design mode we have learned before very simple mode of thought your brain no one can see your brain ok what is the inside of your head ok its not possible before you you are saying something you are drawing something you are creating some computer file visualization or something else before doing that no one can see your idea but its very still important to you guys take a look the description next one is mode of expression something to be visualized final stage of course mode of production ok no need to say anyway take a look visual equivalent visually equivalent to your design concept design idea design approach ok visualization is the most important thing you need to achieve in in your design expression mode okay how about design media design by hand for several thousands of thousand years compared to human history more than 99 of history used hand drawing ok pencil or pens whatever it is but in this class we are using computers but i told you just 40 60 years ago computer has invented carry systems just four years okay your computer  3d max 2015 released two years ago okay anyway were gonna use computers designed by penciled computing thats the change we encountered the pencil is the most basic media of design nowadays you can simply quickly draw by hand for your design okay thats your kind of primitive idea schedule or something but this is design computing course we have lots of it lots of technologies were gonna use new media thats why i call digital design this is the design media okay you have to maximize the effect the power of your media okay your media in this room in this class of course its computers you are using smartphones tablets some mobile devices mostly for fun or for communicating with friends but anyway you can use such some it tools for your design something productive things here is an example student walk freshman walk okay freshman walk they didnt know any computer software for design but they have learned the sketchup puree some renderers photoshop and they could make this kind of visualization how about this one jewish museum slip box some something not 100 but anyway looking realistic looking realistic visualizations line stroke sketchup visualization scale styles i assume that you are already wellknown to design visualization using rhino autocad sketchup play array but in this master 3d max design 3d max design and auto material mentalray some technical aspects regarding such tourists and autodesk tours some primitive introductory things about autodesk revit and so on okay thats the skull last week i show you this one before what you have to learn are listed up here some gray phones hardware internet software operating systems some fundamentals in engineering theory but anyway focus on fundamentals in the lecture in the lecture im gonna let you know what is the critical one dementors of design computing theories okay we have midterm exam november 21st regarding my lecture oh okay based upon my lecture youre gonna have the elec exam in the lab exercise hours i told you again and again in 3d max design mentor eight were a photoshop intro to rabbit and possible some more applications its up to you anyway thats the subject for lab exercise even more things about design computing such as 3d printing in this semester youre gonna asked you want to be asked to print something create something by 3d max and print them out using 3d max sorry 3d printers laser scan photogrammetry virtual reality they are one one of the subjects were gonna deal with in this semester okay lets take a look at this 3d rendering okay this is kind of very famous image okay this is not a picture of course its a computergenerated image render image so if you click this you can find out some website link 3d rendering on the wikipedia there is the image okay actually its not important but anyway gears tran with appareil using radiosity radiosity is one one of the technology is available nowadays in photorealistic rendering something like this even if its not kind of 3d max generated anyway by using 3d max and recently developed technologies you can make this kind of visualization even today actually but anyway lots of more and sophisticated handling you need but my point here is nowadays complete computing comfortable ideation technique is very very advanced what you need to do is take maximum advantages so we existing technologies techniques ok is this a picture or computer graphic why it doesnt matter my answer is it doesnt matter okay well of course this is computer generated this is ikea product no matter what it is no problem because visualization nowadays there is no difference between real picture and computer generated sometimes come to generated looking materialistic then pictures anyway take a look this interior some type of office layout is this a picture of course its computer generated how about this kitchen area computer generated icare icare provides you lots of some pdf file who are online brochure or even printout brochure for their products using computer graphics ok not real product why they made this kind of computer graphics take a look same product ikea product for kitchen ok kitchen cabinets but ikea is kind of global company something for northern america something for asia market something for europe european style market some different process different layouts a little bit different things be to local environment what if they have to take pictures for all of them they have to remove and reinstall take picture again and again but thanks to computer graphics they made them instantly okay much cheaper than real picture so take a look this guy im not sure he is walking in there anyway hes in charge of making these kind of real visualization if you click this link i just placed a reference for this one okay in the visual news website take a look the image that i show you okay okay 70 pipe by percenter like your product photographs actually comes to generated okay the chair i show you and the reason why they use this kind of come to graphics and so on okay so in this class like this guy we are going to use autodesk tizi sorry 3d max design 2015 because its the latest version in design model okay not 2016 or 17 2015 were a photoshop and video mentor ii do you know what is nvidia the company name and media is very very familiar to gamers if you play in game you may know and video nvidia geforce have you heard jeepers graphics card the geforce graphics card is one of the faster come to graphic system and come to graphic gpu engine gpu cardboard for computer graphics okay anyway the company and media both mental ray and mental ray is a media software anyway anyway thanks to mentor a and amount of welldefined professionals material in autodesk material you can make very photorealistic renderings and so on take a look this one is actually not 100 photorealistic but anyway looking photorealistic okay but actually i made this image in three minutes in 3d mix just three minutes so you need okay place selene doe and cylinder extraction in order to make this one is looking glass plane and tourist not lights render and you can get this kind of image how about this one last week i show you similar example teapot with ceramic material flow plane using wood floor crumbles and three lights to white color lights actually for three lights and one yellow color lights okay but the dark black background simply because the background of this image just nothing just to collect background that is why this one reflects black okay so just a five minute by minute for making this visualization my point here is computer graphics rendering technique really advanced take a look this example computer graphics on other come to graphics even by using sketchup easytouse application sketchup and the beret you can make this kind of thin okay thats my point very easy to use but i show you actually very poor realistic images is your photorealistic visualization always top priority what i mean is photorealistic rendering is always your top priority my answer is of course no okay your idea from your brain composed of your computer model computational model 3d max file sketchup file rhino file revit file whatever it is and then its going to be visualized lots of visualization so what should be realistic youll sketch your 3d your picture your animation sometimes they are visual photorealistic but i told you there is intermediate computer model so your comfort another supposed to be realistic in other words you should try your best for making your computational model intermediate model realistic not the outputs okay without this model directly from your brain from your idea to these outputs very recursive very time consuming tedious neverending task you have to do okay your computational model is kind of very realistic and well made your output sometimes line during shaded sometimes photorealistic rendering sometimes very nice representation sometimes very abstract lines truckbased images sometimes flow plans and so on okay semantic integrity that is that thing the concept you have to be aware of for your building model for your computational model perón has your mini world what is the world what is the universe of this course what is the ud your definition over your word okay okay when you design your building think about your designing your home your new house is there star wars characters is there some some other buildings is there some how can i say some monsters in your universe of this course of course not okay your tip well define delivers first and your object your over your interest supposed to be same to your realworld object okay this is semantic integrity semantically same with your realworld object you are pursuing in terms of your mini world in terms of your university of this course this university sorry not university its universe okay this universe doesnt need to be same to realworld universe realworld universe what is this what is that this university this one contains anything this one has 100 things we created what mother nature also one part of it anyway well defined your mini world your universe that is the important thing you need to take care of semantics this cad model looks very just line drawing and color shade thats it but this one is photorealistic which one is better in terms of visualization this is looking better but what if this one has any related information but this one has amount of information data on top of this image or behind this image this one has semantic integrity okay semantics so photorealistic visualization is not always the solution architectural effective visualization which has mental integrity is of importance thats the topic thats the thats the thing i like to emphasize ok lets quickly review something about rendering actually you have learned rendering aspects before 3d visualization by computers lets take a look rendering is all about lights ok ok take a look the series of very simplified image how about this one is this rendering is this rendering no why why no this is rendering ok this is rendering in lion stroke style i told you rendering what is rendering what is what is the literal meaning of brando if you open dictionary and find out render render means visual representation by hand by some type of media whatever so this is rendering but not photorealistic its lion stroke render how about this one colorful render how about this shaded with shadow casting how about this one entire thing with texture map how about this one raytraced okay so something advanced but anyway all of those visualizations are rendering what a realistic is here but anyway they are still effective render okay line stroke render and so on the right text here simply explains you something about computer rendering computer rendering three main things lighting your object camera okay lighting very important but sketchup rhino3d max they have their own default light but the port light is super low quality that is why you need to place your own light system because they have much better quality anyway you need to know something about light also you have to know something about camera its exactly same to real word the camera if you are very well known to dslr camera its very good very applicable to real camera object in 3d max or some other tools camera is still very important how about object of course its really critical your object what is diffuse the surface color so piece material as it seen by your eyes okay intensity texture map shadow casting ambient occlusion lots of sub objects some things you have to know reflection refraction caustics lots of things you need to know how many take a look this one you have to know those technical keywords for computer rendering but no worries not that complicated even if its looking complicated if you understood if you understand the carnism nothing and another cool news is this is something about query in sketchup you have learned last year in monterey there are amount of presets preset means predefined material defined by whom student no experts some professionals already defined to provide you this kind of thing you dont need to worry about those things todays lab exercise you will find out how it is easy to use and powerful ok take a look this one lighting source reflection but no acoustics this is caustics ok and take a look some type of ambient occlusion this is ray tracing ok there is a ray okay ray penetrating this glass make another lighting effect like this reflection from this green color but there is no korean effect this is not ray tracing okay this is radio city base there ray tracing technology applied something like manta ray anyway as a default were gonna use manta ray we use this one okay very powerful preset renders and very powerful autodesk material that is what youre gonna use today okay okay lets finish the lecture and move to the lab exercise installation and click preview
