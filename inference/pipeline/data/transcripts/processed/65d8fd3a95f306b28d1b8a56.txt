what is big data big data is extremely large or complex set of data and its so large that its difficult to process it using traditional database and software techniques every day we are creating approximately 25 quintillion bytes of data so where is this huge amount of data getting generated from earlier we had mobile phones with the functionality of calling and text messages or clicking some pictures maybe but with the new technologies like smartphones we have a lot of applications for music sports social media like facebook twitter linkedin and many more also data is getting generated when we shop online so why does it need attention as the data is growing companies are capturing the data that streams into their businesses they can apply analytics and get significant value from it with better speed and efficiency companies are leveraging the benefits of big data by analyzing the patterns and trends and predicting something useful out of it for example companies like amazon and netflix use big data to improve customer experience as we see here from the statistics shown by 2020 17 megabytes of data will be created every second for each human this needs immediate attention because this data cant be just thrown away its going to give profit to the businesses big data challenges big data is not just about the volume of data it poses other challenges as well like velocity and variety as a volume 40 zettabytes of data will be created by 2020 this huge volume of data is either human generated like from social media youtube or candy machine generated like through sensors and personal health trackers and can also be generated with organizations like card details commercial transactions and medical records another challenge is velocity the speed at which data is coming into the system the data needs to be processed with faster speed and then there is variety of data data is not only structured but unstructured and semistructured data like images videos and tweets so how our enterprise is using this big data today let us see big data popular use cases internet of things these are numerous ways in which analytics can be applied to internet of things for example sensors are used to collect data that can be analyzed to achieve actionable insights tracking customer or product movement etc many enterprises are creating a dashboard application that provides a 360degree view of the customers that pulls data from a variety of sources analyzes it and presents it to customer service so that allows them to gather the rich insights about businesses big data popular use cases are related information security and data where has optimisations big data tools are being used to remove some of the burdens from the data warehouses even the healthcare industry is looking for patterns and treatment that lead to the best outcomes for patients the main challenge of big data is storing and processing the data at a specified time span the traditional approach is not efficient in doing that so hadoop technology and various big data tools have emerged to solve the challenges faced in the big data environment so there are a lot of big data tools and all of them help the user in some or another way in saving time money and uncovering business insights these can be divided into the following categories like data storage and management for example the no sequel databases such as mongodb cassandra neo j and hbase are popular nice no sequel databases the talent hadoop microsoft hd inside and zookeeper are popular for data storage and management tools next broad category is data cleaning data needs to be cleaned up and wellstructured examples of such tools which help in defining and reshaping the data into useable data sets are microsoft excel and open refine data mining is a process of discovery in sites within a database some of the popular tools used for data mining are terra data and rapid miner data visualization tools are a useful way of conveying and complex data insights in a pictorial way that is easy to understand for example tableau and ibm watson analytics and plotly are the common tools for data reporting power bi tools are used data ingestion is the process of getting the data into hadoop ford which can be done using scooped flume or storm data analysis requires asking questions and finding the answers and data the popular tools used for data analysis are hive pig mapreduce and spark data acquisition is also used for acquiring the data for which scoop flume or storm tools are quite popular the popular big data tools offer a lot of advantages which can be summarized as follows they provide the analyst with advanced analytics algorithm and models they help the user to run on big data platforms such as hadoop or any highperformance analytic systems they helps the user to work not only with structured data but unstructured and semistructured data coming from multiple sources and its quite easy to visualize the analysed data in a form that helps in conveying the complex data insights in a pictorial way which is easy to understand by users big data tools help you to integrate with other technologies very
