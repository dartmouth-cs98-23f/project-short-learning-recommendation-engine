thank you very much fat yeah today im going to talk about computer graphics and visualization and basically it is an area that evolved quite drastically and nowadays we can computer generated or generate on a computer photorealistic imagery and even deal with very large scale data sets this open up many applications and various areas and this is also why its very exciting to work in this field because theres so many options on the table that are there to explore in this sense im also very happy to have a theme of different people behind me that will follow me in this endeavor at geo delta at the computer graphics and visualization group which im heading we are four faculty members in total 17 members 12 phd students 20 master students many other people that are involved in the projects im showing here today so the credit does not only go to me now what do we do in this group well we have basically four focus areas the first one is named technology geometry processing rendering techniques and medical or data visualization so in order to give you a glimpse of what these topics stand for i prepared a couple of examples to show you this little bit further game technology is about automatically generating content and this becomes more and more important at nowadays because we have procedurally generated worlds in which players or even people are trained and for that reason the content is not that easy to produce anymore because these worlds can be like gigantic contain many many people that are interacting with it and therefore procedural methods are key here we also developed an asst content design interfaces that allows people to very easily proceed you to generate content but just a few scribbles and therefore create entire 3d environments that can then be explored these environments there of course populated with geometry and it is one of the other topics that were looking at in detail how do we represent information how do we capture information from our surrounding how we transform that into a digital representation that then people can interact with here at the bottom youll also see an example of an animation and deformation algorithm so we also look at what are realistic deformations of objects in order to make them really reliable in the spiritual world one key example here is of course also how do i represent this information how do i represent the data and the information that is hidden in it in one direction that we recently took is to look at how we can represent for example performance capture where you had scanners that you could register this virtual character here and then basically decimate its information in such a way that we only extract the most valuable available information in other words we can go ahead and then basically transform a performance capture on the left with all the details into something that becomes more and more approximate and the user can control this level of detail automatically so the most important movements are captured which can then be used to query databases to transfer the motion on to other characters or to do another analysis steps in such a way you have really a system that allows you to then take any kind of moving input and represented with very few primitives that capture the entire information of this sequence now in these images you already see the next topic that we of course address in this group which is rendering techniques ultimately you want to show something on the screen which means that you have to transform this kind of virtual object into something that is displayable on your device were looking at realistic rendering including shadows shading global illumination nonphotorealistic rendering which is more for illustrative purposes or to explain things better the hd studies that show that with the right abstraction you can increase memorability as well as also reaction time of the people that are interacting with the data so it becomes very important to look at this different topic and automatically this links in with perception how do we perceive the images that we show how do we actually perceive animations or even interactive data evis trations and finally computational photography how do we integrate realworld data into our approaches in order to make them more accessible we can take this even further with more photorealistic landscapes in this case here you have even participating media which is fog and share it becomes very difficult to do on because light interaction happens in the entire scene and we need to compute all of these values in real time this becomes extremely important for example if you want to train people in a driving simulator or in plane simulator because all of a sudden you need to integrate all these weather effects in order to make the simulation reduces little world is represented well we heard this before data is exploding with information everywhere and dealing with largescale data sets is really a fundamental challenge that we need to address we look at topics like data analysis in order to get new insights of this information and produce representations that people can explore extract the knowledge that theyre actually looking for and then use the insides in their own applications in this sense let me show you a couple of different themes related to our data and medical visualization direction on largescale data display interaction methods visual analytics and medical visualization i think the key idea behind integrating the user and visualization techniques in big data is that if you look at a data development and recently used you have basically a development of compute power and data that before well behaved quite nicely right so we could basically deal with the data sets that we add at hand but this is about to change this means that the processing and analysis that we did before will not be sufficient anymore these two curves cross and we are basically out powered by the amount of data that is coming in consequently what we need is a new way to deal with data which means that you need to visualize it interact with and then guide what kind of data to keep what kind of data to involve in your processes and that means that the user has to be in the loop and we have visual beings so visualization is one of the key elements to have there to prove my point youre a very simple example this data set here if you look at it well its very different difficult to grasp what is shown here but in fact its just an app with different temperature levels and when i show you an image you immediately grasp what is going on you can see tendencies regions that are conformed so you get much better in size but this means that you need the right tools and the right solutions in order to make this really happen one domain that specifically key benefits from this is the medical domain here you can see a largescale medical skin usually these are in your order or a couple of gigabytes that are coming out of those machines and now you need to write technique in order to illustrate the outcome here at the lower left the video just shows an interaction with such a data set where you for example strip off the skin only look at the bones look at different organs and then really make decisions based on this input because of its large and huge amount of data we also looked at compression techniques meaning how can we actually reduce the retail level that is given in such box of representations for this tiny cube that has been measured the gcu seen that looks like a 3d environment that you might have seen from it thats a cheap video game but in fact this is made up of tiny little data cubes so we could also use the medical data set of a resolution that goes up to well i cannot pronounce the number and thats one of the things about numbers anymore but its 2 to the power 51 boxes that are represented here insect together and there may be compressed to do representation is only for gigabyte large so it fits evening on interactive graphics part where zooms also look in the upper right corner thats the resolution of the boxes that we are dealing with you so its really a gigantic environment represented in a very small amount of data and this reduction of information is also crucial when it comes to bandwidth and we have to transport the information to the graphics card or even to portable devices as was pointed out by gemach before and more and more things become mobile and we are looking at how can we deal with these largescale data sets everywhere now one of the directions that we explore this for example rendering where you basically can have access two gigabytes of data on the fly but just taking out your phone connecting to the right server in an interactivity you can see here in this video also that several people can interact at the same time the noise is due to the calculation of the kind of lighting that we use which in this case also includes a lot of sampling processes so dont get distracted by their in the video but the nice thing is that it basically if you have several doctors discussing the same day as they can interact they can do annotations one of them can change the way that the data is represented take off the ceiling again discuss with the colleagues places clipping plane and alton can come to a common conclusion now what i like other areas that benefit from largescale data representations when the netherlands one of the thats the fears that exists of course is fly that is always a big issue and so people have covered the entire netherlands with planes that have registered a height field of the entire country and if highfield already represents a terabyte of data and one of the goals is to compute simulations in this high field in order to predict what kind of safety measures have to be put into place in order to protect the people h terabytes means 50 meters of cds slows reading huge amount of data and if you want to integrate satellite data for example in order to find out something about 40 km i acquire year 1 point 5 petabytes of data and so its a huge amount a google earth already contains 21 petabytes of data today that is offered to you via disservice and now producing computations on a global scale like this is a big challenge you can show you a little bit of what you will also see in the class of how to produce a rendering systems live nation such gigantic data sets and information on the tribe because we needed we fly here from delta baby over to rubble and where will show you a quick application that we built in the context of this flood protection measurement one of the things that people look at it for example if you have a river like this what happens if the water rises and so you can place this inside of the simulation and you can synthetic which neighborhood where the water is flowing what safety procedures to follow in order to make sure that people get out without a problem it turns out on a side note it can actually in some areas mean that if there is a real flooding you should climb to the top of your roof top because theres no way that you could get over any three out of this area fast enough and these kind of insights are very available to decisionmakers in medical visualization it becomes a little less clear what the right recommendation and be two different presentations pictures for example i picked here a blood flow through this straightened we have the release scanners that are able to track what a flow of blood is inside of your body but they output these kind of images very hard for anybody that is not a domain expert so we also looked at ellis trations that are a little bit more understandable like each one feeling for of you where does the blood flow where they went vortices what is the direction and people that are using these kind of illustrative already found very nice finding that were previously unknown for example about certain locations in the heart and how they are turbulences that are related to rings us to a kind of loop what we want to do is we want to have the visualization and interaction with the user that can explore the data and find what theyre actually looking for now this is not always straightforward because this data analysis that over here cannot be done only when we want to support the human in this task and this is one of the research directions that includes visual analytics which at the moment is one other yeah lets say hot topic also in the area so what does it base or what is it based on well if we look at a high dimensional data set like this one here on the left you have the feeling okay it is threedimensional because all the points and three dimensions but it turns out that its actually in this case a folded piece of paper if you wonder so the data actually lives not in 3d it lives in 2d and if we can find out these kind of relationships we can reduce the dimensionality of available they mention that is intrinsically encoded so let me illustrate this with an example here is a data set where people have written numbers from 0 to 9 so everybody has a different handwriting so they dont match up but they collected 100 thousand samples and now this represents 4096 dimensions sounds a bit weird but that is the number of pixels that were used to scan it every bigfoot can change color so that gives you four thousand dimensions now what you can do is you can analyze this data set and actually embed it in a 2d representation what you get is something like this melody judy where the goal was to maintain as much as possible the neighborhood relationships between different objects meaning if theyre close now this is what it looks like and interestingly when you select a cluster like this one that is formed up here well it actually corresponds to certain elements in your data set so which means that this similarity can come out and become visually observable to the user unfortunately that is the downside well you can do this for all the numbers and look something like this and previous approaches have worked in the order of minutes for larger data sets in the order of hours which is very often unacceptable and undesirable so looking at like seller ation techniques like we did allows you to go down to timing we get similar results of these types of embeddings that allowed the interactions without having to wait for it for a long time now furthermore when you look at data like this you see okay similar information but you dont get a overview of what number is might be linked of what things might be very similar is seven looks a lot like a one is there a way to abstract is even further and create groups that are meaningfully connected so this is also direction as we looked into of how to create her ocular representations and for this i will change the example because its a little bit better to feel where settle as its like different spectral responses of the ground and we analyze these data sets to then define is embedding point spread out here not also high dimensional corresponding to different spectral bands that have been covered and then the user can select certain groups that then reflect properties this is not something we put in it is something that came out of the embedding in other words if you select the other clusters that you see there in this image it represents clouds ocean because on a high level while the ground is ground the clouds are clouds and the sea you see now if you take only the mainland you can do the same event embedding again and you see desert areas form mountains urban areas and for this particular case if you continue with the desert areas you find dry legs and a particular one off the dry lights that is the largest one also sticks out so you can see how you can dive into the data representation and find what youre actually looking for it would have been impossible to find this driving just tiny in comparison to all the other information it is there but if you know what youre looking for these kind of systems allow you to find the information you need now finding information also means the user is integrated in this process so if we also looked extensively at tools that would allow you to interact with a computer that you can see for example gesture control that is to modify a 3d object here in this case in particular this application is funny because seeing that you dont touch anything with your hands it also means that a surgeon with in surgery can stay sarah they can actually interact with medical data set without contaminating themselves if you construction simplification animation theres data display largescale realistic rendering illustrative rendering perceptual methods also new display technology and data visualization and interaction which is the main specific visualization visual analytics and interaction methods so the course is afternoon were going to cover many of these different directions im going to give you insights and how they actually work so that you can then pick up the information that you might need for your own projects and then also get in touch with us if you are further interested this thank you very much get there
