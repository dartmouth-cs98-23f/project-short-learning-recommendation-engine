north american lead here at ibm quantum and today were going to be talking about how to best increase your chances of getting an internship at ibm quantum or any other quantum computing company so the complaint i hear most from applicants every season is how hard it is to get an interview so were going to focus on the getting to the interview stage of your application for internships because once our applicants get interviews they actually do quite well so in order to get your application and your resume in front of a hiring manager im going to give you some some specific tips so first thing to know is here at ibm quantum we have one of the biggest internship opportunities out of any quantum computing company we host over a hundred interns every summer and im happy to say that this year we have already launched our internship applications for our 2023 internship season so we have three specific applications that i want to talk about today we have the hardware internships the software internships and then the research internships and every single category that im listing here has their own job recommendation so the hardware internships are pretty selfexplanatory if you want to work in sort of like an engineering role get your hands dirty with some of the hardware thats the job for you if youre interested in software applications or working on any layer of the quantum computing stack or even theory the software application wreck is for you and if you have experience doing research if youre a graduate student and you want to know what research is like in a more industrial setting the research recommendation is what youre probably going to be looking at so with these three applications we get lots of applicants every single year and it can be really really hard to know which applicants are going to be the best fit for every single role so here at ibm it works like this you apply to a specific category one of the three that i just listed here and then your application and your resume gets put into a pool and hiring managers have access to everybody in the pool and so theyre going to be looking for people whose qualifications match specific skills needed for the job that theyre looking to hire for that summer so you want to make your application as specific as possible and its totally okay to apply to more than one of these positions but one thing i will caution you on is you really need to tailor your resume to each specific job wreck that youre applying to so if you might be interested in hardware and software and youre not really sure which one would be more fun you do need to write different applications you need to have a resume that lists your hardware experience more prominently than maybe your software experience and then you need to have another which really digs into your software experience maybe over your hardware experience assuming you have both one other question people have is when should i apply to a quantum computing internship a lot of people think that they need to wait until they are further along in their education and maybe working towards a graduate degree to even have a good chance of applying but thats not actually true as you can see from this graph here our internships are pretty split down the middle in terms of people that we hire who are working towards their bachelor degree and people that we hire who are working towards a graduate degree and its split at about 48 percent undergrads about 15 percent masters students and about 46 phds equating to about uh 36 percent people who are working towards their doctorate degree and this is just data from last year so i would say apply as soon as you are interested and as soon as you have relevant experience towards the job that you are looking to attain so once people are accepted into one of these three programs you can see here we have a list of specific projects that people worked on last year in software and a specific list that people worked on here last year in hardware so if any of these apply to you i definitely encourage you to apply so as i was saying its really important to make your application as specific as possible because youre not applying to a specific team youre applying to be as part of a pool as part of a category and then hiring managers have to select you out of that pool and figure out which skill set is best for the project that they want you to work on you should really be as specific as possible so for instance one thing that i see a lot is people who are really general resumes and they say you know i just i love quantum computing i would do anything to work in quantum computing im interested in all aspects of it which is its great to hear that but it makes it really really hard to know what to hire you for because we dont actually see any specific direction or any specific passion so we need to know what specific aspects are most appealing to you and sometimes i sympathize and it can be really hard to choose theres a lot of interesting aspects of quantum computing but if you can just pick one or two and put at the top of your application or at the top of your cv hi im so and so and i am looking to apply to a position doing x y and z based on my specific experience in x y and z thats going to increase your chances of sticking out to a hiring manager and letting them know oh this person has a direction and they have a specific skill which lends itself towards me and my project another thing that i always tell people is helpful to do is to get a referral but i think what people sort of misconstrue with that notion is that they should reach out to anybody at the company and ask for a general referral without really knowing them and this is actually not helpful because if a person who you know works on the software side is asked for a referral and they they want to you know help you out and they give you a referral but youre interested in a hardware position that referral doesnt really mean anything because that person doesnt really know the project youre going to be working on what i would recommend doing instead of just reaching out to people at the company if you dont really know what they work on is to find specific people who are working in an area that youre interested in and say hi you know my name is abc i am really interested in the work that youve done be specific tell them the work that theyve done that youre interested in and say you know i have a specific skill do you think theres a fit for me on your team this year dont just come out and ask for a referral i would say am i am i a good fit for you do i have relevant skills do you have any openings on your team this year this is all going to lend itself much more organically to helping you get your foot in the door all right so lastly i want to list some really specific things that hiring managers have told me that they have been looking for in the past so you can know the level of detail that you should be looking to put on your cv now dont write these sentences down exactly these are just examples of things that people were looking for last year so you can know how people are going to be viewing your resume so for instance a hardware manager told me that they are looking for people who have specific e m rf and microwave experience along with basic or even quantum mechanics experience they also need to have handson experience with connectors power and mechanical design and its also desirable to have software development skills for automation purposes on the other hand a software hiring manager told me that you know we hire people all along the stack of quantum computing software so the specific languages that they might be looking for you to have experience in really depend on what part of the stack you want to look at look at and work on either at the front end the back end part of development but some of the languages that we look for specifically this is not all inclusive but as an example um are people who have experience with languages like c rust pi torch sql pandas and kiske in addition software development hiring managers look for you to be able to demonstrate that you care about clean code principles and are able to work on technical projects in a really collaborative team environment so those are the tips that i have for you right now i hope that some of these have helped you gleam what might help you get your foot in the door and secure an internship for next summer if you have any other questions feel free to ask them in the comments below and good luck with the 2023 internship hiring season everybody music
