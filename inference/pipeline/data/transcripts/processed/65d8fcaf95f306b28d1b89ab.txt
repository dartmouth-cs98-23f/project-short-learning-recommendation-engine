so much fast they had students and researchers and the things you teach are pragmatically minded i practically minded freaking figuring out ways how to solve real problems and fast right so from your experience whats the difference between theory and practice of deep learning well most of the research in the deep mining world is a total waste of time all right that i was getting it yeah its its a problem in science in general scientists need to be published which means they need to work on things that their peers are extremely familiar with and can recognize in advance in that area so that means that they all need to work on the same thing and so it really inc and and the thing they work on theres nothing to encourage them to work on things that are practically useful so you get just a whole lot of research which is minor advances and stuff thats been very highly studied and has no significant practical impact whereas the things that really make a difference like i mentioned transfer learning like if we can do better at transfer learning then its this like worldchanging thing were suddenly like lots more people can do worldclass work with less resources and less data and but almost nobody works on that or another example active learning which is the study of like how do we get more out of the human beings in the loop wheres my favorite homage yeah so active learning is great but its almost nobody working on it because its just not a trendy thing right now you know what somebodys suicide interrupt youre saying that nobody is publishing an active learning but theres people inside companies anybody who actually has to solve a problem theyre going to innovate an active learning yeah everybody kind of reinvents active learning when they actually have to work in practice because they start labeling things and they think gosh this is taking a long time and its very expensive and then they start thinking well why am i labeling everything im own the machines only making mistakes on those two classes theyre the hard ones maybe you ought to start labeling those two classes and then you start thinking well why did i do that manually why cant i just get the system to tell me which things are going to be hardest its an obvious thing to do but yeah its its just like like transplant learning its its under studied and the academic world just has no reason to care about practical results the funny thing is like ive only really ever written one paper i hate writing papers and i didnt even write it it was my colleague sebastian ruder who actually wrote it i just did the research for it but it was basically introducing transfer learning successful transfer learning to nlp for the first time the algorithm is called glm fit and it actually i actually wrote it for the course for the first day of course i wanted to teach people in lp and i thought i only want to teach people practical stuff and i think the only practical stuff is transfer learning and i couldnt find any examples of transfer learning and nlp so i just did it and i was shocked to find that as soon as i did it was you know the basic prototype took a couple of days smashed the stateoftheart on one of the most important data sets in a field that i knew nothing about and i just thought well this is ridiculous and so i spoke to the best unit and he kindly offered to write it up the results and so it ended up being published in a cl which is the top link with computational linguistics conference so like people do actually care once you do it but i guess its difficult for maybe like junior researchers or like like i dont care whether i get citations or papers whatever i was right theres nothing in my life that makes that important which is why ive never actually bothered to write a pic of myself now for people who do i guess they have to pick the kind of safe option which is like yeah make a slight improvement on something that everybody is already working on you
