changed virtually every aspect of our life well the arrival of quantum computers could be even more historic than that were now in the initial stages of the next revolution were talking about a new generation of computers the ultimate computer a computer that computes on atoms the ultimate constituents of matter itself the question is whos involved in this race to perfect quantum computers and the answer is everyone all the big players are part of this race because if theyre not silicon valley could become the next rust belt also anyone whos interested in security is interested in quantum computers they can crack almost any code that is based on digital technology thats why the fbi the cia and all national governments are following this very closely quantum computers will change everything the economy how we solve problems the way we interact with the universe you name it quantum computers will be there im dr michio kaku professor of theoretical physics at the city university of new york and author of quantum supremacy about the rise of quantum computers you see computers have gone through three basic stages stage one was the analog computer so 2000 years ago there was a shipwreck and in the boat that sank was a device and when you brushed away the dirt and debris you began to realize that it was a machine a machine of incredible complexity it was in fact the worlds first analog computer and it was designed to map the motion of the moon the sun and the planets to simulate the universe but as we primitive peoples became more prosperous we had to count things count how many cows you had count how much profit you made analog computers could be based on sticks bones whatever it took to count so this went on for thousands of years until finally we reached the work of charles babbage he creates the ultimate analog computer with hundreds of gears and levers and pulleys and by turning the crank you could then calculate longitude latitude you could calculate interest rates it was very valuable to have an instrument like that for the banking industry for commerce then world war ii comes along babbages machine is simply too primitive to break the german code so the job was given to mathematicians like alan turing alan turing was the one who codified a lot of the laws of computation into what is called and of course its digital now the digital revolution is based on transistors it operates on zeros and ones zeros and ones at the speed of electricity every digital computer is a turing machine the next step beyond digital computers is the quantum era richard feynman was one of the founders of quantum electrodynamics but also a visionary and he asked himself a simple question how small can you make a transistor and he realized that the ultimate transistor is an atom one atom that could control the flow of electricity not just on or off but everything inbetween we have to go to quantum computers computers that compute on atoms rather than on transistors transistors are based on zeros and one zeros and one reality is not reality is based on electrons and particles and these particles in turn act like waves so you have to have a new set of mathematics to discuss the waves that make up a molecule and thats where quantum computers come in theyre based on electrons and these electrons how come they have so much computational power because they could be in two places at the same time thats what gives quantum computers their power they compute on not just one universe but an infinite number of parallel universes at the fundamental level quantum mechanics can be reduced down to a cat schrodingers cat lets take a box in the box you put a cat and the question is is the cat dead or alive well until you open the box you dont know it is alive and dead simultaneously its in a superposition of two states in other words the universe has split in half in one half the cat is alive in the other universe the cat is dead thats the basis of the quantum theory that until you make a measurement the cat can exist in both states simultaneously in fact in any number of states simultaneously the cat could be dead alive playing jumping sideways sick any number of states now why am i mentioning this cause this summarizes the power of quantum computers quantum computers compute on parallel universes thats why they are so powerful so how much faster is a quantum computer over a digital computer in principle when we talk about digital computers we can measure their power in terms of bits for example spin up spin down zeros and one would constitute one bit for a large digital computer were now talking about billions of bits that are modeled by transistors except now quantum computers talk not just about spin up or spin down but everything in between thats called a qubit one qubit represents all the possibilities of an object spinning between up and down thousands of qubits can now be modeled with the latest generation of quantum computers eventually we hope to hit a million and so were talking about exceeding the power of ordinary digital computers it is the point at which a quantum computer can outrace and outperform a digital computer on a certain task we passed that several years ago but we want a machine that could exceed the power of any digital computer were not there yet but were very close to it the number one problem facing quantum computers is the question of decoherence everything is based on particles like electrons and electrons have waves associated with them when these waves are vibrating in unison its called coherence and then you can do calculations of a quantum mechanical nature but if you fall out of coherence then everything vibrates at a different frequency and what is that called noise you have to reduce the temperature down to near absolute zero so everything is pretty much vibrating slowly in unison thats difficult now nature solves this problem it is the basis of all life on the earth photosynthesis for example is a quantum mechanical process mother nature can create coherence at room temperature amazing mother nature is still smarter than us when it comes to the quantum theory so lets face it there are hurdles affecting the growth of quantum computers but they pale in comparison to the benefits that may be unleashed by quantum computers were talking about opening the floodgates take a look for example of food supply the green revolution that allows us to feed the population of the world is slowly coming to an end were trying to use quantum computers to unlock the secret of how to make fertilizer from nitrogen take a look at energy quantum computers may be able to create fusion power by stabilizing the super hot hydrogen inside a fusion reactor and take a look at medicine you realize that life is based on molecules molecules that can create alzheimers disease parkinsons disease cancer these diseases are beyond the reach of digital computers but hey this is what quantum computers do well be able to model diseases at the molecular level and thats why we hope to cure the incurable using quantum computers were talking about turning medicine upside down my personal hope for quantum computers is that well be able to create a theory of the entire universe the theory that eluded einstein the theory that would explain black holes and supernovas and galactic evolution but the equations are so complex that no one no one has been able to solve them perhaps theyll be solved in the memory of a quantum computer
