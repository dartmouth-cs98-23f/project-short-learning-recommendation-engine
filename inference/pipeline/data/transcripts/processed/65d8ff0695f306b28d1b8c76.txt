computer its the machine that can solve problems that are completely intractable by any modern computer no matter how powerful but to really outperform a supercomputer the quantum computer must be built using many quantum bits or qubits all individually controlled and coupled to each other in a larger array our team at unsw has already established the record of performance for single qubits in the solid state ill cubital individual atoms of phosphorous implanted inside a silicon chip very similar to those that power all modern computers and smartphones weve made qubits out of both the electron and the nucleus of the phosphorus atom but because they are atomic size systems you would normally need to place them a few atoms apart so that the electrons touch each other to perform quantum calculations we have now discovered that this is not necessary we can make the phosphorus qubits talk to each other over much larger distances at one condition that we encode quantum information in the combined state of the electron and the nucleus for example we encode a zero in the electron down nucleus at combination and a one in the electron up nucleus down we called it the flipflop qubit it is operated by pulling the electron away from the nucleus and then oscillating the electron position around its equilibrium point this means that we can now control a qubit in silicon using electric instead of magnetic signals this makes it much easier to integrate with normal electronic circuits and once negative charge of the electron is pulled away from the positive charge of the nucleus the qubit creates an electric field that reaches over large distances so we can now design a largescale quantum computer where there is plenty of space to insert interconnects control lines and read out devices without having to fabricate components at the scale of a few atoms this is a major shift in the way we can build silicon quantum computers using flipflop qubits instead of normal qubits will allow us to manufacture large arrays of qubits without having to push the limits of fabrication of conventional electronic devices so its a quicker and more economical way to build a quantum computer that is big enough to start having an impact in the world
