it’s just a bunch of boxes prisms and spheres and cylinders and things like that”  it’s limitless i mean you just use your imagination to create up whatever you you feel like and you’re not really limited by the software either  you can go into movies video games pretty much anything that involves computers and visual elements to it you can go on into so many different things with this degree that’s what makes it so great  in the world of technology we need to not be preparing for the jobs today we need to be prepared for the jobs two years three years a little ways down the road and also give students a firm foundation if they’re going to not only going to get a job but have a career through their lifetime they need to have a certain foundation of fundamental skills so we’re looking at our kind of standard graphics classes like photoshop and illustrator but then we also integrated a lot of the newer things of digital video digital sound animation we have classes in 3ds using automax  i chose saint paul college because they have the best technical programs around they have computers available for students to use to do their homework and create awesome things  one of the great attributes i think of saint paul college is we’re very focused on student placement so we have an internship program that’s very vibrant and we also focus on a portfolio class which at the end of their college career prepares them to go out in the workforce and also prepares them for some of the skills they’ll need throughout their career  what stands out most about the teachers to me is their enthusiasm they’re always so ready and willing to give you all their experiences experiences that they’ve had so you learn a lot from what they’ve learned but if you like the idea of how technology is constantly changing this is definitely the career field for you music outro
