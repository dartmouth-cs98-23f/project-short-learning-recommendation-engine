algorithm if you look at standard definitions of these terms its easy to think that they are super complicated concepts how do we really interpret these definitions i like to think about data structures and algorithms using the following analogy lets say youve been buying a few books recently right now you have a pretty simple organization scheme as soon as you get a book you stack it on top of the last book this ingenious organization scheme has been patented by college students all over the world and has proved to be highly effective now lets say you want to find a specific book from this stack how would you do it the most straightforward way to find a book is by taking a book off the stack until you find the book that youre looking for i know what youre thinking what does this have to do with data structures and algorithms but believe it or not you just saw a textbook example of a data structure and an algorithm in this example you can think of a data structure as our stack of books and the algorithm we use to find a book is the process of taking books off the top of the stack until we find the book that we are looking for but as time goes on and you start getting a lot of books you decide to become a little bit more organized you decide to buy a bookshelf and put all your books in alphabetical order by the authors what do we do now if we want to find a book you probably would start in the middle and slowly hone in to the appropriate place of the book based on the order of the alphabet here the data structure would be the bookshelf organized alphabetically and your algorithm would be your search process now lets say as you get even more books you decide to change your organization scheme one more time you now basically have a small library and each self is split based on fiction or nonfiction and then the respective genre within each genre you keep the same alphabetical organization of authors and now if you want to find a book you can narrow your search to the corresponding section here your data structure is this hierarchical organization of books based on genre and your algorithm is the process by which you identified the genre and then found your book so taking a step away from this analogy i think a really simple way to think about data structures and algorithms is the following the data structure is a way to organize information and an algorithm is a way to process information to reach an end goal some of the ways of organizing and using information are not at all obvious but they all have their strengths and weaknesses and a lot of the subject is about understanding these tradeoffs in the following videos ill introduce some fundamental data structures talk about how you would go about designing them and then talk about their performance after we get through some key data structures well get into some important algorithms they use these data structures to solve a variety of problems if you enjoyed this video i really appreciate it if you took a moment to like the video and subscribe to get notified when future videos come out if you would like to support this channel check out the patreon page linked in the description thanks for watching and ill see you in the next video
