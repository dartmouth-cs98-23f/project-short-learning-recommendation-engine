potential to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers but which problems can they solve exponentially faster and which problems would we do just as well to solve using a classical computer so these are the questions that were really interested in as quantum algorithms researchers now to set the stage it makes sense to talk a little bit about the relationship between algorithms and computer hardware more generally a computer is a programmable machine which obeys the laws of physics an algorithm is a recipe for solving a problem so an algorithm is a sequence of steps that leads you to the solution of course if you design an algorithm you have to make sure that the machine you plan to run it on can execute each of those steps generally speaking this is not much of a problem because algorithms designers like to abstract away the machine and work using a basic instruction set that can then be mapped to the machine afterwards and one of the central principles of theoretical computer science is that if you use the right basic instruction set then any realworld machine you could build you can run that algorithm on it this central tenets of theoretical computer science held up for about 50 years but we now understand that theres one exception to this rule and the exception is quantum computers quantum computers use a fundamentally different instruction set than classical computers as a result they can run different algorithms algorithms you could not run on classical computers those algorithms make use of quantum effects like nonlocality entanglement superposition and interference and so when youre designing a quantum algorithm your aim is to exploit those quantum effects to make you get the solution faster generally speaking an algorithm might start by taking your classical input to the problem processing that into a quantum state which is a superposition of an exponential number of classical states you then aim to transform that quantum state which encodes the problem into a quantum state which encodes the solution and from that quantum state you measure and you get the solution now of course to make this work its a bit of an art and you have to design an algorithm which follows these these steps for a given problem and some of the areas where we have such algorithms where we have quantum speedups include the simulation of quantum systems number theoretic problems like integer factorization and certain types of search problems now one of the caveats is that most of these algorithms are designed for future quantum computers which have many many cubans and right now were at a moment where people are building small and modest size quantum computers and so its an exciting research area to understand what can we do with those devices before we have basically an unlimited number of qubits
