in this video we are going to discuss neural networks neural networks is one of the most important topics in artificial intelligence this is important because most of the research this is one of the most preferable topics in the research area secondly there are so many applications that we use on a daily basis and the neural network is somehow working under them for example google translate and google assistant neural network plays a vital role in them i have written the name of the topic as neural networks  artificial neural networks lets start with neural networks what are neural networks the word neural is referred to neurons and network means obviously the neurons are connected to each other for example the internet on the internet all the pcs mobiles and all these are interconnected and what do they actually do sharing of information sharing of data we are doing the same here the neurons inside the human brain we are talking about the human brain inside the human brain there are gazillions of neurons there is a very high number of neurons all those neurons are interconnected with a network that connectivity helps them flow information and data and process it and in parallel processing and obviously they pass the data in very less time and generate the output in the same human brain that works like this learning algorithms play a vital role in the human brain the human brain can learn from experiences and train data in itself the capacity of training and learning makes the human brain a very important organ what we are doing here is that we want to build machines in the artificial neural network we want to implement the same thing as how the human brain works we call it an artificial neural network obviously there will be no biological neurons like our brains but there will be artificial neurons those will be connected through a network as the neurons in our brains are connected they will also learn train the data and obviously try to generate better output the basic aim of neural networks in artificial intelligence if anybody asks you what a neural network is and what its basic aim is its main aim is to copy the human brain as it is in the machines and make them learn from their experience we are implementing the same thing here i want to tell you the next point that we already have computers supercomputers and highcomputational devices available which can do parallel processing then how are they different from neural networks i want to explain it to you with a simple example the computers that are already available to us if we check 8 raised to the power 8 in that it will generate the output in very less time but the human brain will definitely take some extra time to calculate this the human brain is a little less efficient but from the point of view of computation and calculations the computers are performing so well what are the areas where normal computers will not perform well i want to explain it to you with a simple example lets say its your first day at the office you met so many people there you recognized their faces when you will again go to the office the next day your brain will detect and recognize those faces so many people may have shaved or trimmed their appearance may have been changed a little but you will recognize them the human brain learns and trains if we want to do the same thing on a normal computer it will have to do all the scanning if there are 100 people you will have to scan them first you will have to scan their photos and give them to the computer if you check again the next day if you make any changes to the photo like they shaved their beard or grew their mustache the normal computer will not recognize even if it does so its performance and output will not be 100 accurate its accuracy will lie somewhere between a maximum of 4050 thats an inaccurate system i am telling the same here we use algorithms and programs on the input data and find out a meaningful output a normal computer does this but now we have implemented the neural networks now the neural networks will improve learn and train like the brain does i want to tell another simple example nowadays the avengers movie is trending there is a character of iron man or tony stark in that if i show you any photo of tony stark if i show any of his photos to the human brain in which there is a long beard or mustache or he is wearing the mask of iron man or he is making any facial expressions you will recognize him immediately why because the human brain trains everything as soon as he tilted his face our human brain will train learn and recognize tony stark but if you want to do the same with a normal computer in which there is no neural network it cannot do this properly because you will have to feed all the facial expressions that he is making it generates the output on the basis of what you feed to it whatever output it will generate will not be so accurate it obviously tries to implement classification but that will not be completely accurate as he will make a new expression the computer will not recognize it or it will say that it matches 2030 with tony stark but if you implement the same with a neural network then it will recognize tony stark 95 here the accuracy is increasing learning by itself is the power of neural networks we talk about learning algorithms in neural networks these learning algorithms are the power of neural networks this happens inside our brains we want to implement the same in the neural network too you must have seen some ads too alia bhatt did an ad in which there was something written in chinese on her friends tshirt she asks what it meant he says something related to samurai philosophy but as soon as she checked it on google translate it generated the output immediately it means that the data of google is already trained it trains even more data and learning algorithms work there as you give it some data it will convert the input into some meaningful data then it will use the neural network on it and try to learn and improve i have created a small example of biological neurons in biological neurons we have dendrites dendrites fetch the input they receive the input then we have the cell body which is used for processing then there are axoms through which the data is passed these are the terminal axoms they will connect to the next dendrites further we use so many keywords here we are implementing this biological neuron in the machine with artificial neuron here x1 x2 and up to xn are the inputs there are some associated waits on the basis of that we are applying mathematical functions like here sigma i am using submission here in submission if i am using the linear function the linear functions is x1 w1 i may use the sigmoid function i may also use a different quadratic function these mathematical functions try to generate some output then we compare that output with the threshold values that whether the value is accurate or not what we do in the artificial neural network its base is the biological neuron the base of neural networks of artificial intelligence is that how the brain works and we want to implement the same in the machine if we check on google assistant if you ask google assistant whats the timing of avengers it will pick the keywords means timing avengers and it will show you which timings are available at the nearest multiplexes what i mean to say is that here its learning it tries to use keywords to generate an accurate output we have so many different architectures in neural networks we have singlelayer multilayer recurrent etc we will discuss them next and how our functions work and how we change the waits initially we may assign any random waits to the inputs but how we train these waits how we make them accurate we will see that in further videos this is a basic introduction to neural networks about what neural networks are and how we use them thank you
