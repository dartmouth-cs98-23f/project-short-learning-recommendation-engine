to another video today we are gonna be comparing python versus r were gonna see which one is better music now before i start this presentation yes i made an entire presentation for this video i have to address the elephant in the room about a month ago i made a somewhat controversial post i dont think its controversial some people did apparently um and its right here hopefully on your screen at this time all it says is python is better than r thats my opinion but it stirred up a lot of emotions for a lot of people a lot of people messaged me commented on it and apparently a lot of people took offense to what i said and they wanted me to explain why i felt this way and i did not respond for the pure fact that it was more fun to watch them argue and complain rather than answer their question but also i knew i was going to be making this video anyways and so i just figured they could watch this video whenever i put it out which uh is right now and so if you are only on linkedin and youve never watched my channel before and you are just seeing for this for the first time and you remember that time when i posted it i hope this will be clarifying for you um and so without further ado lets get into the presentation uh and we will start from there all right so some of the things that were going to be discussing today in our python versus our presentation is were going to talk about descriptions different libraries the code syntax pros and cons of both and my final answer uh i will say before we get into it im not trying to go super in depth uh i i tried to make it as userfriendly as possible if you know you guys are really wanting a more indepth presentation on just one of these i can absolutely do that i plan on doing that at some point but this is going to be kind of high level and more talking about my thoughts and my feelings regarding this because it is a very emotional thing i believe without further ado lets get into the description of both again keeping it more high level and kind of getting to some specifics and then my conclusion so lets look at the description of both python and r starting with r r is a programming language developed for statistical analysis and the people who mostly used it for a long long time where statisticians and just recently within the past you know five ten years has really been used for data science and data analysis and visualizations and all of those things it was developed in 1993 again like i just said primarily for statisticians data miners and analysts and its used by a ton of very large companies some of them are uber facebook and google but there are tons of companies and even small companies that use r and so if your company does any type of statistics or statistical analysis theres a good chance that your company has either used r in the past or is currently using r as a programming language now onto python python is a general purpose programming language its used for almost anything you can imagine it may not be the best thing for every single thing it can do but it can do almost anything and so its very general very broad it is quickly becoming the most popular programming language in the world and it is used by companies like google facebook and netflix now if you notice in the companies that use python and are both facebook and google are on that list then that wasnt by accident i did that on purpose because i wanted to show that these companies large companies are going to use both programming languages for what theyre good for which obviously we will talk about later but i wanted to just kind of put that there for um i guess foreshadowing now before we look at libraries and packages i just want to say that if i did not highlight your favorite library or package on here i am sorry there are so many especially with r theres just hundreds and thousands of different packages and libraries uh i just cant possibly put them all on here and so these are just a highlight of some of the more popular ones the ones that i have personally used and so i hope that you are not offended by that but lets start with r for data collection you can use things like our crawler read excel read rl and r curl for data wrangling exploration theres dplyr sql df datatable read r and tidyr and for data visualization theres ggplot2 ggviz plotly squis and shiny and over to python for a data collection theres pandas requests and beautiful soup for data wrangling and exploration theres pandas numpy and scipy and for data visualization there is matplotlib seaborn and plotly again this is just a high level overview of some of the packages in each of these programming languages if you have never used r or python i think these packages are a really good place to start now for the code and the syntax on both of these i tried to stay neutral on this i tried to just kind of say what everyone else was saying because i have my own very strong thoughts and opinions on this uh but you know i wanted to stay somewhat unbiased at least for this one um but for r its easy medium difficulty to pick up and start working from from scratch you know if youve never picked up r it can be kind of difficult to pick up um a little bit more advanced it can be difficult to maintain your code especially as you start to scale your code and so that is a big problem that a lot of people have addressed or talked about with r with python again its easy medium difficulty to pick up and learn i i think it can be about the same difficulty as r in my opinion and thats what a lot of people said and so thats not just my opinion but its easier to write and maintain larger scale code and so as you start building larger projects or join larger teams or take on more data its just easier to scale up now into some syntax examples i 100 cherry pick these but i do feel like theyre pretty representative of what the code looks like as a whole and so a lot of people are probably gonna get mad at me saying no r is much easier than this and you may be right in some aspects but for the most part i feel like this is fairly accurate were just reading in a csv file and then trying to find the mean on a column or a field and thats about it and as you can tell r is just a little bit more difficult a little bit more complicated pythons a little bit more cleaner its a little bit more easy to read and pick up and thats something that a lot of people say about python its very easily readable now lets look at some of the pros and cons of both were going to be starting with r some of the pros are that it is open source it is fantastic for statistical analysis has hundreds of packages and libraries purely for analytics and thats what r is its purely for statistics and analyzing data and lastly it is easy to build visualizations with r now for the cons it cant be embedded in web applications and from what ive read thats purely for security reasons and so that is a big downside of using r you need to know a large amount of packages and libraries you cant just know like one or two kind of like in python you can know pandas and you can do a lot of different things with it r doesnt really have that you have to know several things in order to get kind of one task done and lastly r can run slow because of how they store their data so those are some of the pros and the cons of r now lets move on to python some of the pros for python its open source its easy to read and learn especially if youre just picking it up for the first time it can be embedded into web applications which can be very important for a lot of people and theres a growing number of libraries for data analysis there are of course growing number of of libraries and packages for r as well but those are quite more well established while python is still growing and theyre coming out and theyre catching up to r fairly quickly for the cons the processing speed can be slow especially depending on what library or package youre using but you know i think thats a con in both r and python on some level theyre going to run slow it uses a large amount of memory kind of part of the why its running slow its simple to learn um and simple to use and sometimes thats an issue actually because its so simple when you need to do really complicated things it can be kind of hard to do where an r thats what its built for its made for those complex calculations and so thats why those packages and libraries are built the way they are and lastly the libraries for all analytics needs are still being developed and so yes it is a pro that those numbers are growing uh but its still a con that theyre you know behind our and so r has more being developed and more already developed in terms of all their libraries and packages being built out or python it is still growing now on to my final answer which is better python or r it really depends um but going back to my linkedin post that we talked about the very beginning i will say that i still 100 believe that because to me for my type of work the stuff that i do python is 100 times better its 100 times more useful and so to me python is better than r but it really does depend on what youre using it for and so if youre doing purely statistical work r is going to be the better choice if youre doing machine learning python is arguably much better in my opinion r is harder to learn but it has more features while python is easier to learn but isnt as developed yet and so what i genuinely think you should do is i think you should try both i think you really need to get some handson experience take a course in both just see what you think and and determine for yourself what you think is better i really will go back to that linkedin for a second i believe that for me personally python is just better i can use it for so many things it is in my opinion much better suited for me and what i do for my job and so for me python is way better but for other positions and other people are maybe the programming language of choice and im totally okay with that there were a lot of people in the comments who were writing you know it just depends and and you know why dont you think that one why do you think that one is better than the other you know why cant it be both and i really wanted to respond and be like i agree with you uh but i didnt because again i thought it was more fun and i knew i was making this video and so i i genuinely in the bottom of my heart to all those people i agree with you and so i want you to feel some vindication some sense of you know you you you were right and so i hope that this was um hopefully a good outcome for what youre hoping for uh i have nothing against r i have used it um and i and ive taken a few courses on it um i have not used that much art in my actual job although the data scientists that are in my department use it quite a bit i mostly stick with python and so again thats why i like it better but i can honestly say that ive given both a fair chance and so i think that you should do the same i think you really should test out which one that you personally think is better thank you guys so much for watching i really appreciate it if you like this video be sure to like and subscribe i feel like its worth subscribing to i got some pretty good videos i got a lot of videos coming out soon thank you for joining me and i will see you in the next video music you
