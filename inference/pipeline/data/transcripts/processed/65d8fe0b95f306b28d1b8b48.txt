same thing well you may have seen these terms   used interchangeably but if im mining data from  a large dataset am i performing data science or   am i performing data analytics or what if im  trying to create a prediction of when my store   will sell out of our current inventory of  cantaloupes well is that analytics or is   that science its worthwhile to understand the  difference to better comprehend what these two   fields can do and also if youre considering  a career in either field after all these are two   different jobs somebody who works in the field  of data science is known as a data scientist   for data analytics that role is called a data  analyst now this is kind of a trick question   because we can classify everything data  mining data forecasting and all the rest of   it as simply data science and thats because  data science is the overarching umbrella term   that covers tasks related to finding patterns in  large datasets training machine learning models   and deploying ai applications data analytics it  could be argued is one task that resides under   the data science umbrella its a specialization  of data science and it focuses on querying   interpreting and visualizing datasets data  science is iterative meaning data scientists form   hypotheses and experiments to see if a desired  outcome can be achieved using available data   and that is a process that is known as the data  science lifecycle which usually follows seven   phases so first is to identify a problem or an  opportunity then the next phase is data mining   which is to extract data relevant to that problem  or opportunity from large datasets now that data   will likely consist of a bunch of redundancies  and errors which is fixed in the next stage   data cleaning and then at that point we move on  to data exploration analysis to try to make sense   of that data well then apply feature engineering  using domain knowledge to extract details from the   data and predictive modeling comes next to use  the data to predict or forecast future outcomes   and behaviors and then finally we have data  visualization that represents the data points with   graphical tools such as charts and animations  and so the lifecycle repeats now the role of a   data scientist is an indemand profession right  now if thats something youre interested in   youll want to develop deep skills in machine  learning and ai its helpful to be able to   write code in languages such as pythonalso in r  its another popular language for data science and   you should have experience working with big data  platforms so perhaps hadoop or apache spark and   its also very helpful to have database knowledge  and sql so thats data science but what about   its specialization data analytics well the job  of a data analyst is to conceptualize a data set   as it currently exists so we have some data  here and we need to do something with it and   we need to be able to make decisions based on  this data how do we conceptualize it well   four ways one is through predictive analytics  which helps to identify trends correlations and   causation within datasets like forecasting when  those cantaloupes would have all flown off the   shelves or in health care to forecast regions  which will experience a rise in flu cases theres   prescriptive analytics and that predicts likely  outcomes and makes decision recommendations like   predicting when a tire will wear out and need  to be replaced theres diagnostic analytics   that helps pinpoint the reason an event occurred  manufacturers can analyze a failed component on an   assembly line and figure out the reason behind its  failure and then there is descriptive analytics   which evaluates the qualities and quantities of  a data set a content streaming provider might   use descriptive analytics to understand how many  subscribers its lost or how many its gained over   a given period of time and what content is being  watched and while a data scientist is a clearly   defined and specialized role virtually any  stakeholder can be a data analyst for example   business analysts can use bi dashboards to conduct  business analytics and visualize kpis but many   organizations do employ professional dedicated  data analysts responsible for data wrangling   and interpreting findings like why a companys  marketing campaign didnt meet expectations if   you want to be a data analyst it helps to have  both analytical and programming skills so this   includes familiarity with databases also youll  need to know about statistical analysis and also   data visualization is another important skill  so data analytics is often more focused on using   statistical tools and techniques to interpret  existing data and offer actionable insights   its usually less concerned with creating  new algorithms or models data science   on the other hand has a broader scope that can  involve complex machine learning algorithms often   created from scratch data science focuses  on phases from data collection to predictive   modeling data analysis on the other hand is  more about answering specific questions with   that data and if youve done both your  data science and data analytics right   youll always be able to keep cantaloupes  and just about everything else in stock
