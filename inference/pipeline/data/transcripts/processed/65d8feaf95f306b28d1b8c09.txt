designer from brussels of belgium today we are going to talk about the languages for data visualization and animations there are essential tools for conveying complex information in account size and easy to understand way there are a variety of programming languages out there that can be used for these tasks some are better suited than others for the job of course whether you are a novice programmer or an experienced one learning the best programming languages for data visualization and animation can help you create effective graphs and charts from javascript to python to after effects and beyond today we are going to explore which are the best programming languages for data visualization as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each one so lets see in detail which are these languages javascript javascript is an objectoriented programming language thats mainly used for clientside scripting although its often used for frontend web development javascript can be used for many others data visualization and animation tasks such as creating interactive graphs and charts for example d3js is a popular javascript library for visualization but its not the only one there are literally tens and tens of lib libraries that you can use to create data visualizations and interactive animations as i said there are many other libraries and tools that are compatible with javascript making the versatile programming language javascript is an easy programming language to learn and get started with making it a good choice for beginners additionally javascript runs on every device and platform making it an excellent choice for creating a crossplatform applications python python is a general purpose programming language that is often used for data analytics and data science and scientific computing it has a wide range of libraries and tools that allow you to create sophisticated data visualizations and animations for example the matplotlib library allows you to create the charts and graphs and the seaborn library allows to create statistical graphs very easily the python programming language is an excellent choice if you are looking to create data visualization and animation with a lot of complexity and details python is also easy to learn and has a friendly syntax making it a good choice for beginners since python is a crossplatform and open source its widely used in many industries and organizations which means that it has a large and active community of users and developers c plus plus but c plus passage is a general purpose of programming language that is used for everything from web development to computer graphics its a compiled and objectoriented programming language that allows you to create sophisticated and detailed data visualizations c plus plus has many features that make it an excellent choice for database and animation such as the ability to handle large data sets and high performance functions it has a larger number of libraries and tools that you can use for data visualization such as the opengl library which is used to create a 3d computer graphics plus plus is a relatively difficult programming language to learn and isnt ideal for beginners it is however a good choice if you are looking to create a detailed data visualizations with high complexity processing processing is a programming language and environment that is used for visual arts design and computer art it was originally developed for artists and designer to create visual art pieces and images processing simplicity and ease of use make it a good choice for new programmers to create data visualizations and animations additionally its crossplatform compatibility makes it a good choice for creating web visualizations to visualize your data you can use the builtin functions to create the interactive graphs and visualizations if you are looking to create more complex charts you can use the programming language which is similar to c plus plus on java and allows you to create a more sophisticated and detailed pieces music matlab matlab is a programming language and environment for technical computing personally i used it for the first time during my engineering statics at the university its commonly used for advanced data animations and visualizations such as 3d visualizations all thought its mainly used for more advanced and technical visualizations matlab is also suitable for nonprogrammers who are just getting started with database its a crossplatform and open source making it a good choice for web visualizations r r is not only a letter of the alphabet but it is also an interpret programming language designed in 1993 for statistical computing and graphics its commonly used in data science and big data applications or data visualization and animation are essentials are these reviews and accessibility mechanical choice for nonprogrammers to create visualizations additionally its across crossplatform and open source so this is a good choice for web data visualizations projects or has many builtin functions that allow you to create statistical graphs and visualizations if you are looking to create more complex data visualizations you can create more complex functions as our supports procedural programming with functions and for some cases object oriented programming as well after effects after effects is a visual effects and motion graphics software used to create visualizations and animations its commonly used for motion graphics and web animations transitioning between scenes and animated graphics in general it has a lot of builtin functions and tools that allow you to quickly create animated videos after effects also allows you to create very artistic animations you can create graphs and charts either 2d or 3d with ease if you are looking to create more complex data visualizations you can use the scripting languages and expressions which are included in after effects and are based on javascript if you are a motion designer and need to create a bar chart races and bytes pie charts you can choose barber chart which is a bar chart race script for after effects but if you dont like script in our expression so theres really large number of data visualization templates for after effects on the internet im gonna link leave some links in the description below foreign data visualizations and animations with programming languages is a great way to present data in an engaging and easy to understand way when choosing which programming language to use you should consider your skill level the complexity of your project and the oppressed in system of your target device or platform note that you know more about the best programming languages for data visualization and animation its time to put your newfound knowledge to good use ultimately the best choice of language or framework will depend on your specific needs and goals as well as your existing skills and experience its worth experimenting with different options to see which one you find the most comfortable and suitable for your tasks so thank you very much for listening subscribe
