imagine that you are in las vegas in a casino and you decide to play a game on one of the casinos computers just like you might play solitaire or chess the computer can make moves in the game just like a human player this is a coin game it starts with a coin showing heads and the computer will play first it can choose to flip the coin or not but you dont get to see the outcome next its your turn you can also choose to flip the coin or not and your move will not be revealed to your opponent the computer finally the computer plays again and can flip the coin or not and after these three rounds the coin is revealed and if it is heads the computer wins if its tails you win so its a pretty simple game and if everybody plays honestly and the coin is fair then you have a 50 percent chance of winning this game and to confirm that i asked my students to play this game on our computers and after many many tries their winning rate ended up being 50 percent or close to 50 percent as expected sounds like a boring game right but what if you could play this game on a quantum computer now las vegas casinos do not have quantum computers as far as i know but ibm has built a working quantum computer here it is but what is a quantum computer well quantum physics describes the behavior of atoms and fundamental particles like electrons and photons so a quantum computer operates by controlling the behavior of these particles but in a way that is completely different from our regular computers so a quantum computer is not just a more powerful version of our current computers just like a light bulb is not a more powerful candle you cannot build a light bulb by building better and better candles a light bulb is a different technology based on deeper scientific understanding similarly a quantum computer is a new kind of device based on the science of quantum physics and just like a light bulb transformed society quantum computers have the potential to impact so many aspects of our lives including our security needs our health care and even the internet so companies all around the world are working to build these devices and to see what the excitement is all about lets play our game on a quantum computer so i can log into ibms quantum computer from right here which means i can play the game remotely and so can you to make this happen you may remember getting an email ahead of time from ted asking you whether you would choose to flip the coin or not if you played the game well actually we asked you to choose between a circle or a square you didnt know it but your choice of circle meant flip the coin and your choice of square was dont flip we received 372 responses thank you that means we can play 372 games against the quantum computer using your choices and its a pretty fast game to play so i can show you the results right here unfortunately you didnt do very well laughter the quantum computer won almost every game it lost a few only because of operational errors in the computer laughter so how did it achieve this amazing winning streak it seems like magic or cheating but actually its just quantum physics in action heres how it works a regular computer simulates heads or tails of a coin as a bit a zero or a one or a current flipping on and off inside your computer chip a quantum computer is completely different a quantum bit has a more fluid nonbinary identity it can exist in a superposition or a combination of zero and one with some probability of being zero and some probability of being one in other words its identity is on a spectrum for example it could have a 70 percent chance of being zero and a 30 percent chance of being one or 8020 or 6040 the possibilities are endless the key idea here is that we have to give up on precise values of zero and one and allow for some uncertainty so during the game the quantum computer creates this fluid combination of heads and tails zero and one so that no matter what the player does flip or no flip the superposition remains intact its kind of like stirring a mixture of two fluids whether or not you stir the fluids remain in a mixture but in its final move the quantum computer can unmix the zero and one perfectly recovering heads so that you lose every time laughter if you think this is all a bit weird you are absolutely right regular coins do not exist in combinations of heads and tails we do not experience this fluid quantum reality in our everyday lives so if you are confused by quantum dont worry youre getting it laughter but even though we dont experience quantum strangeness we can see its very real effects in action youve seen the data for yourself the quantum computer won because it harnessed superposition and uncertainty and these quantum properties are powerful not just to win coin games but also to build future quantum technologies so let me give you three examples of potential applications that could change our lives first of all quantum uncertainty could be used to create private keys for encrypting messages sent from one location to another so that hackers could not secretly copy the key perfectly because of quantum uncertainty they would have to break the laws of quantum physics to hack the key so this kind of unbreakable encryption is already being tested by banks and other institutions worldwide today we use more than 17 billion connected devices globally just imagine the impact quantum encryption could have in the future secondly quantum technologies could also transform health care and medicine for example the design and analysis of molecules for drug development is a challenging problem today and thats because exactly describing and calculating all of the quantum properties of all the atoms in the molecule is a computationally difficult task even for our supercomputers but a quantum computer could do better because it operates using the same quantum properties as the molecule its trying to simulate so future largescale quantum simulations for drug development could perhaps lead to treatments for diseases like alzheimers which affects thousands of lives and thirdly my favorite quantum application is teleportation of information from one location to another without physically transmitting the information sounds like scifi but it is possible because these fluid identities of the quantum particles can get entangled across space and time in such a way that when you change something about one particle it can impact the other and that creates a channel for teleportation its already been demonstrated in research labs and could be part of a future quantum internet we dont have such a network as yet but my team is working on these possibilities by simulating a quantum network on a quantum computer so we have designed and implemented some interesting new protocols such as teleportation among different users in the network and efficient data transmission and even secure voting so its a lot of fun for me being a quantum physicist i highly recommend it laughter we get to be explorers in a quantum wonderland who knows what applications we will discover next we must tread carefully and responsibly as we build our quantum future and for me personally i dont see quantum physics as a tool just to build quantum computers i see quantum computers as a way for us to probe the mysteries of nature and reveal more about this hidden world outside of our experiences how amazing that we humans with our relatively limited access to the universe can still see far beyond our horizons just using our imagination and our ingenuity and the universe rewards us by showing us how incredibly interesting and surprising it is the future is fundamentally uncertain and to me that is certainly exciting thank you applause
