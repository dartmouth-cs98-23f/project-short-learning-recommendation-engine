im daniel a software engineer at microsoft exsoftware engineer at amazon and ebay and also a software engineering mentor at two educational startups in this video im going to talk about the best programming languages you should learn as a beginner whether as a hobby a student or someone whos seriously considering making a career transition etc programming languages youve heard about them c c objectivec c f java javascript python swift html css sql go kotlin ruby scala perl i mean holy 💩 the sheer list itself is overwhelming theres just so many of them and guess what thats not all you obviously dont have the time to learn all those so which language should you focus now as a beginner what is the best language for setting that first step in a particular industry or which ones should you avoid as your first language well lets find out first off heres the list of programming scripting and markup languages that i know in the order of most popular technologies list in the survey of 2021 stack overflow javascript html css python sql java nodejs typescript c bash c c and powershell most of which ive used professionally some of which ive used on my personal project or learned myself just to set the right expectations here theres no such thing as the ultimate programming language this language is the best that language is the worst this one sucks the most 🤮 there are obviously pros and cons for each programming language and even a language thats worst to learn can actually be the best to use for certain situations for the purpose of this video ive personally curated six programming languages that are best for beginners to learn in terms of popularity utility and relevance popularity is it commonly used utility is it widely used relevance is it futureproof ill give tailored suggestions for each language in terms of these criteria so given your current situation personal preference or the type of industry youre interested in you can decide which suits you the best before i tell you which languages are the best let me first tell you the two languages you should definitely avoid as a beginner at least not until you are quite comfortable with the ones im about to mention they are c and c why not c you know c is the language that started the oop object oriented programming paradigm there’s no doubt about that but because it’s the language that started it all it’s also the most premature of all compared to other languages that came after it like java and c in terms of its syntax i mean c is probably one of the most convoluted and difficulttowrite programming languages out there i’ve talked to some of the skilled professionals and senior c engineers in microsoft before despite developing with the language for more than ten years they admit that they still spend a fair amount of energy and time fighting the syntax and not the logic that’s how bloody difficult that language is and i know there are a lot of universities or institutions that still teach computer science 101 with c well shame on you seriously what is your goal here to demotivate students and make them drop programming courses so that you can deal with fewer students i honestly cant believe it when i hear people say programming wasn’t their thing because they couldn’t keep up with c in their introductory programming course i mean i don’t think programming is for everyone either but c is definitely not the language you expect an entrylevel student to enjoy and keep up with but then when should learn c even though i still recommend against it you can consider learning it as your first language if you want to become a game developer why virtually all highendgames are in c playstation xbox unreal engine cryengine you can script unity games with c or javascript but guess which language unity itself is written in c is the choice for game development because it offers the highest performance you need that for gaming because all these graphics and split second calculations solely depend on your computer’s hardware on the other hand even if your computer lacks the computing power ordering stuff at amazoncomhttpamazoncom is not a problem because all the heavy computings done by their servers not your machine long story short learn c only if you are serious about game development if not try your best to avoid it the next programming language you should avoid as a beginner is c but it’s such a famous language well you are right c is a good language after all if c is the language that started oop c is the language that started everything it’s the mother of all languages however i don’t recommend it to beginners for one reason pointers you see many college students drop their c programming courses for the following reason either they encountered pointers or recursion recursion you just cannot avoid but pointers you can if you learn other highlevel languages like java and c in fact one of the goals in the creation of java was to invent a clike language but with a greater simplicity like removing pointers c c and pointers are all great similar to the reasons i gave for c but for most beginners you want to start off with a simple language that helps you focus solely on learning how programming works not fighting the syntax alright now that we’ve talked about the two programming languages you should avoid as a beginner let’s now talk about the six programming languages i recommend to beginners again i’m going to talk about them in terms of their popularity utility and relevance so take note of their pros and cons and see which one suits you the best the first programming language i recommend is javascript popularity according to stack overflow its the most commonly used language for nine years in a row why is it so popular then try to think of it this way you can pretty much say that everything you do on your browser runs on javascript chrome edge firefox safari doesnt matter its not going to be a productionlevel website without javascript not to mention that most software engineers also work on web utility its one of the most versatile languages out there id say shoulder to shoulder with python learn reactjs for frontend and nodejs for backend and hey youre a fullstack developer you still need to know the markup languages html and css but theyre hardly programming languages and are easy to learn making a website with one language was never possible before but it is now with the debut of nodejs whats more you can also develop mobile apps natively for both android and ios using react native yes react native is crossplatform compatible and even develop desktop apps with javascript using electron not only that you can make games on web and unity using javascript and lastly its used in machine learning and artificial intelligence too just to name a few others with web mobile desktop client server machine learning and ai combined you can pretty much dominate the entire world what about relevance well as ive mentioned earlier its the most popular and commonly used programming language now as such its one of the most soughtafter skills in the job market with the language born in 1995 its even older than some of you and it’s pretty much everywhere on the web with node strong on the server side react backed by the first letter of faang on the client side and the language itself backed by all browsers javascripts simply not going anywhere the second programming language i recommend is python popularity according to stack overflow its the third most popular language in 2021 and the most wanted language for its fifthyear its syntax is so simple and easy that its considered one of the best languages to learn for beginners it has a great support from the massive community and also has thousands of free excellent libraries out there helping you save time and focus on development utility again its versatility is shoulder to shoulder with javascript it can be used in nearly any kind of environment including web desktop mobile and hardware leveraged as a backend using django or flask utilized heavily in the fields of cloud computing and big data not to mention that its completely dominated the fields of ai machine learning and data science relevance its one of the first languages students choose to learn due to the high demand in job market and for this reason one of the core languages schools choose to teach lastly its a language thats heavily backed by not just one but multiple companies such as google facebook and aws and with a growing number of engineers choosing python as the language for leetcoding pythons not going anywhere either if you want a language that can open up many career opportunities and at the same time is easy and simple to learn python wont disappoint you the next two languages are those you should learn if you are serious about becoming a software engineer and studying computer science in depth you know establishing that solid foundation and they are c and java so the third programming language i recommend is c but hey i’m not recommending c prior to java simply because i work at microsoft my mother language is java i learned it in university have some experience developing android apps and servers with it and while many of you have seen that blue coffee cup with red steam coming out of it at some point in your life the only thing you can recall about c is probably that tricky note youve learned to play back in your middle school music class yes java was the more famous one it was the better one in fact c benchmarked java but the thing is c has not only caught up but also gotten better there are many features c provides that java does not or were added after c for example properties in classes extension methods generics with primitive types async and await keywords linq much better lambda the var keyword to name a few long story short there are obviously pros and cons to c as well but for learning a new language as a beginner which by the way is the point of this video c beats java in my honest opinion so lets go back to popularity utility and relevance popularity according to stack overflow net core is the most loved library guess which language its written in c c also tops the most commonly used language in the survey although its behind java but well get to that later but just think about why people love it the most its probably because its easy simple and convenient to use in many aspects which can translate to easy simple and convenient to learn in many aspects utility c is surprisingly versatile for a strongly and staticallytyped language you can build windows applications backend servers cloud apps on azure native mobile apps for both android and ios via xamarin games with unity internet of things etc relevance people also refer to c tech stack as windows stack well cuz microsoft developed it and you need c to develop windows things just like javascript and python c is used pretty much everywhere as well its open source and with microsoft backing it its a damn good core language to learn the fourth programming language i recommend is java like i said earlier java was ahead of c in terms of features but now its behind c in my opinion some people attribute the outcome in oracles acquisition of java and microsofts decision to go open source with c whether thats true or not i dont know but the good news is i still find java to be an excellent language to learn popularity according to stack overflow its the fifth most popular language and the most popular strongly and staticallytyped language even beating c but if c is so loved by the developers how come it falls behind java in popularity ranking i would say its because java had been dominant for a good number of years i mean ive seen big guys like google facebook amazon use java and other languages before but ive never seen or heard a single one of them use c c is simply not the top language of choice for the big players maybe because microsoft is their direct competitor not 100 sure but javas also been around before some of you were even born and how does the developers most beloved language or framework matter when theyre not so much loved by the employers 🤷 utility javas ubiquitous more than three billion devices run java according to oracle many server applications are written in java using frameworks like spring and most importantly you need java for android development i know the official language for android has recently changed to kotlin but javas still a dominant language regardless and one with a great online community for support relevance java continues to be one of the most used development platform lots of android apps are built with java many schools still teach computer science with java as the primary language not to mention a huge community its cultivated over the decades backed by oracle itself javas still a solid core language to learn with a strong demand in the job market the fifth programming language i recommend is swift so you might think this is an odd choice and i agree in a sense that swift is mainly used for apple devices but apple indeed is one of the faang and we can no longer talk about a computer a phone or even a watch without apple and if im going to include java in my list of recommended programming languages for android i figured its only fair of me to include swift for ios because after all there might be some of you out there who want to become apple developers 🍎 so popularity is it really popular with the popularity index at 51 at stack overflow i wouldnt say so but i guess its not a matter of popularity but necessity because its what apple uses to write their own software its like when you join microsoft you have no option but c utility you can use the language to develop native apps for ios mac apple tv and apple watch ive never done it myself personally but i guess its kinda cool relevance hey the 2 trilliondollar company is not going anywhere anytime soon the last programming language i recommend is sql i dont know why but for some reason its pronounced sequel not sql but we write sql 😕 so what is sql it stands for structured query language a programming language used to communicate with relational database and its also the language you need to know in order to call yourself a full fullstack engineer because sql falls within backend now its true that companies are shifting towards nosql nowadays but in my honest opinion sql or nosql theyre the same 💩 you can pretty much think of nosql as a simple sql where you wont likely have to do complex joins anymore you see even for apps that use relational databases writing complex queries joining multiple tables indexing a particular column where having group order by ugh is old school all developers universally want the same thing simplicity select  from table where partition key equals whatever is pretty much all you need to put sql down on your resume popularity utility relevance again databases are essential your apps not gonna do much without them its for the same reason you need to know how to query a database and its going to follow you everywhere due to its necessity alright so weve taken a look at the two programming languages you should try to avoid and six programming languages i recommend as a beginner here’s the summary avoid c due to the languages complexity unless you aim to become a game developer avoid c due to pointers learn javascript or python if you want simple easytolearn languages that are versatile has wide usage and good job prospects learn c or java if you are serious about becoming a software engineer or learning computer science in general learn swift if you want to build apple devices and finally learn sql to understand how databases work most importantly understand this whatever the language you decide to work with try to stick to it dont give up midway as a software engineer the ability to stick to one thing no matter the obstacles you face is an important skill i promise you if you get proficient with even one of the programming languages ive mentioned earlier except for sql learning any other language will be a breeze the six languages are what i would consider the core mainstream ones in 2021 there are other great programming languages out there i simply dont know enough about them to give any kind of recommendations but again starting with any one of them in the list is sufficient if you liked my video hop on board i invite you to be our next nakama thanks for watching ill see you on the next one bye
