and limitations of computing in short it is the study of what computers can do and more computers cannot do im subhas khot im a theoretical computer scientist we would like our computers to do a lot of things for us and in theoretical terms these are called designing algorithms to solve computation problems for the last several decades computer scientists have identified a very large class of problems these are known as np complete problems which they would really like to solve fast  but now they have more or less accepted that these problems cannot be solved fast the unique games conjecture it states that certain very specific computational problem about coloring nodes of a network to satisfy certain compatibility conditions and the conjecture states that this problem is very hard to solve and in fact very hard to even find there is only approximate solutions and what the main consequence or the implication of the unique games conjecture is that if you believe that this one specific problem is hard to solve it implies that lots and lots of other problems which computer scientists are very interested in there also hard to solve the unique games conjecture its its not yet proven however the research surrounding the conjecture all these efforts they have actually led to many many developments in computer science and mathematics on the other hand its also useful that certain competition problems simply cannot be solved fast and one such example being factoring integers for example if i tell you number 35 and youre supposed to find its factors if i times 7 this cannot be solved fast for when the numbers grow really large and it turns out that the security of almost on online systems lets say banking it depends on our belief that nobody knows how to factor integers fast so the unique games conjecture it led to quite surprising discovery in entirely unexpected area of research we know what elections are and often the result of an election is simply decided by majority vote uf there are two candidates then whichever candidate gets more votes wins the unique games conjecture it led to the reason that this votingscheme is stable under noise meaning even if the words where  miscountered or maybe there was little bit of noise in recording the votes it wont really change the the winner of the election by much for several years i have been trying to make progress on proving the unique games conjecture and in the last four or five years me along with my coauthors we do have a quite promising approaches that im excited about i personally have started believing that we do have actually an approach to prove it and im im excited in following these approaches and i see where these go
