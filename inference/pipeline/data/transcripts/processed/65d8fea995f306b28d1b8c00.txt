when ething the render button have you ever wonder why rendering takes so long today im gonna take a look at how does rendering actually works were going to take a look at offline rendering and not realtime so every treaty scene has some objects and a camera the camera will be what we will use to actually render a frame or an image has a render the camera has basically a position in space and therefore here will have a cube render to it we send to each pixels of the camera some rays here in blue the rays is basically colliding to infinity lets take a ray that intersect with an object that means that you send the ray in red right here and eventually the ray will collide through an object in the scene here being the cube for every pixels you send the ray and when a ray its an object you will send bunch of other race mostly in the shapes of emma sphere all of those sub rays needs to it a point when a light source is emitted here is the light source then we intersect with a cube and send bunch of rays and the green one will eat the light source that means that you now have to process the thing another use case will be to send the ray on a plane and then shoot many other rays lets say you have a cube that basically reflects some spot light on it because it has a reflectance once the ray from the plane intersects with the cube the spot light emits a source of light all those yield yellow rays will basically be computed to be reflected onto the simple intersect point on the plane
