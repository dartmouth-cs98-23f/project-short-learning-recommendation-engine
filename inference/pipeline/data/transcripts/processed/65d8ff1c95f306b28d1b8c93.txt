uh with as much work and on quantum complexity theory as from the physics side and which has lots of work on quantum hamiltonian complexity error correction and then uh its pleasure to also have adam adam recently won the philip meyer prize in theoretical physics for his work on which is quite relevant on on the dynamics of quantum many body systems especially using uh techniques using uh involving random quantum circuits so um so uh to to kick off the panel let me just let me just start by putting out a somewhat provocative vision along the you know uh i think that maybe shivaji had been hinting at but this is this is at least the way a computer scientist would look at it so let me let me just try to see how i view it so uh so you know you you might say well how would quantum computers be be useful well you know we have we have several ways we could think of it one is well we are going to solve optimization problems or things like factoring you know welldefined computational problems of that kind the the other way we could say is well you know lets lets go back to the fact that quantum quantum computers would allow you to simulate quantum mechanics efficiently and thats surely a very important thing to do so and and what else could there be well well theres a theres a third way to look at it which is if you look at classical computers one of the things that they provide us with is is an excellent interface to to the world um you know and and then in computer science terms we talk about the human hci human computer interface and so well if we think about it in the in the context of of the quantum world then then this takes on a completely different different view in the sense that hilbert space is very large and the way we could think about it is that that our experience of this of hilbert space is mediated through through uh you know whichever parts of albert space are you know are accessible through the fact that they are amplified to the classical world through measurements and so could it be that um that once we have quantum computers that that this allows us to prove through a parts of hilbert space that we you know we wouldnt have been able to probe otherwise you know so that so that it it you know that our classical experience which which we could think of as as you know as an experience of the parts of hilbert space that we can normally we normally have access to you know could we actually enhance that by by by mediating it through through a quantum computer so i i know this sounds sounds somewhat uh you know part you know but um but you know this is one way you could think about this interactive quantum dynamics and say what can we achieve through through this method so anyway ill turn it over to the panelists to take a few minutes to get their thoughts about about um you know they may have about shivajis talk about and also about anything else theyd like to like to bring up so um almost one comment about what you just said of course um you know what the talk that we heard today which was very nice from shivaji is not quite like that because often we have classical predictions and you know we come with theories and so on so were not entirely open to you know we we want to have a problem where where the experiment is actually telling us hey you know this is going on and now lets try to explain it better or right it has to be come first from the experiment and then maybe the theorists will have some classical description of it right that would be more interesting um so so youre saying youre saying um um it it it could be that that um that that um that the phenomenon would actually first come up in experiment before we actually understand it yeah that would be the more interesting thing in in because now i think i mean i i you know i dont want to do i want to do justice to you know the talk that we just heard i found it interesting but its something where you say well we expect maybe something like this and now were testing this but its no its not its a confirmation but of course things get really interesting when the experiment shows up things that we regularities or patterns that we do not quite understand it can kind of work you know work in conjunction in the sense that you you you sort of uh say well if you look in this direction we may find something but then you look you look for it you find it but then you find something else as well so in other words where do you look where do you start by looking and uh and and so in in you know you could sort of say well how um you know if if we wanted to if we wanted to use well first to what extent is it possible but then if you wanted to use quantum computers to mediate the search for for uh for for sort of you know isnt it possible that one could have completely new physical phenomena that were not accessible to us because because the normal mechanisms for observation would not have revealed them to us those phenomena to us but theyre now access they might be accessible just because we have we have an intermediary which is a quantum computer yeah i think thats interesting but maybe some of the other panelists have thoughts on this yeah i i think we are not there yet but i think which is that you know it should be you know its a new physical system and it should do things you know the real payoff is going to be to run it in experimental mode in which you search and hopefully you need some cost function which tells you whats interesting and then you then you go looking so this talk was more to say you know the way to look at it is perhaps to say supposing we had had such devices 20 years ago maybe we would have found time crystals by searching for them on these devices whereas we couldnt have found them on you know other devices so i mean i absolutely agree with you know what she said coming back to what you said i think as a formal matter um right were going to be looking at a certain in the space of heaven which are made up of this territory of you know unitaries and measurements now the answer to your question is somehow buried in there which is to say that if you were simulating you know some aspect of the world which you normally perceive in a certain way you know would you perceive it sort of differently if you could if you could go this way so i think you maybe have to simulate the world closer to the one we live in as opposed to you know but in principle i think theyre the same ultimately any experiment in the observation you know its start somewhere in the end somewhere you do some number of things along the way music so so what youre looking for fits in this larger class of evolutions somewhere um should i pick up on something shivaji said at the very beginning maybe i can ask you on the connection or something so you um made a comment at the beginning about um you made a contrast with between quantum computation and the kind of things we think about in stat mech in terms of kind of a system which is sort of statistically homogeneous everywhere versus a very highly structured computation and um so i wanted to ask sort of how much if we want to make a bridge between those things how much is that a worry and or or might be possible to put things which are more like real quantum computations in a statistical mechanics language so for example as a question for quantum information people might it make sense to have sort of random ensembles of algorithms which look a bit like more like a statement problem you know in the sense that we have in many body physics random hamiltonians random matrix theory and we can have random circuits but presumably thats not anything like what youd think of as a computation but is it imaginable that you could have um random ensembles of algorithms so you could start to ask in a statistical mechanics language about generic properties of quantum computations and things like that or are you always going to have this problem that shivaji mentioned but a real computation of interest is always something specific and structured and theres a disjunction with the kind of things we think about in stomach theres a bit of a vague question but i just wonder how how close do you think is that is that for is that for me or shivaji im im not um its for anyone here well i think i can tell from the experience that uh there is a there is a impact and the community of interest for a given algorithm we do and then there is a computational complexity of that algorithm so one time which we did it successfully the community of interest became very very narrow we managed to make big strings with high fidelity better than classical computer so we outperform a classical computer but the community of interest become very narrow so i imagine that the next case we might solve a problem lets say related to outoftime order correlation or something that would have a slightly bigger community of interest or bigger bigger class of group of algorithm so i think you guys are maybe uh talking a little more general that you know cost functions and algorithm in general i think uh these are a little further down in the down the line in the future but i think uh various specific cases like you know time crystals or um highly in the group of algorithms or the class of algorithms uh were gonna gonna um very slowly grow and the community of interest is going to people who care about those cases are going to very slowly grow is not going to be very different than our quantum supremacy experiment which was not you know which was highly contrived to to beat the classical computer essentially so i i think it would be very similar to that the next the next milestone okay maybe as a as a common to adam i think i i mean i think it doesnt right we like to you design optimal algorithms right so it doesnt fit very nicely with the statistical picture you know only when youre a very little child you do random things but you quickly learn the optimal strategies and uh but in that sense i think maybe machine learning and quality machine learning you have some of that where you can do some statistics right but not in the sort of critical design of algorithms at least i dont see it maybe i can ask a question to shivaji about his talk or about the field a bit um and this is on the effect of noise and also related to experiment so well you made the point you wanted the things were done to distinguish the effect of noise and thermalization um without you know presence of noise but a noise can also be you know uh positive right it is the noise in these devices is not the polarizing noises necessarily its actually if you leave the device alone uh most cubits just you know go to their ground state and with their some you know theres some fluctuations not entirely true but not necessarily very high entropy states so you could also have you know why not include the noise in the description of these phases or are there reasons so how does the field look at noise or lint blood equations so they say and and phases in those systems right actually it goes on the call may be able to speak more precisely to this but you know uh in terms of different kinds of noise because uh she and their equality stanford did a lot of the development broadly speaking um experience has been that if you add some fairly general then the time crystals to be well defined is and so now im hedging because you raised the question of you know could there be some very specific kind of noise which exists in these devices which could still leave you i i know maybe i know they thought a bit about it and indeed when we began the experiment part of the hope was that the experiment itself maybe tell us that the error model that one really should use for these devices is more specific than the one that was thought of initially in the quantum supremacy experiment but maybe vitica can jump in and speak to what we learned at the end of the day that would be great oh yeah so i can maybe say two things one is um in indeed you know in the mbl problem where the problem itself has structure if your noise also has structure so for instance in in mbl we have these conserved operators which mostly look like theyre aligned in the z basis so if you only had the phasing noise um which coupled to that z channel thats thats in a sense less dangerous than than spin flip noise so there are there are different kind of differences in that regard but you know in this particular platform there was no reason to expect that one type of noise is is dominant over another um so so then you know the depolarizing model works pretty well as an approximation but then let me give a second answer to that which is um music which shivaji alluded to which is you know can we which is the benchmarking business right so can we use noise maybe more as a as a feature rather than a bug right so can we can we maybe if we wanted to probe the properties of these l bits for instance can we can we it is certainly the case that you know the effect of noise is is different depending on what the intrinsic dynamics and your problem are to give you an example you know if you have some noise in some one cubit if youre in the localized phase the effect of the noise acts in time but doesnt really spread out in space on the thermalizing side the effect of noise you know spreads over space very quickly um and that that is what the supremacy experiment was was plugging into so so i think its a its a broader uh question to see you know if you have different types of noise could we use that to characterize the dynamics based on how they couple to the noise but but at least just for the time crystal experiment there was nothing extremely special there but is there was there a limit because the time crystal experiment you know with a certain number of rounds and what if you would gone uh ten times longer would you you know would i assume you believe it be the same it would uh not be um over dominated by noise is that right or is this yeah yeah so okay so so this is um shivaji didnt delve into this in too much detail but you know one of the indeed i mean you you know instead of decaying exponentially in the space time volume in the time crystal experiment youre mostly decaying exponentially in time because the the effect of the noise is not is not spreading out too much so if you wait long enough in a realistic experiment the signal will go to zero so some of the things that we did was to employ kind of time reversal protocols to try to distinguish between this intrinsic thermalization and external noise so you know so for instance what we did is we we measured the same autocorrelators but time evolved with u dagger u which of course unitarily would be would be just one um but but then what it what it picks up is is more the if you get a decay for that autocorrelator thats coming dominantly from the noise because if it is perfectly unitary there would be nothing and in in the limit of being deep in the mbl phase if you kind of divide out the actual dynamics with this kind of normalization factor um you you reproduce what you should get to to very good accuracy so so what that means is that um you know at some point youre going to hit the noise floor in the experiment you know so so this this division works well on on a computer but there youll get numerical precision and a lab youll hit measurement precision but but but modulo those things yes we could have gone a factor of two longer in time and and still been able to see something its just a signal to noise ratio you have to average for a long time and then at some point we get tired of averaging maybe i can ask a question in the bedroom so in terms of the platform i mean when do you see it impossible to actually feedback its hard to make promise publicly so maybe i should definitely not not next  about that uh we are focusing for pat on passive error correction currently um for for active correction you have to uh bring the time of the readout of the qubits much closer to the time of the gate and particularly on the experiment that you mentioned on your last minute of talk on measurement induced the current challenge for us is that the gates are about 30 nanoseconds but the time to measure the state reliably is close to 800 nanoseconds so and the feedback and the measurement induced transition both needs a much shorter readout time and thats a very hard engineering challenge which we are working on so uh i think first you would hear from us that we have managed to do shorter readout and then then these feedbacks would follow problems so so in in terms of actually being able to do an interactive experiment that that you would say would is is a little ways off yeah i i yeah i think so its uh certain engineering challenges are really rooted in deep physics that we dont have good understanding from um sorry but um just just pursuing that a little bit about the interactive aspect so survivor you youve worked on some of the complexity theoretic aspects of interactive you know experiments so can you say a little bit about that so its in in terms of well yeah i mean you know there are various reasons why one does these interactive protocols well yeah i dont know whether im able to comply in the sense that i havent thought about uh interactive proof systems for example in the in a while i more think about error correction these days and thats uh theres a lot of you there you also need interaction but uh well not maybe at the first first rounds you hope to get all the information about errors and then leisurely process this um yeah i dont know what to say im actually surprising that you surprised that you do you stress this interaction because a very oldfashioned point of view and economy information was like well if you do a measurement in the middle you know you can just replace it by something quantum and then you know you then but of course the point is youre using youre leveraging the power of classical computers in this interaction yeah and thats uh thats really the thing that makes it different well you know i i think that thats correct um you know of course that goes back to the very early days you know when when the question came up whether immediate measurements increase the power of quantum computing but but now there are there are also these other issues right having to do with well i mean you worked on that as well but uh in terms of uh you know how do you how do you deal with untrusted important devices but through interaction and how do you how do you use it to reach into hilbert space in ways that you would not be able to do music theres a whole new well i guess you guys have touched on a lot of this but um i mean along what barbara was saying about interaction it does seem like fault tolerance is a very important case here and its a situation where where errors dont belong so i mean people have talked about it in sort of vague terms in terms of but you know i guess one interesting thing is that if you have a generic quantum circuit like one error in the middle will will completely randomize the final answer and then a fault tolerance circuit looks very different one error in the middle will have no effect on the final answer um and one i guess one related so yes what is the question one one question i have is um we do random quantum circuits as a toy model for a nonerror corrected quantum circuits um and and is there any way to sharpen that intuition like maybe a nonerrorcorrected quantum circuit where were just sort of not really trying to do things uh maybe theres some way to compress it so that it really looks even more like a random quantum circuit you know like maybe were not being as efficient with our degrees of freedom but theres a way to to compress it so it looks nearly random um i dont know exactly what the right questions are there but it seems like theres a vague intuition there that like we study circuits because theyre a proxy for generic quantum dynamics i wonder if theres a way to sharpen that in any way could you say again what it was you wanted to compress you you want to start with a generic random circuit and or you or you want generic circuit lets say lets say i have a circuit to you know factor short algorithm you do shores algorithm or simulate the transverse field i see model on a quantum computer but there are various tricks that people have to say well you know sometimes we can save a few qubits here maybe we can model the circuit as a tensor network and we find that its not quite as entangled across this cut so we could we could compress this side to fewer cubics um there are various papers about you know simulating large quantum circuits on smaller quantum computers and and they hit limits when you could say its maybe it becomes hard to compress because the amount of entanglement across uh subsystems becomes nearly maximal so um so im not quite sure what the right and now what the right thing is there i will say you know for classical data translation theres a sort of heuristic idea that sort of generically if im just typing english thats not full entropy but if i run it through a data compression algorithm i get something thats nearly full entropy and you know maybe thats a start a good starting point if im going to um try to use to to encrypt it in a graphic way this is all this is all very heuristic but um theres a sense that sort of generic generic data is not you know has some entropy but its not full entropy but compressing it makes it nearly full entropy so you know this is extremely handwavy what im saying but uh i wonder if theres any utility just trying to formalize any of it well its almost like a sort of arcgish idea that you want to coarse grain and sort of flow off to a fixed point so you want a certain circuit go off fully random yeah dont we know that for a generic circuit you cant compress it very much that it still has a generically it has a circuit complexity which is proportional to its depth just with them with right which is more than one well this you know this video call like you know a generic um communication message i cannot compress but yet this video call is compressed because our you know our faces are not generic images so um thats thats the intuition of you know maybe many quantum circuits can be compressed um another way of saying that is you know a lot of these random circuits they thermalize to infinite temperature but you know things are are not always at infinite temperature um and so theres thats another way in which the theory could be could be developed a little bit more of uh i mean i think there you know there are there are random circuits that have conserved quantity so yeah i dont know if thats the right direction sorry just very quickly um you you mentioned sort of in one breath the simulating the isaac model or something like that and a quantum algorithm to do a useful task a computational task but maybe the question that many of us statistical physicists would have is how should we heuristically think of what those circuits which are doing something computationally useful look like and how do they look different to chaotic evolution of a manybody system and thats i dont have any intuition for that that was sort of what i was trying to get to before yeah i mean its very complicated enough others have insight into this but you know just think about an algorithm that multiplies two numbers or does modular exponentiation in a lot of these if you have one bit that gets flipped its going to affect a lot of other bits and if it didnt then you could probably paralyze it you know if you have little blocks and each bit in there doesnt affect you any other bits then that means that theres scope to to parallelize it um and thats so thats thats sort of like why i suggest that uh you know if youve taken advantage of all the efficiencies you can then then things you know that it may start to look look like a random circuit even though yeah thats the vague intuition behind that yeah can i can i comment on this or can i maybe pick up on this please yeah yeah so maybe an answer and a ques to an attempted answer to adams question about a random ensemble of algorithms and basically sending this question to the computer scientists here so if i i take for example a piece of quantum material at some reasonable lowish temperature or energy density and i take it out of equilibrium and i let it evolve in time and its going to generate very nonlocal entanglement very nonlocal correlations its performing some kind of quantum computation in the end we can read off an answer in a set of readout qubits and the answer will generically be something like what is the uh diffusion coefficient of this uh quantum material right well get this answer and well get actually the same answer no matter what is the disorder realization in this material as long as the average disorder is is thinking so the question is in what sense can this be thought of as if we think of this material as a circuit uh as as a quantum algorithm as an ensemble of quantum algorithms that proves the same answer and we can somehow try to analyze it in computer science ways and see if it has a quantum it gives a quantum advantage for example is is this an example of um in symbol of algorithms that we can actually and have actually looked at in in statistical mechanics analysis well i i dont want to do real things too much with the compression thing but one thing you could do in this kind of low temperature setting is if you could say well suppose the system has a some entropy density so that means that you can take little blocks and compress them and maybe you can do the then you can that could be on your that could the quantum computer could do that fairly cheaply perhaps and then the dynamics could be done um you know that then you could do the dynamics on this on this compressed space um and and then even though your the underlying system is low temperature that would be gonna be closer to something where where each qubit looks closer to maximally mixed now theres still many many steps from there to like does it fully look like a random quantum circuit but that would at least be you know getting closer to something where even though youre simulating a low temperature system you do some fairly mild compression and you get something that looks closer to infrared maybe one comment also coming back to this error correction full tolerance is that of course if you have errors in your circuit you also have an ensemble of circuits and if its full tolerant then youre below threshold and it is keeping its functionality right but if youre if youre not or you havent designed it well then you are its losing its functionality so i think that thats maybe the best example i can think of that its music sorry there was a theres a related point that for shivaji you know when you spoke about your time crystal experiment there was theres something that you brought up which i didnt fully understand so so you said well look um normally youll be youd be probing the you know youre youre being in an equilibrium phase where youre probing the low energy states and and here what youre what youre saying is you you find ordering throughout the hilbert space uh you know including at you know your high energy eigenstate so can you can you see a little bit more about that just to well um but let me um let me describe it this way so you know this was a flowcare problem but theres a similar statement you know the paper we we first wrote um you know david hughes and myself and i wont list um its called localization protected quantum order so that one was actually on the transverse field eisenhower uh with random bonds and random fields this is actually a a very well studied problem there was a lot of work on this before we came along now whats interesting is that when you work on that phase diagram using the tools of statistical mechanics if you say ill just take that hamiltonian and calculate the properties of e to the minus beta h then you cant find any order at any nonzero temperature because thats the celebrated theorem in electrical mechanics that you cannot break a discrete symmetry in one dimension about zero temperature so all you have is what you would call the parameter so but when you examine the individual eigenstates of the hamiltonian going all the way up uh you know in energy at least in the in the case which is described by by free fermion it gets more complicated but but it it doesnt really matter the point is in the statistical mechanical version what should have happened was that any nonzero energy density above the ground state should have given you no cementite and in fact you get it at nonzero energy densities and in this special case you get it at any energy density whatsoever so thats the case where you have a hamiltonian you can be very sharp because you can define the energy density with respect to the hamiltonian but the floquet unitary right since the unitary is not really an energy so its sort of the but what you can ask is how close you are to a certain kind of state maybe you know you start with lets say all spins up and you get very far from it but in the case of the hamiltonian problem the localization protected order is very striking it really violates this theorem which you know goes back to landau which is that you cannot break discrete symmetries at nonzero temperatures in one dimension continuous symmetries two dimension thats the movements and localization allows you to get around i dont know is that quite yeah um im not im not sure i completely understood you know so so the sense i got was that um you know this was this was exploring the the high energy part of the spectrum not just the low energy part so is that you know to to to what extent is that unique to this expert you know so is is that something that um music so you know just in terms of well you know probing hilbert space which parts can you probe and not prove in experiments so can you say a little bit about place this in the in the you know in context and sure so i guess there are two issues one is as an as an experimental matter if i give you a solid right and you try and heat it up its got degrees of freedom you know theres a locally unbounded space so youre going to keep heating and so theres in a sense you dont get to infinite temperature just because you know things keep happening um now if you have a model system which which is um has a locally bounded hilbert space cube its then of course for spin systems or qubit systems you can sensibly talk about you know the sort of configuration which you would think of as being infinite temperature very high energy which is hard to do if you if you can just keep absorbing energy forever so within this more restricted class of systems which you either will realize to a good approximation basically ultimately anything has degrees of freedom going you know out forever so what you really need is that the local degree of freedom comes with some gap right so that youre able to sensibly excite things below the gap and not not above it too much so once youve accepted this locally bounded hyperspace description then you know then theres this distinction between finding interesting things happening for states which are very high energy with respect to hamiltonian and not finding something interesting so in the traditional understanding of statistical mechanics you wouldnt expect to find anything particularly interesting because the thermal density matrix at infinite temperature is just you know e to the minus beta h with beta equals zero so youre just taking a totally unrestricted average over all states um and um so so in this case that the fact that you can see things in individual eigenstates eth is the is the other way to look at it which is to say that every individual eigen state is supposed to reproduce for you the statistical mechanical density matrix and here these high energy states dont do that so theres special states which is where the localization comes great um this theres one more question from our second music hi hi shivaji hi nice to see you um so i wrote the question down so its hopefully clear tfnp is the complexity class which contains np problem problems with the property that every input has a witness i hope that makes sense so there are np problems for which it is guaranteed that there is uh like a witness that satisfies the problem right thats a special uh subclass of np uh there seems to be a connection of the to the topic of the talk today in the sense that in the relevant phase that you mentioned there is always a periodicity uh but im wondering if there is um hard or interesting computational problem uh that might be hiding here for example um finding the the um you mentioned that there is a time limit under after which you would get back to your original state for example so for example maybe its hard to find that time um you also mentioned that there are pairs there so maybe you know given one state find its you know its evil twin things like that um i im not sure if the second problem made sense i im actually have to say as im reading i i have as youll remember from the old days a very limited understanding of such matters so i tend to think of a witness mostly i think um so i guess this is the kind of witness is not a solution and its still still hard thats so big can i kind of translate slightly go ahead go ahead so correct me or uh if im getting this wrong but but um but maybe what what what ora is saying is that look um you know you have these systems where youre saying you know youre driving them at a certain certain frequency but then you see period some other completely different period show up uh in terms of the dynamics um or theres some other pattern that shows up so theres some pattern that shows up once you actually do the quantum revolution and the question is well is is is this something that might actually be hard to find you know so so in other words you set up the system and you have no idea what this what this pattern is and once you you know once you find it you can verify it and so on but uh you know could it be that these are hard computational problems hiding in in yours in your in the definition of your system i mean its an really interesting talk because in terms of using the these systems as experimental devices and going hunting for interesting things i think auras question would come up namely if you saw something interesting would you would you recognize it um right which is i mean physicists tend to have a standard you know we tend to think about the correlation functions local expectation values you know looking for certain kinds of order we have a list of things and you could imagine looking for that um yeah i dont know just like for a concrete example do you know how hard it is to find the period itself like the the time in which the periodicity appears uh again maybe im not getting the thats the real question but you know something like periodicity and youre putting a transform when you look for a peak i mean generally finding a period in some time series isnt that big a deal as long as the quantity that in who youre looking for a period is relatively easy to measure now maybe sorry i think music if i understand correctly or is asking you know so suppose you suppose you had a certain experiment in mind would you be able to predict what period you should see before you actually perform the experiment or would it be the experiment that reveals it to you and that you know if you if if you were trying to compute it especially if you were trying to compute it classically you wouldnt have a hope uh you know is that is that possible in this in the kinds of systems that you were looking at okay so let me try and repeat it in a way that i think i understand so is the question supposing you had it you had a set of local unitaries which certainly need a fundamental period to begin with and the question is does the actual evolution show some multiple or some you know do something else does it break that time translation symmetry in some way and can you say in advance i mean how easy would it be to you know to understand it i i dont know i mean its the a good question i mean it because in the limit of a large system you have a and its like a huge hamiltonian unitary right i mean its uh any naive before it certainly is not going to be in this case as barbara said at the start you know if you knew what we were doing what youre asking are there other things uh i i dont that doesnt seem easy to me maybe someone else has an answer but the disorder is also important here right shivaji you have to have you have a family of hamiltonians with this sort of right and thats what makes average quantities thats part of the question you dont have to average because every single disorder realization will eventually show this behavior at long times but youre going to have to wait a long time before you see it so thats what the phenomenon is robust but one reason its difficult to guess is because its not something that just stares you in the face when you start its not a few period phenomena its a long time large system phenomenon if there were other things like that they might well be hard too yeah actually that also leads to the question that i had is indeed that um you know for what other hamiltonians come on make these predictions because you know this of course is uh zz and then a transfer field that this that is matching the experiment very well but are there other candidates um that people have been looking at and that are experimentally um you know close or say of course you could they make small variants of these circuits that are i mean i dont know if another okay hamiltonian very different which is you know its predicted to show period doubling their other flowcase which show other periods you know i mean part of this class of things this is the simplest one great so i think we are we are approaching the end of the panel period so if if anybody has any quick thoughts on the panel or anything else to add actually maybe again since bedroom is here you mentioned that 800 to eight nanoseconds of the champion can you tell us what the what the physics challenges are that sort of um because the right um because uh there is a qubit and you read out the state by coupling it with a linear resonator if you couple it strongly so and then youre looking for the state of that resonator to be their frequency resonance frequency of that resonator shifts a little bit depending on your qubit to be occupied by is it zero or one shift that resonance frequency a little bit and youre looking for that shift so uh but since you want to read it out thats a challenging balance that if you couple it strongly so you can quickly read it out but then you decohere your system faster if you couple weekly then you have to integrate for longer time to recognize how much the resonance frequency have shifted so uh uh that thats the challenge uh and it is a big challenge for error correction but for nisk usually when you would have measurement at the end its not a challenge yeah i mean its major challenge for feedback but i hope we can come up with lots of exciting physics that you just need to read the states of cubit once at the end great um well maybe um yeah we can you know that was possibly this is a good stop so uh thanks everybody thanks thank you especially uh you know adam barbara and pedram for for being on the panel and thank you shivaji for and of uh thanks to the audience for for uh great questions thank you for inviting us off to join thank you very much thank you thanks a lot thanks bye
