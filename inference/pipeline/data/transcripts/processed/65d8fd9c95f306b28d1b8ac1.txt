so for uh those of you joining us uh were gonna get started maybe in about a minute or two if youre wondering why the olympics music is playing um it was because we thought itd be funny to have some background music so im going to leave that playing for another minute or so just wait for stragglers to join us my music music all right welcome to uh folks that are joining us today uh thank you so much for uh meeting us in this session this is a session that is going to run for an hour uh its called human computer interaction and user interface design its hosted by me my name is tony tang im an associate professor at the university of toronto and my colleague uh if you want to introduce yourself hi everyone im anastasia kuzminik im also professor at the university of toronto uh doing research in human computer interaction great and this is so this is the second session today for uh infocon 2021 so uh hopefully you uh have been were involved yesterday and saw a couple of sessions there and uh of course just as a reminder to you uh the sessions continue on uh through the day today and into tomorrow as well basically for the whole day so like if you arent getting enough of school right now you can uh you can continue to sign in from eight to five oclock uh pacific time uh for another eight hours of great content from different professors and faculty members uh uh in i schools across uh certainly across the north america no it also looks across the world so thats really really cool if you join the session just before this one that is called that was called ux and ui design careers uh uh hosted by a colleague of ours uh mark twydale um unfortunately at least i didnt attend the previous one because i didnt register in time so i dont im not sure if anastasia did i have no idea how much of the content is going to overlap however im going to throw myself out there and just say that i think none of the content is going to go overlap uh at least not really because ours is going to be way way better all right so um whats going to happen today is im going to give just a kind of a 20 minute kind of primer if you will on what we think about is user experience design and not really talk about our program per se but just kind of give you a hint about some of the things that you would be uh learning about and thinking about if you were part of a high school that had a user experience design program following that anastasia is going to do uh can remember if you wrote 27 27 minute talk ish minute seattle talk and im gonna show you how um academic research informs design and show you how our studies might look like um and things like that great so i think we are i i i think were open to questions through so if youve got a burning question uh even if its not burning but just kind of like a minor twitch uh please uh please please oh pop up your hand or type something into chat uh i can tell you as an instructor during these coveted times it is uh excruciating uh talking to my computer screen and a bunch of icons so if theres something i can talk at or respond to that feels a lot lot better so please feel free to ask questions at any time were more than happy to respond and dont worry well figure out how to make up that time a little bit later okay so uh if if theres nothing else i think thats basically housekeeping im just going to get going here and do the thing where i say okay let me share my screen and fuss around with this until i figure it out here so um screen is sharing we all see that its okay anastasia great okay so this is the first thing that i like to share at the beginning of many of my classes i think this is a hilarious example so uh this is a story uh actually now each year gets older and older but this is a story from about six years ago now i suppose and the headline is ford recalls suvs because drivers are accidentally turning them off and this is the console id like you to take a look at this and to try and think about whats going on here whats going on that makes drivers actually accidentally turn this uh suv off and i will give i dont know a virtual high five to the first person that can figure this out really really quickly so im going to give you i dont know 10 seconds of awkward silence if you think youve got it feel free to populate that in the chat in the meantime ill stare at you quietly okay that is far more awkward in real life than it is uh quietly in my office so um im gonna assume that you may have figured this out or you may not have but im gonna kind of walk you through whats going on here so this is the console dash right so this is where you would play with your radio and stuff like that for a car and one of the things that they did in this suv was they were being very innovative and decided instead of having any sort of stick shift control to to go from parking to reverse to neutral and so on they decided to make them into buttons along here so you can see parking uh reverse neutral drive and this is the sport setting not quite sure what the sport setting does but thats the sport setting right there and underneath youll notice right here this is the engine start stop button and so what was happening with this vehicle is that the start stop button was right there and people were essentially when they were kind of reaching over they were driving theyre like oh i need some sport mode here theyd reach over hit the button to to try to start sport mode but they werent looking because theyd be looking up there and or their finger would slip and then it would actually turn their car off while people were out driving the vehicle which is uh if you can think about situations where you might be wanting to switch into sport mode kind of dangerous right uh and so you know for me as somebody who thinks about user experience design who thinks about these experiences that were designing for people i actually think that for me im actually you know im im a little offended by the the the title here because i think this um this title of this article uh as perhaps descriptive as it may be actually um ascribes the blame to people who are driving the car right it describes blame to drivers but to me this is actually a design problem so if i were redesigning this uh this title what i would say is ford recalls suvs because poor user experience is creating dangerous situations because to me the fault should uh lie in the people that designed this thing not so much uh the people that are driving the cars uh so the title of this talk is called the primer on user experience design and human computer interaction what im going to do today is spend a lot of time talking about these little examples these toy examples that ive seen in everyday life and talk about how i think they kind of help us to understand why certain experiences are designed poorly and what they say about how we should design things objects tools or things that people use in in better ways so to me bad design is absolutely everywhere and in fact one of the bad things about kind of doing a program in user experience design is that you learn about what good design ought to be and so all you see in everyday life is how everything is terrible um on the left there uh if you are a guy that uses uh public uh washrooms youll understand why this is a challenge if you are not then i will describe the situation essentially this would be a very uncomfortable uh urinal situation to use uh to pee in um particularly if there was somebody else who was thinking about peeing next to you really needed to go its just ultimately not a lot of space the example on the right is also a bathroom bathroom example this is essentially an automatic faucet and essentially it it is it this is a situation where they decided to put up a sign because it wasnt clear how to use this thing right so it tells you that its an automatic faucet it explains you that to turn it on you need to walk up to the sink um uh and to turn it off you walk away from the sink so dont worry this thing is going to turn itself off i think the other thing so you know heres a sign that tries to explain how to use the thing right um i think the other thing thats really interesting about this example is that it says black clothing does not operate faucets like and as a former engineer in a previous version of my life i can understand why that would be the case but this is just horrible right so if im wearing black clothes like it doesnt work but actually if you kind of tease apart the language there it doesnt make a lot of sense either because to turn on and off you walk up and back but the clothes dont do that so anyway i think these are uh these are examples of of poor uh user experience designs im gonna show you this video that i uh that i watch this is munchies this is a a food uh a food uh food youtube channel that i like to watch anyway i just saw this clip the other day i thought it was really funny and kind of on point you will not be able to hear the audio um but what id like you to do is focus on this person right here and to think about whats gonna happen as she tries to go through that that door there okay so if you are like me if you are like her you have been in these kinds of situations before where youre trying to go through a door and for some reason it doesnt work quite the way you expect these are tiny little moments in your life but if you accumulate all those tiny moments across your life and across all the peoples lives that will go through that door you can kind of start to tally up how many instances of displeasure this causes and potentially how much time this wastes um and potentially you know maybe how much food is wasted as they kind of exit this place so whats happening of course here is that as shes trying to leave she tries to push the door and it doesnt work and uh and and everybodys laughing at her and its really funny but if you think about what shes doing what shes doing actually makes perfect sense this type of handle is the push handle she is doing the right thing or at least the way that the the the um the object is telling her to do it she is doing the right thing and so when it doesnt work its kind of weird youll notice on the other side of the door thats the side of the door that were sitting on um we actually see this handle right here which is a pull handle theres no question about it this is the pull handle and of course here again is a sign that is written there that says oh from here you need to push and so a couple of insights here um one is that often when you see a sign its because the tool itself or the object itself is not doing a good enough job of explaining exactly how the thing ought to be used and so uh people that use the environment are like oh i guess we gotta explain kind of how its working here or how its supposed to work right okay so i feel like im definitely doing the prof thing of just belaboring these kind of ridiculous little examples and so if you dont enjoy that then nows the time to sign up otherwise im gonna keep going on these kind of ridiculous little symbols uh these little ridiculous little examples um this is uh in in the in the uh in the sort of academic uh uh context this is what we call a signifier so the way in which the door handle is shaped is a signifier and it signifies a particular way of interacting with the thing and what we would say here is that the design problem is that the signifier is actually misleading it doesnt actually inform the person how to use it properly and youll know as a person that goes through doors youre not actively thinking about this its almost unconscious youre just like oh that handle okay this is the kind of thing i do um but thats exactly the moment where the signifiers matter right so choosing the right signifiers in the right moment for the right place is a really really important problem i was going through some old slide decks the other day and i realized that uh this uh this example which id like to show is now truly a classic example from my childhood and uh i i im curious how many people have any idea what this is and if you dont its not a big deal ill walk you through this uh if you do then you know exactly what im talking about okay so this is this used to be the back of uh most computers okay and this is kind of a little bit hard to uh explain without having like a computer in front of me but essentially the top part of the image that the part that has these two little black plugs is kind of like upright and then the bottom part of the image where theres a green and an orange uh icon its sideways like this so you can imagine that the two black things are kind of up here and down here im trying to show this in my little video here but my my book is all blurred out but anyway black black and then green and red so these two plugs are called uh ps2 uh plugs uh not playstation 2 i cant remember what ps2 actually stands for but anyway they were for your keyboard and for your mouse and uh they are the exact same plug right so our mouse yeah this is back in the data wired like wired peripherals and we didnt have usb yet right um and so we plugged these two things into our computer uh part of the problem is that usually its behind the computer so you can see the back of the computer but anyway even if you could see the uh computer um the back of the computer one of the problems is you werent sure which one to plug it into right you can see one of them is meant for uh the mouse one of them is meant for the keyboard and what i can tell you is the problem with this interface is that its not clear uh whether the green thing matches up with this this green thing matches up with the top green thing or whether it matches up with this green thing because you can kind of easily imagine that two different kind of ways to think about this maybe these two icons go like that and so they just kind of you know flip up like that or its kind of this mirror situation because youve also seen that too where this thing matches up kind of like that sort of like its a mirror type of a situation so these are the kinds of very simple versions of the problems that we deal with in user experience design and i would argue that these two design these two solutions that you can see on the right addresses this problem this is what we call a mapping problem so how do how do people map you know one uh particular series of things to another series of inputs so heres one solution if you simply put the icons next to the thing that we were supposed to plug into that would be very clear what to do similarly if you simply kind of use some color coding to support that mapping that would also help a lot and so these are kind of simple concepts that we kind of visit and revisit again when were kind of doing user experience design and when were doing human computer interaction uh research in the lab so um i want to invite a response or two on what you think this is i can tell you that uh this is something i took a picture of when i was on a trip so im interested to hear what people might imagine this uh would have been an image of i was on a i was on vacation i think so anything goes jill excellent elevator buttons gold star for you and i see moisies uh moises uh responded a little earlier jill and nicole gold stars for both of you these are elevator buttons what is okay fine jen you also get a gold star um lets give it a silver star with that olympic theme olympic medal uh our silver medal olympic theme okay anyway so these are indeed elevator buttons what i want to ask you now is to think about why like what makes this set of elevator buttons maybe so special whats so cool about whats going on here ah yes uh okay uh i see a response here im sorry im not quite sure how to pronounce that name but yes theres braille on here so braille is a way of allowing uh helping people that cant see that well um to read things right and so you can see here that there is braille on each of these on each of these elevator buttons whats really neat about it is uh braille is basically these uh like little raised bumps that you can rate you know run your finger over and that allows you to kind of like read text that allows you to render uh characters and letters and stuff like this so the reason i took a picture of this was it looks kind of cool so this is some like hyper doodad elevator where when you walk in you dont see anything but as the elevator door closes this cool like projection thing happens on the wall and so these like elevator numbers actually start to get projected so kind of and then you can kind of see this is a touch sensitive elevator so when you touch things uh it activates things so this is okay again maybe about five ten years ago so its really really cool and so you could in fact like and so this whole wall is basically a touch sensitive wall what is ridiculous about this so uh so hopefully at this point you might be able to see what the problem here is right so its a touch sensitive wall which is super cool on the other hand and its also super cool that theyre embedding some braille into the environment so that people that cant see that well right people who have uh vision deficit challenges they can also use the elevator as well by using braille but therein lies the challenge of course if i am a person that needs to use braille to read the elevator to read which buttons im supposed to press um im probably activating every single button by running my finger over each of these over each of these braille buttons so this is an instance where i would say the heart is in the right place but the execution is a little bit lacking to me this is uh what i would call sort of an obvious problem in hindsight but the real problem is that often the designers that are actually making the systems they often arent the ones that are using them and so often they make assumptions about how the systems are going to be used and so one of the things that we do in user experience design research and user experience design is we build empathy tools to try to understand who our users are and so in this case one of the things that you would say is like okay well if you were to do this a little bit better what you would do is youd you know put on goggles that make your vision kind of foggy and to try to learn how to read braille and to try to experience what that elevator would feel like thats something we call an empathy tool the other technique of course is that we use prototyping so we build things we mock things up and then we test the designs to see if we can uncover new problems that we hadnt anticipated before so we actually would give it to a set of uh people to test out uh as a pretend elevator we would try to find people that were trying to tackle with this uh system so if we were doing it for an office space fine find some office workers if we were trying to support blind users or people that have low vision then we would find some of those people and have them test out this elevator interface and just to see kind of how they experience this experience this interface oops so lets move on here i think this is a really important idea this notion that often designers arent the ones that are using the systems um heres an example i think i took this screenshot maybe about five years ago or something like that uh from my windows pc i turned it on one day and then like both of these things popped up im a computer scientist by training so i have some sense of what some of this language means but i can tell you that even in this moment uh so i was like ill do the right thing ill hit this update now button right so like you know as opposed to the notify me later except for never notify me because i never want to be bothered about it im so i was doing what i thought was the right thing and then this thing popped up and it was a really interesting moment where i was like actually right now im not sure what im supposed to do because what i did was i told the system like hey get the new drivers and sure fine scan my hardware do whatever youre supposed to do this is like maintenance stuff right and then down here it says okay update the system bios and my system is going to restart and i should close all the open documents and exit all the running applications dont interrupt the procedure once it begins dont just like this sounds really really serious and i can tell you as somebody who kind of like grew up around computers like i said computer scientists by training like even this gave me a moment even for me this gave me a moment to pause so i was like wait which of these things should i be doing here im actually not really really sure and then i and then if you think about this uh what would that experience be like for somebody who isnt a computer scientist who doesnt know what all of these words mean like what the heck does bios mean or is it even pronounced bios name is france bios right do not interrupt do not disconnect these are really really sounds like really serious things and theyre scary sounding and i think one of the things that we want to try to do when we build systems for people to use build tools for people to use build experiences for people to use because we want to make it so that it is a friction free experience as best we can we want to make it so that it is smooth we want to make it so that theyre not scared about the consequences of taking one action or another and so if you uh maybe you dont have to imagine maybe youve lived this experience if you imagine yourself seeing this and you have these two options install now or remind me later probably what youre going to do is hit remind me later and if you think about all the reminder me later that youve done in your on your own computer and i i certainly copped to doing it all the time myself um theres a ton of things that my computer needs to do that i never wanted to interrupt me to do because i dont know what the consequences might be and so this is the reason why so many computers are left not updated or vulnerable to you know all sorts of malware and stuff like that because you know we in practical reason um uh just ignore these things because were not quite sure what the consequences are and i see jen has contributed a quick comment uh where yeah you understand what a bios is but even then this is quite confusing right i just another example just because just while were at it um right so i told you that once you start to learn this stuff everything starts to look terrible but even if you havent learned this stuff you can probably see this thing is pretty terrible uh this is um i took this in washington dc this i believe is uh its like you get a ticket to use the subway uh with this machine and um i think if you use this all the time no big deal but i can tell you is the first time using this thing this is absolutely absurd um if you think about how reading works in north america normally you start reading from up here right top left you move right and then you go down um here the system is actually telling you okay look at the instructions and then over here theres in the middle theres this big loud thing that says this machine gives change in coins only right super loud right and then there are numbers that tell you to look at these different things like insert ticket here okay thats number one and then also insert validation but wait does number two mean insert coins uh and then how do i use this thing and when do i do this oh shoot theres an insert cash button over here um so maybe like presumably these are exclusive and then you can see take receipt is down here on the bottom left and also dont forget to take your change so theres a ton of things that are going on here and if you think about the engineering that is required to sort of make a machine like this happen you can kind of understand like different pieces parts of it are made at different times and stuff like this but really if youre thinking about the user experience of this machine i mean its awful right like where do i start where do i end hopefully the way you do it is you start from the top left and kind of move to the bottom right and everything gets done um but i can tell you that this is in my view sort of a hopeless interface uh kind of uh in a walk up and use kind of situation okay im obviously overstating the case i was able to get my ticket and stuff like that but of course that takes time that takes whatever five minutes of my time and thats a real thats a real problem uh five minutes of my time means the guy behind me is waiting for me and getting angry at me okay so im just going to show you a couple other examples anastasia i apologize i said 20 minutes i think were going to be 25 its okay so you can uh you dont have to okay so anyway im just uh im just having too much fun kind of complaining about the world that i live in this is okay so im realizing now this may be a function of you know being trained in user experience design it could also be a function of the sort of being like an old man and just kind of complaining about how the way how the world is and how it could be better right okay so this is a kind of device that were all becoming very accustomed with right a selfcheckout machine and im like you know what im a savvy im a savvy young man uh i can use these things i dont need to you know read instructions so i come up to this thing and you can see here i was buying uh this is a carpet shampoo and uh its an extension cable that detail is not important for this story okay so basically im like okay so i know how to use this thing like you just you know you know run the thing over and hit beep okay so i like pick up the thing and no beep and so im like okay thats kind of annoying so i see this sign says okay please press scanning to start beginning your transaction okay great and i looked at me okay please press start this is in canada so we need to have start in english and start in french i speak english primarily so i hit the start button and now im like okay good im good to go and i tried to do it again when i try to do it again it still doesnt work and then this is the moment where i decided to take a picture so you can see here that theres a sign here that says please press start scanning to begin your transaction so i have to press this button as well start scanning um and you might be saying hey didnt you already press start and the answer to that question is yes i press start two times i started twice before i was even allowed to start scanning this is again a minor hiccup but enough to kind of like you know make me annoyed right um so this is uh so the lesson here is that signs literally written signs uh and i think i said this earlier um are often a sign that the customer journey is unclear its not clear what a person should do about this ill show you one other example uh this is from a while back uh so signifiers in science can also be shapes of things ill play the video and just explain simply that uh this was me uh at i was on a date so i was trying to like you know you know make a good impression uh and uh she was yeah anyway so ill just play the video centered inside everythings good laughter so once again oh okay so actually that means that you need to use two hands to use this thing well actually you can push it with this you can push this here oh nobody can figure that out right okay good okay so when i said okay that was the moment that i realized she thinks im an income poop and im never going out with this woman again actually uh everything ended fine but for the purpose of this story the thing i want to point out is that this this thing is shaped in a in a convex way so it kind of it bubbles outwards and my argument here is that if it was bubbled inwards so sort of the shape of the indentation of a cup then it would have been much clearer how to use this thing okay and uh and and heres some other examples where its good here i just wanted to point out that you know sometimes weve all encountered this kind of thing where its like optin optout who knows what im trying to do um and the fact that theres a long description you know who knows what that means sometimes my argument is that we call these things dark patterns because theyre designed intentionally to mislead users so lots of interesting stuff in user experience design i know you might be thinking yourself look im not going to make that mistake but the thing is that you are typically not your user you have your own biases and blind spots and you are working on a team and so its important to learn about techniques that help you to kind of arrive at better designs theres a bunch of user experience and hci jobs that you can get out there and they have all sorts of different names so the typical joke is you can pick one of these things on the left column here and combine it with something on the right column and boom there you have some sort of user experience job right so you can be a usability analyst you could be a usability engineer or a developer you can be an interaction designer or usability interaction engineer so heres the quick summary of my 20 turn 30 minute talk design is everywhere objects that you use web systems that you make use of tools apps physical environments libraries signs in libraries reports that you build good design is hard its not easy poorly designed things have big consequences theyre annoying to use and when you learn good design practices as you would in a user experience design program you can help make better designs so heres a quick thing some contact info for me im happy to answer questions if you want to reach out uh and im definitely 10 minutes over my time so i apologize anastasia im happy to hand the baton over to you okay just give me a second can you see my screen okay um okay hello everyone um im anastasia and uh tony showed you a lot of examples of that design and the reason why we started started this session was this part because indeed its our highest priority right to learn how to avoid mistakes but another facet of our work is designing novel technology an understanding of what is needed so how to develop these truly new types of devices software and other technology often comes from academic research and so what i want to do today i want to give you a glimpse of how it might look like on the example of some of my work so im a researcher in hci as i mentioned earlier and my work in each day covers a rather broad range of research from development of different interaction techniques through creating multidevice ecosystems when we use different technology within it uh to informing architectural computer vision and so on and at some point i became fascinated by this idea that weve got two really intelligent uh powerful entities a human and a computer and what were trying to do were trying to put them together to make them uh talk to each other so that they can accomplish a richer set of tasks right and optimize what each is capable of and yet developing this communication between humans and computers um is uh really complicated and um it keeps being surprisingly challenging throughout our whole story of our field and if originally in 80s when hci was just starting um hcis field was mainly concerned with how to make computers so that humans can understand them then now especially with the development of machine intelligence the question is shifting to how to make humans and computers to understand each other and so on one hand it becomes more and more clear to all of us that our ability to create a partnership between humans and computers and integrate computers into natural communication is going to define what we as a society are going to be able to accomplish but on the other hand we learn again and again that building this successful communication even just between humans let alone humans and computers is very challenging so think about all the complaints we have heard during the last year and a half about the system supported communication and learning right for instance learning through zoom so in my work i study the mechanisms of this mediated communication and more specifically i explore this dynamic context that moderates mediates defines how we explore information how we share information how we perceive information in these different types of communication so why context and why information well because understanding what we as humans do and why we do it and understanding whats going on with us depends on understanding our current context so for machines to become for computers to become human collaborators in communication they need to learn how to understand and even reproduce this context and because communication in its core is an exchange of information the systems ability to work with people requires understanding of how why and when people share and dont share because no matter what systems performance depends on information and for the same information we as humans were ready to share or perceive it in one context and were completely against doing it in another context so uh today i want to talk to you about some of the aspects of this design for systems that aim to support this communication with uh both between uh humans uh right so human to human communication and human computer communication and um how to have these systems context aware so how to make them so that they can adapt their functionality and their behavior to the context and why it even matters so first lets think about what is communication and more specifically whats the difference between interaction and communication any thoughts its actually a very complicated question so im gonna just for the sake of time im just gonna jump in um towards the answer so if we think about what is interaction communication in both cases its an exchange of information between several parties right so its always an exchange of information there are always at least two parties involved but in fact communication is a sub type of interaction and interaction becomes communication when we start thinking that the other side has some capacity to act independently so when you start thinking that the other side can make its own choices you suddenly start communicating instead of just purely interacting so maybe you have seen those funny videos when um an elevator is a voice intro voice um operated and then elevator doesnt understand people and people started yelling at it talking to it saying that is you know making fun of them so that is the moment when you shift from interaction to communication and so now with the development of this machine machine uh intelligence with machines becoming this communication actor instead of just an interaction actor now we can view these systems as forming a continue from communicating through technology such as zoom for instance skype different social networks so when people interact to each other through this system to communicating around technology such as monitoring systems large multiuser displays collaborative software to communicating directly with technology such as different conversational agents robots and so on like alexa google assistant and so on and so in my research i look at how depending on the place on this continuum these systems have different contributions that they can make to the communication process and so that is how we inform design from the research perspective to the actual product design so lets first look at the interaction through these systems for example teleconference assistance or lets say social networks theyre designed to be a platform for communicating with other people but because this communication is mediated the users often dont have the full picture of who is on the other side so for instance who is reading our posts who can see and hear us on the screen lets say right now im on your screen i have no idea whos around you whats going on there i have no idea how youre reacting to what im saying right so i do not have this full picture and so since i do not have it uh and people do not have it we create something some kind of conceptualization of who is on the other side something that we call the imagined audiences and of course what we imagine is often very different from the reality and you could say so what why does it matter well it matters first of all because our imagined audiences so this these ideas of who is on the other side um determine how and what we communicate to the real people out there but it also defines our expectations on how the information is going to be used and perceived so you can think of all the uh issues around privacy about our sharing about misunderstandings and communication the efficiency of communication so all of that has to be supported by these systems and so because of that we show for instance in with my colleagues that the role of technologies through which this communication is happening so this technology is on the left side of the continuum the role becomes to gather this missing contextual information about the audience and to integrate it into the communication in a suitable way which doesnt necessarily mean of course to just spit it out to the user right no we need to be smart about it and we can develop different features um that would support this communication based on this contextual information for example online forums as one of the situations of communicating through the technology how can we integrate the missing information about the audience into the communication process here or for example we can present some information about the person right we can say how many posts they made with response to what message they are posting their answer right now we can show if they have some special status on this forum right for instance if they are an administrator or something like that so that is an example of how this information can be um embedded into the communication information that we can gather and then in bad in in in the process through the design in other examples on social media for instance when you can define uh who is going to see your post right or lets say stories in instagram you can see who watched it right but if you think about your experience of using these systems think about what doesnt really translate what is there when youre using lets say facebook that doesnt really that you would want to know about your audience but that is not supported through the design and lets say facebook researchers who are like more academic researchers thats thats the way how theyre thinking about these problems right they go there and they start exploring what else is that that is missing and based on that new features are bringing up same with zoom right for instance what were doing right now as i said lets say i have no idea whats going on with you right now there and even if everybody would have their videos on there is still a lot of this context about audience that is missing okay so when we communicate through the system the system needs to um together and integrate this information into communication and now if we move to the uh to the right on the continuum so to the middle we would find here the systems that are mainly announcing this ability of users to access and produce the information so these are the systems around which were communicating um so the examples of such systems can include for instance public displays right or digital tabletops and they provoke these spatial interactions around them or it can be software for instance um different like my report right or google docs that you share and so software provides the interactions around content that they provide or help us to create so what do you think matters in this case what should the technology be doing to support this type of communication so because these systems in the middle are mainly augmenting this ability to access and produce information their main role becomes to provide this information in the best most contextually suitable form and what exactly it means depends a little bit on the type of the system for example for the um lets say large displays right or some physical systems this includes being able to adopt for lets say collaborative or competitive scenarios right or adopt for it for the um uh territoriality and praxamics around uh around the device so proximix is a uh field of the study that is concerned with um the the way how people organize their space their territory in the term was suggested and the field was started by edward hall who was a cultural anthropologist and what he suggested is that there this four circles that exist around people and the closest one is this intimate space then personal space then social space and then public space and depending on your relationship with people youre going to be standing on the on the appropriate distance between yourself so why is it why why why does it matter to us well for example when youre presenting information to the situation like lets say to an intimate couple right or to family you can support this more intimate interaction distance between people but lets say for the work situation you have to present information so that it would be would be within these appropriate distances as well right with software uh so thats for physical systems with software things become slightly more complicated but lets look at the example of um software for cowatching movies and videos so in this case people are communicating here around the content that this software provides right so what do these systems do to provide information in a suitable format any ideas anything goes on top right what what do you mean on top overlay on top yeah so the fact that the the chat is on the side right so the focus is only on the main content for sure you can see for instance here who paused the video right if so if somebody stops the video it stops for everyone um if uh so so the fact that chat is on the side yeah so that that the content is is on the left so there are a lot of aspects within it but you see here were not focusing as lets say in the forums on providing this information about the audience instead were focusing on the action right and were providing information in the form in this suitable form okay so so far we have discussed that when we interact through this system this system should be gathering and integrating this missing context into the communication when we interact around technologies their role is to understand this context and provide the information in contextual suitable format and now lets look at what is happening when the interaction is taking place communication is taking place with the technology itself and so these systems on the right end of the spectrum are built around the idea of intelligent agents and this includes for instance chatbots voice activated assistants different types of robots social drones and so on and since the communication here happens with this intelligent agent the systems tend to be heavily anthropomorphized what is entropization its when we start attributing life like humanlike qualities to something that is not actually a life and in fact that is an evolutionary adaptation that is something that happens naturally mindlessly with people and that helps us to make sense of something that is complex right so that is the true moment when were moving to the communication with the computer system from the pure interaction that is the moment when a computer stops being a pure tool and becomes a communication actor so how do you think it would affect the role and responsibility in this collaboration with humans well arguably the the responsibility of this technology is done to be a good communicator right to be a good communicator part department which includes both this ability to recognize this users communication context and to match this context in communication with the user so from the system development perspective its two different sites one thing is to understand whats going on and another thing is to reproduce this context in communication and this i will show you on the example of one of my studies with conversational agents to show you how this academic research can can inform the actual product design so the general purpose voice assistance such as alexa google assistant or siri for example theyre becoming more and more popular as you might know and so more and more users are interacting with them on a daily basis and these systems in essence rely on users voice interactions with a persona for an agent who is deliberately designed to speak and act humanlike and because of this the voice assistants end up being integrated in both technological space of the users life so the ecosystem of devices in their life and at the same time in their social space so with whom our users communicate on a daily basis and so they tend to be antropomorphized right so again people start attributing this life like qualities and traits to these agents for example users flirt with them which in fact became so common that now in popular media people joke and make movies about it so maybe youve seen there was a movie called her or there was an episode on the big bang theory at some point about that or as on this image on this side right now hey siri siri says we need to talk who is this alexa person you keep flirting with right so it became a really a real social thing and you could say well thats cute but so what why does it matter to us well it matters because entrepreneurization and these processes heavily define the interaction style so how we talk to this system and also users expectations trust into the system and even use cases with this technology when people adopt these systems and yet we know very little about what happens when entrepreneurization occurs right so do we see lets say all agents um as the same type of a person in this case well intuitively probably not right but if not does it depend on us how we perceive them or on the design of the agent so lets say would it differ between how i perceive the same agent than you right would it depend on the user or would we perceive the same age in the same way right so we didnt know that before and so what we did know before is that when we talk about entrepreneurialization there are kind of two sides to it one side is that um there is this behavioral design so that is emotional responsiveness the way how whose robots for instance the way they move now how warm they are in their interactions their personality and so on and on the other side there is this physical or visual aspects of it so lets say facial expressions or body expressions so your roomba vacuum would have only behavioral traits only the way it moves and then your like a box sculpture for instance would have only visual ones and so by design of course voice assistants are capable of displaying mainly these behavioral aspects right the way how how they act and talk to you but what personality and behavioral aspects what aspects of this of this talking matter to users and is there any structure there do we think about them in the same way or no and so we thought that if there is any structure there then these perceptions should be consistently different for different agents right so lets ask a lot of people about how they perceive that several agents and see whether their parents there and we also thought that if there is some structure there then the way how people think about this personality of an agent would also define how they visual how users visualize these agents so how users think these agents would look like if they were humans and especially because agents um answer can include some visual references like for instance series id blush if i could right or i think it was googles i would hug you if i if i would have hands right so then uh if there are consistent differences with the way how they act then there should be consistent differences with the way how they are visualized as well and the only way how we can could look at it was to look to compare several uh agents so we took three agents alexa google home and siri and we first asked people to interact with them um to talk for a little bit and then we interviewed people so we talked to the to the participants and we asked them what are the like if these agents would be humans what would they be like what are their definitive characteristics and then as a third step we also ask people to create these visualizations for each of the agent so what did we learn there so the main highlight about the the perception of the character is that they indeed structured these perceptions and theyre structured according uh five categories um of personality approachability sentiment towards the user professionalism intelligence and individuality so all of us think about agents in terms of these five five categories and its indeed different for different ages so for example with approachability thats about how emotionally distant or approachable an agent is right and the distance and here includes agents being snarky closed off and often theyre um given in the opposition of users willingness to engage with this agent and then the other side the approachable side is is agents being emotionally warm friendly willing to interact like feeling more like a friend being outgoing and chill another example here this sentiment towards a user thats about how genuine versus disingenuous an agent is towards a user and the genuine side is this being benevolent caring altruistic thoughtful really trying to help you and disingenuous side is this being inconsiderate indifferent for example pretending or about siri one of the participants said using her sas as a defense mechanism and so these behavioral perceptions are both structured along these five dimensions and are different for different agents and then we also looked at the visual perceptions and so we combined these visualizations into collages and we also created a cumulative visualization for each agent and you can see already on the slide that they are quite different for uh different agents and so we again identified there five different themes where these differences appear and for example um people were talking about the build like the physical built mainly about the height of an age and people were talking about the age so lets say alexa is generally perceived to be older and siri is perceived to be younger they have different facial expressions like lets say google seems stressed and theyve got a lot of stuff and alexa is just maybe a little bit smiling and siri would be smiling a lot uh and then they also have different different clothing right and siri would have this daring personality was highlighted femininity so she would be wearing crop tops mini skirts heels google would have this stereotypically awkward persona and alexa would have this cozy and caring carrying a character with big sweaters warm like jeans running shoes and so on and so the cool thing about this study was that it showed us that indeed there is something in the design of these agents that defined this very very um consistent structure of our perception about them and so we found that in the design itself it was first of all the amount of information that this agents provide and the level of details there um also the interaction style of an agent so whether its prompting you back um and how responsive it is to your prompts whether its using jokes and the third part there was the voice characteristics itself right so in this case we can see that there are very few design aspects that then produce such a diverse perception of this agency and so they they attacked both behavioral perceptions and visual perceptions of this agent and so the main takeaway from this study and for the design is that first of all theres this extremely rich socially meaningful interpretation that comes from users uh interpretation of actions of this agent right and a lot of these interpretations are very um biased so there is a lot of social stereotyping that is happening there but the good news is that these stereotypes and these perceptions theyre consistently dependent on particular elements of the system on particular design which gives us as design as technology designers a stable gateway to these perceptions as we develop voice based artificial agents and with that this is the summary slide of my of my talk um did i did i make it i almost made it um on time so we still have about three minutes for talks for a question sorry if you have any questions for uh tony or for myself would be happy to to answer thank you great stuff anastasia thank you uh glad that at least one of us kept the time so you were awesome kudos so as anastasia said we are more than happy to answer questions for a minute or two i do need to hop off myself at 1 15 so wont be here a whole lot longer music if just pause a bit i uh just posted the link back to the infocon program so uh following our session theres a 15 minute break and uh then the next session happens at the bottom of the hour there so you know sorry good morning good afternoon good evening wherever youre coming in from um the next session will be a session called leave from wherever you are skills for an evolving profession uh and so thats going to be given by miriam burgos marion philadelphia harris smith chris stewart all from the university of southern california um im not seeing questions uh so im just gonna you know what give everybody back two minutes of their day ive just posted there a link to the program my contact information anastasias contact information yes except that you included there my website which is right now um outdated for a couple years so i actually do have a new website um which is going to be posted at the same address soon so but please feel free to send me an email to reach out and i would be happy to join all right thank you very
