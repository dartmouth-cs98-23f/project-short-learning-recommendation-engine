aspects of this world arise not from individual humans but from the interaction of human beings youve done a lot of work in game theory first can you say what is game theory and how does help us model and study yeah game theory of course let us give credit where its due they dont comes from the economist first and foremost but as id mentioned before like you know computer scientists never hesitate to wander into other peoples turf and so there is now this 20 year old field called algorithmic game theory but you know game game theory first and foremost is a mathematical framework for reasoning about collective outcomes in systems of interacting individuals you know so you need at least two people to get started in game theory and many people are probably familiar with prisoners dilemma as kind of a classic example of game theory and a classic example where everybody looking out for their own individual interests leads to a collective outcome thats kind of worse for everybody then what might be possible if they cooperate it for example but cooperation is not an equilibrium in prisoners dilemma and so my work and the field of algorithmic game theory more generally in these areas kind of looks at settings in which the number of actors is potentially extraordinarily large and their incentives might be quite complicated and kind of hard to model directly but you still want kind of algorithmic ways of kind of predicting what will happen or influencing what will happen in the design of platforms so what to you is the most beautiful idea that youve encountered in game theory theres a lot of them im a big fan of the field i mean you know i mean technical answers to that of course would include nashs work just establishing that you know there theres a competitive equilibrium under very very general circumstance which in many ways kind of put the field on a firm conceptual footing because if you dont have equilibria its kind of hard to ever reason about what might happen since you know theres just no stability so just the idea that stability can emerge when theres multiple who or that it means not that it will necessarily emerge just that its possible right its like the existence of equilibrium doesnt mean that sort of natural iterative behavior will necessarily lead to it in the real world yeah maybe answering a slightly less personally than you asked the question i think within the field of algorithmic game theory perhaps the single most important kind of technical contribution thats been made is the real the the realization between close connections between machine learning and game theory and in particular between game theory and the branch of machine learning thats known as no regret learning and and this sort of provides a freight a very general framework in which a bunch of players interacting in a game or a system each one kind of doing something thats in their selfinterest will actually kind of reach an equilibrium and actually reach an equilibrium in a you know a pretty you know a rather you know short amount of steps so you kind of mentioned acting greedily can somehow end up pretty good for everybody or pretty bad or pretty bad it will end up stable yeah right and you know stability or equilibrium by itself is not that is not necessarily either a good thing or a bad thing so whats the connection between machine learning and the ideas well if we kind of talked about these ideas already in in kind of a nontechnical way which is maybe the more interesting way of understanding them first which is you know we have many systems platforms and apps these days that work really hard to use our data and the data of everybody else on the platform to selfishly optimize on behalf of each user okay so you know let me let me give what the cleanest example which is just driving apps navigation apps like you know google maps and ways where you know miraculously compared to when i was growing up at least you know the objective would be the same when you wanted to drive from point a to point b spend the least time driving not necessarily minimize the distance but minimize the time right and when i was growing up like the only resources you had to do that were like maps in the car which literally just told you what roads were available and then you might have like half hourly traffic reports just about the major freeways but not about side roads so you were pretty much on your own and now weve got these apps you pull it out and you say i want to go from point a to point b and in response kind of to what everybody else is doing if you like what all the other players in this game are doing right now heres the the you know the the route that minimizes your driving time so it is really kind of computing a selfish best response for each of us in response to what all of the rest of us are doing at any given moment and so you know i think its quite fair to think of these apps as driving or nudging us all towards the competitive or nash equilibrium of that game now you might ask like well that sounds great why is that a bad thing well you know its its known both in theory and with some limited studies from actual like traffic data that all of us being in this competitive equilibrium might cause our collective driving time to be higher may be significantly higher than it would be under other solutions and then you have to talk about what those other solutions might be and what what the algorithms to implement them are which we do discuss in the kind of game theory chapter of the book but but similarly you know on social media platforms or on amazon you know all these algorithms that are essentially trying to optimize our behalf theyre driving us in a colloquial sense towards some kind of competitive equilibrium and you know one of the most important lessons of game theory is that just because were at equilibrium doesnt mean that theres not a solution in which some or maybe even all of us might be better off and then the connection to machine learning of course is that in all these platforms ive mentioned the optimization that theyre doing on our behalf is driven by machine learning you know like predicting where the traffic will be predicting what products im gonna like predicting what would make me happy in my newsfeed you
