processing systems a brief overview so were going to take a look at the two classifications of these types of transaction processing systems side by side so firstly is webbased where the storage location of the database file is accessed by the internet in order to connect to a server so you need to be connected to the internet if youre going to access this system and thats how youll get to the server there probably are areas on site too where you can access the actual server as well but predominantly it has internet connection and thus users from over the world could connect to this actual webbased tps on the flip side a nonwebbased tps means that the database file is stored locally on the system or more so accessed through a local area network to a specific server so it can be on a network just the network is not on the internet to connect to that server youve got to have some sort of land set up with wired or wireless mediums and hardware set up to connect you to that server so its more of a private network so if we look at this visually on the webbased side we have our computer we need to connect the internet and through the internet we can connect to a server whereas with the nonwebbased tps ive got my system and it connects to the server through the network makeup that im using so lets look at the advantages and disadvantages of webbased and look the big advantage of this is the systems database can be accessed from all over the world through the internet and this is great if youve got a commercial business that youre working with because you could have customers all over the world accessing a site signing up to it and entering their own details in order to become a part of your service and they can all do that through the internet and youre going to see access is everything really with the difference between webbased and nonwebbased because on the disadvantaged side of things its prone to a higher security risk due to the internet technologies youve got more entry points through the internet for hackers to get into the system so thats a disadvantage of it there also access is dependent on the internet being online so if the internet does go down we cant access the actual network if were working from home or whatever especially if im a participant of this system and i need to use the internet to get through to it in order to do my work for the company im with on the flip side for the nonwebbased tps the advantages are the higher security due to the limited access to the actual server okay because it is within a private network there is more control there of course theres always ways to get in but it doesnt have a global access as is the case with a webbased tps which works to its favor in relation to security okay but then on the disadvantaged side of things you need to be within the side of the network in order to access the actual system alright so youve got to be within that lan okay or a private when in order to get into that system okay in order to access the server you cant be accessing it from home because at home you are not near the place of works system so its not possible there so i hope this gives you just an idea of the differences between the two types of categories of webbased and nonwebbased tpss and essentially it all comes down to the internet one you can use the internet to get into the system the other its more likely a private network
