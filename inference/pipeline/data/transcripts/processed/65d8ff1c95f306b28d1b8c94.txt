computing is and what makes it special but as   a developer im sure you want to know how to  actually write a piece of code that would run   on a common computer but before we dive into  that lets just do a little bit of a quick   recap instead of the classical bits of 0s and 1s  quantum computers use qubits a qubit can be a 0   a 1 or any linear combination of the two  and that is what we called a superposition   we can also entangle multiple qubits so their states become strongly correlated in order   to change the states of qubits we apply  a series of gates similar to the classical   logic gates and in the end we want to measure  these qubits so we can get the results   so how do we take all these concepts into  code and the answer is simple we use a   quantum software development kit in  this video we will be using qiskit   which is the most widely used quantum sdk today   qiskit is based on python which is fairly simple  to learn even if youve never used it before   so lets write a simple program in his qiskit in this program we will use two qubits   we will put one into superposition entangle it with the other and then   do a measurement of both of them and  of course all that is done using gates   so lets start by importing quantum circuit from  qiskit we then can create a quantum circuit  with two quantum registers  and two classical registers   the quantum registers are used for quantum   computation one for each qubit and the classical  registers are used to store the measured results   we need a classical registers because  even though the physical world is quantum   the majority of the classical  world is still classical   and the classical registers allow us to bring  quantum information back into the classical world   so the next thing we want to do is  apply some gates and in this program   were going to apply two gates the  first one is the hadamard gate  on qubit 0 the hadamard gate puts  the qubit into a superposition between 0   and 1 that means it now has an equal  chance of being measured a 0 or 1   the next gate we need is the control  not gate or cx for short   the control not gate is a conditional two qubits gate it has a control qubit and the target qubit without superposition the control  not gate is fairly simple to understand   that is it is as if the state of the control qubit is  1 then you flip the state of the target qubit   and thats why its called control not   and because the states of least two  qubits are now strongly correlated   we now say they are entangled so the  last thing we want to do is actually do   measurements so we can get the outputs and we  do this by calling the measure all function   and there you have it we just wrote a simple  quantum program using qiskit now if you take   this program and run it a bunch of times on an  ideal quantum computer youll find out that   theres a 50 chance of the outputs being 00 and  50 chance of it being 11 but you would never   be a 01 or 10 the 5050 of the first  qubit comes from the superposition and while   we didnt explicitly change the state of the  second qubit it got changed anyway because   it is entangled with the first qubit  so it changes with the first qubit   so in this program we created a quantum  circuit which operates at the same level   as classical assembly language and allows you  to efficiently manipulate the qubits directly   however if youre not fond of  playing with low level circuits   qiskit also offers a number of higher  level algorithms for example qiskit has   a package focusing on machine learning that has  a number of prebuilt classes you can take a   quantum kernel class use it to train and test  data you can then take this trained quantum   kernel and pass it into a classical algorithm  such as the support vector classification   from scikitlearn then you can then  accelerate your classical application   thanks for watching if you have any questions  please leave them in the comments below   also please remember to like this  video and subscribe to our channel   so we can continue to bring you  content that matters to you
