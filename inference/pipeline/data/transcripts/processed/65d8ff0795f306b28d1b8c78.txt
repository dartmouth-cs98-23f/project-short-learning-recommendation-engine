but what is it really quantum computers can process information at speeds that are faster than traditional computers making them capable of performing calculations that would take billions of years on a conventional machine but theres more watch the whole video folks you will know everything about the fascinating world of quantum computing and how this cuttingedge technology could impact the development of artificial intelligence lets get started so what is quantum computing quantum computing is about using the principles of quantum theory which describes the behavior of energy and matter at the atomic and subatomic levels to develop a new type of computing you know rather than relying on traditional binary encoding where bits can either be zero or one quantum computing harnesses the properties of subatomic particles such as electrons or photons to operate with quantum bits or cubits these cubits possess the remarkable ability to exist in multiple states states simultaneously essentially embodying both one and zero concurrently unlike classical computers that encode information through a binary system of electrical impulses quantum computing exploits phenomena in quantum physics to revolutionize computation cubits the fundamental units of quantum computing define the binary constraints of classical bits enabling to inhabit multidimensional states consequently the computational power of quantum computers scales exponentially with the addition of more cubits far surpassing the linear growth of classical computers as they increase in bit capacity the inception of quantum computing dates back to the 1980s when researchers discovered that certain computational challenges could be more efficiently addressed using quantum algorithms than classical methods this cutting edge technology holds immense potential in navigating vast arrays of possibilities to discern solutions to complex problems now at the heart of quantum computings incredible power lie two fundamental principles from quantum physics superposition and entanglement superposition enables cubits to hold quantum information in a state encompassing all possible configurations simultaneously paving the way for the creation of intricate multidimensional computational spaces think of flipping a coin in our world its either heads or tails once it lands but in quantum superposition its as if the coin is spinning in the air both heads and tails at once until you check this means a quantum computer can consider multiple outcomes at the same time vastly speeding up its ability to solve complex problems entanglement on the other hand allows pairs of cubits to become interconnected in such a manner that the state of one cubit directly influences the state of the other facilitating predictable correlations between them by harnessing superposition cubits can explore a multitude of potential solutions at the same time vastly expanding the computational landscape furthermore entanglement empowers quantum algorithms to tackle complex problems by exploiting the interconnectedness between cubits leading to exponential enhancements in computing power and efficiency in contrast to classical computers where increasing bit capacity yields incremental improvements in processing power the addition of cubits to a quantum computer results in exponential advancements in computational capacity adding to that you should also know that classical computers excel at everyday tasks with minimal error rates while quantum computers offer unparallel capabilities for complex tasks like simulations data analysis such as chemical or drug trials and designing energy efficient batteries albeit with higher error rates you know unlike classical computers which typically require basic cooling mechanisms like internal fans quantum processors demand meticulous protection from even the slightest vibrations and must operate at extremely low temperatures using super cooled super fluids interestingly in a landmark achievement in 2019 google was able to prove that a quantum computer could solve a problem within minutes that would take a classical computer 10000 years to solve
