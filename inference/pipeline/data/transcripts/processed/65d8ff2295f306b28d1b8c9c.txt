things thatll supposedly fix climate change but wont such as hydrogen veganism or quantum computing wait what yes marketing quantum computers as a miracle cure for climate change has not fallen out of fashion despite my many jokes about it for example in a recent article in the hill sam how a research associate at the center for new american security in washington dc writes if countries are serious about climate change they should get serious about quantum computing right if we put all our money into quantum computing therell be none left for oil problem solved but quantum computing hype isnt new and this is supposed to be science news so let me tell you whats new new is that jan lur the ai chief of meta has a surprisingly sane attitude to quantum computing this deserve celebration and also investigation because hes making a very good point according to a recent report by cnbc he said that the practical relevance of quantum computers is unclear and that many of the problems you can solve with quantum computing you can solve way more efficiently with classical computers and that quantum computing has got such a longtime horizon that its irrelevant to what theyre doing at meta i found this to be very interesting because it draws attention to the competition between artificial intelligence and quantum compu shooting thats becoming increasingly noticeable and that might just be the final nail in the coffin that is commercial interest in quantum computing i thought it would be worth looking at this a bit closer and explaining what i believe he meant you see quantum computing is extremely exciting from the research perspective because its completely uncharted territory weve never used such big quantum things before but getting commercially relevant results out of quantum computers is another thing entirely not only do you need the computers to be big enough and still stable enough to maintain the fragile quantum states you then also need to demonstrate that they can do something better than a conventional computer and this requires two things first youll need an algorithm that can run on the quantum computer that has a computational advantage over a conventional computer for some sort of interesting problem and second youll have to show that in reality itll actually come out faster the best understood quantum algorithms are those for certain problems in quantum chemistry thats basically material science some problems in logistics and finance and some sorts of code cracking its a rather limited class of problems of course the companies who want answers to these problems already have pretty good algorithms on conventional computers and these are now further improving with artificial intelligence which is why the current ai boom is bad news for quantum computing but how is this even relevant if quantum computers are supposedly unbeatably fast its because of what gives them their advantage quantum computers work with quantum bits cuits for short and derive their advantage from the many ways you can correlate or entangle those cubits but its not that operating the cubits themselves is fast indeed operating cubits is usually slower than doing operations on a conventional computer keep in mind that modern computers operate in the gigahertz range or above thats more than a billion operations a second how fast you can operate cubits depends on the type of cubits but for superconducting circuits its maybe 10 million per second optimistically and iron traps are much slower still and that doesnt take into account the need for error correction which will make them even slower the reason people are excited about quantum computers is not because theyre fast per operation but because they need fewer operations to get the same result so you see if you have a small calculation on a conventional computer one that requires fewer operations it will beat the quantum computer because the conventional computer is faster per operation if you increase the size of the problem then both the conventional computer and the quantum computer will need more operations and so more time but for the quantum algorithm the number of operations increases less with the size of the problem so the idea is that regardless of how slow the cubits are eventually the quantum computer outperform the conventional computer because it needs fewer operations thats the theory in practice the question is where this crossover happens where the quantum computer starts to outperform the conventional one thats a moving target because each time conventional computers become faster or someone comes up with a better algorithm the point where quantum computers finally win moves further away to a higher number of cubits and this is why artificial intelligence is becoming a problem for quantum computing because artificial intelligence lets you get more out of conventional computers and the number of cubits at which quantum computers will bring an advantage might eventually become so large that it becomes impractical or just prohibitively expensive to even use them though its a shame that meta isnt more into quantum computing id really like to have a button thats thumbs up and down at the same time did you know i have a quantum mechanics course on brilliantorg its a beginners course that you can take without any background knowledge itll introduce you to topics such as interference superpositions and entanglement the uncertainty principle and bals theorem and and afterwards you can continue learning more about your
