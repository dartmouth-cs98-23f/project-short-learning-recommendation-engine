lecture of computer organization and architecture so today we will be learning about computer architecture in a bit details so lets get to learning lets start with the formal definition of computer architecture so its basically the design of computers including their instructions its hardware components and system organization now it has got two parts first the instruction set architecture which includes the specification that determine how machine language programs will interact with the computer next we have the hardware system architecture which deals with the computers major hardware subsystems like cpu storage input output etc it includes both the logical design and the data flow organization of the subsystems and hence determines their efficiency lets try and understand this concept with the help of an illustration suppose we want to add two values 2 and 3 and store the added value in a variable named x now this simplification can be performed in various ways based on the available hardware these are some examples of the different ways the simplification can be performed now from these one or more ways can be selected for a specific type of computer this c is nothing but the isa suppose this one is selected so all the other operations will also have similar type of instructions now based on this the hardware will be chosen as in this specific case we will need at least two different memory locations and an added circuit it is the rudimentary concept of hardware system architecture or the hsa now its really important to distinguish a computers architecture from its implementation i hope it was also clear from our previous discussion that the implementation is the realization of computer in hardware and includes the choice of technology speed cost and so on whereas the architecture doesnt really define an implementation yet they both influence one another generally computers with the same isa will run the same kind of programs and are also said to belong to the same family this concept will be more clear as we progress eventually now we will move on to the classifications of computer architecture but before diving straight into it a bit of a history lesson is required so that we can properly understand various nomenclatures now we already know that computer architecture is the design of computers and the great great great ancestor of todays ultramodern computing devices was the analytical engine it was the first proposed mechanical general purpose computer designed by the great computer pioneer charles babbage he was assisted by lady ada lovelace who was the first one to come up with the basic idea of having a language in order to operate the proposed machine so all the ladies out there more power to you if it was not for lady lovelace we wouldnt be enjoying the luxury of software today and just an fyi lady loveless was tutored by d d morgan augustus de morgan whose de morgans law brought revolution to the world of boolean algebra of george bull we all know about that right then comes the next big milestone the advent of computability and noncomputability alan turing figured it out which problems can be solved using computers he has widely been considered as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence since then now alongside turing another name is very frequently associated with computation and it is johan von neumann or more popularly known as john von neumann this very hungarian genius was not only a child prodigy who could divide an eightdigit number by another eightdigit number within just a fraction of second when he was just about 6 years old but also the great mathematician who grabbed the fulltime professor position at princeton university by the age probably 30 yes you heard me right not a reader not a lecturer but a fulltime professor by the age of 30 funny story neumann even offered turing for research assistantship under his supervision quantum mechanics at the institute of advanced studies where only the greatest of minds were invited to work also after the second world war newman brought together gems from around the world to work as a team in the advancement of computation alright enough with the history for now lets get to know about why we are so much interested about this marvelous character john von neumann you remember this typical block diagram of computer from our previous session right well this is the person behind it this architecture is named also after him and known as von neumann architecture so to conclude i would like to quote another genius professor david brailsford of university of nottingham who has been teaching computer science for more than 50 years now and i believe no one could explain this in a better way he says if turing is the father and babbage was the grandfather and if lady ada countess of loveless was the great aunt then john von neumann was the impossibly talented impossibly charismatic very wealthy uncle to computing alright people that will be all for this session and im pretty confident that we all are now ready for the next session where we dive straight into the various classifications of computer architecture see you in the next one thank you all for watching applause music you
