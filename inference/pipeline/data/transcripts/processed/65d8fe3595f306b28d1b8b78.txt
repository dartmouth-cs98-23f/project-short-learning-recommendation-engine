from stanford university one fine day he receives a mail from star trek technologies for an interview for the designation of a software engineer as referred by the university alex was really happy and excited about this and starts preparing for his interview next week while he was preparing alex came across the term downtime alex has no idea what is a downtime he decided to seek help from his uncle john a software engineer john explained that downtime is a specific time frame allocated to deploy or update changes for a software product in a realtime environment and this happens because most of the softwares we use today are developed using the waterfall model for example cisco one of the popular leaders in it and networking globally is using agile methodology for their subscription billing platform sbp as it was originally developed using the waterfall model after adopting the agile methodology ciscos product improved its overall efficiency where defects were reduced by 40 percent compared to the previous releases and effect removal efficiency increased by 14 percent upon explaining what downtime is john further added that downtime is a small part of the waterfall model it is the traditional way of developing softwares using a software development life cycle where the whole product is treated as one single unit and the development of one phase starts only after the completion of the previous phase adding new features or updating the existing feature in a waterfall model based product needs a specific time frame known as downtime to avoid disturbance in the workflow of an organization where applying changes in a waterfallbased product might produce irrelevant results or product failure the waterfall model is the earliest or the traditional model used for software development where the output of one phase acts as the input for the preceding phase consisting of a series of steps where each phase has specific deliverables that act as the input for the next phase as it avoids overlapping a basis as these phases are dependent on each other this method is simple and easy to understand where prerequisites are preknown documented earlier and technology remains static where there is no need for ambiguous requirements due to the delay in software delivery in contrast the final version is available only after completing the entire software lifecycle process with any deviations if available changes in the waterfall model contain high risk as changes include a new revised version of the entire software running the entire series of steps again and again for example a tap and pay machine where the machine first validates whether the customers account is funded with sufficient funds or not and then initiates the transaction for money transfer unless the validation is processed the transaction cannot be initiated alex was curious and asked uncle john is there any way to overcome the drawbacks of the waterfall model john replies yes agile methodology was introduced to overcome the problems faced in the waterfall model where agile based products are developed by breaking the entire product process into microservices or phases which is faster to execute and deploy changes on the go there is no need to worry about other or previous tasks while working on one particular phase avoiding product failure agile based products dont require any particular time frame downtime to deploy changes unlike the waterfall model where the whole product is treated as one single unit and each process is dependent on the preceding processes where deploying changes leads to downtime how agile products are developed agile based products are developed using the agile life cycle at first the developed product is implemented in an actual working environment for reviews from clients and stakeholders to check its deliverables and functionality after client reviews the official product is launched in a realtime working environment where agile methodology focuses on satisfying the consumer needs by efficiently utilizing the resources and avoiding additional risks or deviations in the product for example providing a trial beta version of the software for the end user to experience the software towards its deliverables and results will be helpful in refining and reviewing the product like adobe photoshop adobe illustrator etc after understanding all about agile methodology alex asks uncle john for companies implementing agile in their workspace nowadays john replies yes companies are moving towards agile methodology due to its flexibility and advantages over traditional systems by adopting agile for their sony interactive environment sony noticed a major difference where there was a reduced planning time by 28 with their framework and downtime was reduced to the maximum which made the company save 30 million dollars a year so heres a question for you what makes agile different from waterfall model a it is dependent on microservices b agile consumes more time c the process is broken down into several phases d none of the above please give it a thought and post your answers in the comments section below three lucky winners will receive amazon gift vouchers agile methodology aims to meet the consumers requirements to the maximum in deploying changes in a rapidly developing environment where agile manifesto principles brings an innovative set of rules and protocols to help developers overcome the challenges faced in the traditional practices waterfall model making agile flexible and efficient we hope you
