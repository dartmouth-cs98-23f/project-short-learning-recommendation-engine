want to learn more about what they are this video is for you welcome back to our channel im megan from mongodbs developer relations team here at mongodb we talk a lot about nosql databases because thats what we are but what does that even mean nosql is technically an umbrella term for any alternative system to traditional sql databases nosql databases use a data model that has a different structure than the rows and columns table structure used with rdbms now within nosql databases there are actually four types document databases key value stores column oriented databases and graph databases lets talk about each of these in a little more detail first up weve got document databases a document database like mongodb for example stores data in a json or bson format you can access store and retrieve documents from your database in a form that is much closer to the data objects used in applications this means that less translation is required to use and access data in an application document databases are popular with developers because they offer the flexibility to rework their document structures as needed to better suit their applications in sql databases however intervention by database administrators may be required to change the structure of a database next we have key value stores and this is the simplest type of nosql database every element is stored as a key value pair consisting of an attribute name or the key and a value this database is like an rdbms with two columns the attribute name such as state and the value such as alaska third we have column oriented databases while an rdbms stores data in rows and reads it row by row column oriented databases are organized as a set of columns when you want to run analytics on a small number of columns in a database you can read those columns directly without consuming memory with unwanted data finally we have graph databases a graph database focuses on the relationship between data elements each element is contained as an node the connections between elements in a database are called links or relationships connections are first class elements of the database stored directly these databases are diverse in their data formats and applications furthermore systems store data in different ways these differ from rdbms in that they can be schema agnostic which allows unstructured and semistructured data in a network to be stored and processed this was just the tip of the iceberg and weve got a whole lot more where that came from in the description below were leaving a few more links to other videos and articles that you might find helpful if youre still here its because you found this video valuable and wed be very grateful if you could give it a thumbs up if you havent already be sure to subscribe to our channel so you never miss our content and well see you next time
