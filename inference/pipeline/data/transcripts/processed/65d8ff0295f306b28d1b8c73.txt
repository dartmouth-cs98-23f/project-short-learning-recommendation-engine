doing science news its so that you can fully appreciate the drama of scientific discovery in which one result contradicts a previous one and the next one finds a flaw in this other one i think the entertainment value of science is greatly underappreciated and quantum computing is without doubt one of the most dramatic areas at the moment on the one hand you have people claiming its the next in industrial revolution and its going to change the world and on the other hand you have people saying its all hype quantum computers are interesting but useless this new paper supports the letter camp lets have a look quantum computers are devices that exploit quantum links known as entanglement and know thats not what einstein meant by spooky action at a distance entanglement doesnt exist in conventional computers and because quantum computers have these additional ways to encode and handle information they can perform some calculations much faster the relevant part of the previous sentence is that they can perform some calculations much faster it isnt the case for all calculations nevertheless the calculations that quantum computers can speed up cover several commercially relevant cases such as quantum chemistry that plays a role in material design and drug development as well as logistics and finance this is why there are so much hype around quantum computers and that talk about a new revolution on the other hand there are a lot of practical problems in making quantum computers work i mean besides the problem that no one understands quantum mechanics though theres that the real issue is that these quantum links are incredibly fragile depending on how you create them they might last micros seconds to a few seconds but thats about it and your calculation needs to be done within that time and i mean i do calculations for my financial management within a few microseconds but its probably not a good thing there are many approaches to quantum computing that differ by how you physically realize the quantum bits cubits for short ive talked about this in several previous episodes but all these approaches have this problem in common the quantum information is very sensitive to disturbances which brings in errors these errors can be avoided by introducing redundancies but that requires making the computers larger which brings in more problems what this means is that the need for error correction moves useful quantum computers further into the future and no one knows how far thats unappealing for investors and this is why in the past year some physicists like for example john presco have pushed the idea that even noisy quantum computers can be good for something if that was true it would do a lot against the criticism that quantum computing applications are far away and might remain far away forever last summer ibm said theyd done it theyd done something useful with a noisy quantum computer and the new york times celebrated this success the new paper now puts the the ibm achievement into doubt so h you see the drama in last years paper the ibm team explains how they used a noisy quantum processor with 127 cubits called the eagle processor to calculate whats called theorized time evolution of a 2d transverse fi ising model the ising model is a model of coupled quantum spins and the terized transverse field and means its a special version this model is interesting if you find that kind of model interesting to my best knowledge it doesnt have any uses however the type of calculation is difficult to do on a conventional computer which is what makes it an interesting test the ibm group claimed that their quantum chip outperformed any calculation that could be done on a conventional computer and that quote there is indeed merit to pursuing research towards deriving a practical computational advantage from noise limited quantum circuits the authors of the new paper now say that ibm was somewhat over optimistic they found a way to do the calculation on a conventional computer and they managed to do it faster and better than ibm could on their noisy computer basically they show that conventional computers outperform the quantum computer also on this task they write we can perform a classical simulation that significantly more accurate and precise than the results obtained from the quantum processor you can see this very nicely in this figure where the dots with the arrow bars are from the quantum computer and the smooth line going through them is from the new calculation so another supposed quantum achievement gun thats happened a few times before that one group claimed theyd done something spectacular on a quantum computer just that later another group did it on a conventional computer the most prominent example was probably googles 2019 claim that they had proved a quantum advantage back then the scientists from google published a paper in nature claiming theyd done a calculation on a 53 cubit quantum computer which would have taken 10000 years on a conventional computer the 10000 years claim was swiftly questioned by ibm and indeed it was later done by chinese group on a conventional computer in only 5 minutes then again maybe that just means that 10000 years in silicon valley are worth 5 minutes in china this new result matters because its once again showing that conventional computers are so advanced already that there are very strong competition for quantum computers and thatll probably remain so for quite some time to come this is really bad news for anyone who has invested into quantum computing did you know i have a quantum mechanic course on brilliantorg its a beginners course that you can take without any background knowledge itll introduce you to topics
