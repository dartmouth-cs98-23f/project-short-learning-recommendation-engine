scott aaronson well i wanted to create my own video games originally as a kid so my advisor had a saying if youve never a missed a flight youre spending too much time in airports it applies more generally as well probably like poking holes in a – in a tank for some lizards pet lizards that we bought and checking that indeed if its ten holes this way and seven holes this way then it invariably is going to be 70 holes in total the biggest thing that most people dont realize so much is the travel right the fact that you really get to see the world just going to different conferences having good ideas well i think they illuminate what can and cant be done in computation according to the laws of physics which if you care about that sort of thing and a lot of people seem to then hopefully its of interest to you well at the sort of level of the historic greats i would say alan turing at the level of people who i personally got to know i would say umesh vazirani my advisor at berkeley he had this saying to concentrate on the high order bits right just concentrate on the important stuff dont worry about the trivial stuff and he really sort of showed that by example what would surprise people is just how little in theoretical computer science we actually rely on computers we use them to check email and do word processing pretty much like anyone else myself probably aside from yourself oh aside from myself i guess my computer is probably the most expensive thing there no i dont play music nah if its – if its ambience then ill enjoy listening to it but im happy to just hear the sounds of the street
