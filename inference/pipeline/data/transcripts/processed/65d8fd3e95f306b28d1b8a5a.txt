quantum computing has demonstrated a lot of exciting potential to accelerate machine learning and data science applications in the future there are already a number of known speed ups of classical algorithms the the exciting area that i see though is not only the speed up but of looking at problems in an entirely different way quantum computing is probabilistic by nature which maps very well to machine learning problems because were not making a model that is the exact best fit for the data we want to do one that is a probabilistic fit for future data one that generalizes well to future data and so quantum computing allows us to get multiple probabilistic solutions that we can then examine and look at the one that has the best utility to actually deploy as a model so that the speedup potential is immense im excited about what i can do and and a number of other applications but also again developing algorithms and methods that are quantum specific rather than just improving known classical methods
