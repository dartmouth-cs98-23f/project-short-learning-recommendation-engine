video analytics 101 today were talking about all these passwords and how they connect artificial intelligence deep learning machine learning computer vision so lets dive right in music all right so lets unpack all these different buzzwords and lets start off with artificial intelligence everybodys talking about it but actually its quite old it started in the 1960s and really defines agents that get input from their environment and act upon it and depending on where we are in this development it means different things back then in the 60s it meant building a simple chatbot that reacts to text input and gets gets you an answer and you might even think that its a human nowadays we mean all kinds of stuff of our devices measuring us and reacting to it and do stuff for us and in the future we might really mean artificial general intelligence so really computers that are like humans and really think intelligently but we are very very far away from this today we really mean automation so measuring the environment and measuring whats happening and then automating stuff based on it so thats artificial intelligence the thing that we all talk about all the time ai now lets talk about something that we dont talk so much about thats computer vision but computer vision is all around us computer vision is the field that deals with the problem of making machines see so you get an input of a video a an image and so on and you try to find ways how the machine could interpret this and really see what is happening out there good example is quality inspection in manufacturing so if you are producing bottles for example you might use computer vision to verify that the quality is okay and detect any faults so this is a very typical example its not necessarily artificial intelligence but its also computer vision but what is computer vision and artificial intelligence is for example making robot c thats where these two overlap but they dont overlap 100 its really part of the things overlap and now the third field is machine learning machine learning also is around for a very long time but recently has been more prominent and thats the idea of training systems automatically and letting them learn things to detect things and react to things and this is an approach that that is being used more and more where we dont have to define everything explicitly but its really learning so we use data to train it and finally the thing that is used a lot nowadays is called deep learning and deep learning is a subfield of machine learning where we introduce the idea of using vast amount of data to basically completely automate the training process we dont even have to tell it what it should learn it really learns automatically and deep learning and machine learning are used everywhere and part of it is being used in our artificial intelligence but there are other applications where its not artificial intelligence so again those are fields that are overlapping but are not overlapping 100 same thing with computer vision so of course we use machine learning and deep learning why do we want to detect a person or a vehicle so thats where we use deep learning with computer vision or for computer vision or as technology of computer vision but if we use machine learning for natural language processing of course thats not part of computer vision but it is part of artificial intelligence so thats where you see all of these things really overlap in venn diagrams its not a subset of each other its really overlapping fields and in video analytics we are exactly in the middle and in this intersection of all of this so video analytics nowadays when we talk about it its exactly the intersection where deep learning intersects with computer vision and it intersects with artificial intelligence this is the field that were talking about its not a subset of all of this its read all these intersections of these three to four fields how to interact together i hope this explanation gave you a good overview of what artificial intelligence is what computer vision is what machine learning is and what deep learning is so we can all talk about the same things in the same language if you enjoyed this please dont forget to subscribe and otherwise see you next time music
