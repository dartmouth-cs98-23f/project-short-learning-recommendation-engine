okay so im zahra ashktorab from ibm research and im really excited to present to you the work we did on quantum humancomputer interaction i did this work with my colleagues justin weisz and maryam ashoori from ibm research so quantum computing was once considered a purely theoretical domain but its rapidly becoming a reality with the availability of publicly accessible quantum computing systems and has recently gained a lot of attention for the things that it can potentially accomplish it has the potential to accomplish problems considered intractable for classical computers for example scientists have used computers to determine the ground state energy for beryllium hydride a complex inorganic molecule performing these kinds of simulations has a tremendous computational cost often intractable for classical computers but the results of these simulations may lead to discovery of new drugs and materials and even bolster clean energy efforts so one might ask how did hci researchers get involved with quantum hci and are interested in defining a new practice of quantum hci stem from our experiences in joining a new team that was focused on building tools for quantum scientists as hci researchers new to quantum computing we found ourselves spending a lot of time familiarizing ourselves and learning new concepts and terminology that were quite outside of our comfort zone and during this process we realized the tremendous impact that good hci research and practice could have on the field so in this talk im gonna begin with a short primer on quantum computing so in classical computing information is encoded with bits that are either in the state of zero or one in quantum computing information is encoded in qubits and as with classical computing they can be in a state of zero or one but they may also exist in the state of superposition in which their true state is unknown until it is measured and they may also be entangled with each other such that measuring the state of one qubit tells us about the state of the other without measuring it and so these are just some very basic features that make quantum computing so powerful next im gonna talk about existing quantum computing tools so theres a number of tools available for programming quantum systems both in simulation and with actual hardware guis such as ibms composer and quirk enable people to program their own quantum circuits and visualize the results theres also programming languages and sdks such as ibms qiskit and microsofts liqui and they allow people to develop quantum algorithms and run them in simulation sometimes on actual hardware next im gonna talk about the methods that we used so we recruited a small batch of participants from our own organization through an email seeking individuals who conduct research and quantum computing we then did snowball sampling by asking who they would recommend to speak with both internal and external to our organization we had a total of seven participants from industry government and academia our interviews were semistructured and probed the following areas education and background application and algorithms programming tools and workflow and community so the next couple of slides im gonna talk about the areas of inquiry which we identify through these interviews the first of which was understanding quantum users developing and evaluating educational materials designing programming and debugging tools and finally visualizing quantum designing effective technologies for effective programming quantum systems requires an understanding of the different types of people who will use those systems and our quantum development team had conducted early stage user research that identified three quantum users quantum scientists science enthusiasts and developers our first group quantum scientists include professors postdocs and graduate students in physics and quantum information science they perform experiments using quantum simulators on real quantum computers science enthusiasts are people who have an interest in quantum computing but no formal background or training in it they may be university students academics and industry professionals all with varying levels of expertise and programming and their primary needs are for educational materials our third group are developers and though this group may have an extensive knowledge on classical computing their knowledge of quantum computing is limited for this audience sdks that provide a higher level functionality and hide the lower level technical details of their quantum implementation are desired so we believe that we captured only a preliminary snapshot of quantum computing users and additional research is needed to more comprehensively identify the people who are currently using quantum computers one of our participants said i think theres another layer of user that we will eventually connect with which is i want to use a quantum computer to accelerate a certain aspect of a certain problem but i wanted as a piece of a much bigger solution the technical folks and banks and finance and chemical design already have environments they are using to work inside and i think i will eventually take quantum and plug it in quantum computing is a highly technical subject and that said there are several notable efforts that have aimed to make quantum computing more accessible interesting and fun there are introductory guides that have low math or no math introductions to quantum computing metaphor based approaches to teach the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics quantum games and online quantum communities so over the last decade thereve been emergence of introductory books that are intended for general audiences additionally institutions like ibm dwave and microsoft provide introductory tutorials for beginners to quantum computing another approach to teach principles of quantum computing is via metaphors so schrodingers cat explains the concept of superposition via thought experiment a cat is kept in a box with a bottle of poison and is simultaneously dead and alive because it is unknown whether the cat drank the poison and for hci researchers here theres an opportunity to evaluate the extent to which these guides and metaphors teach beginners about quantum computing theres also been several noteworthy digital games designed to specifically teach about quantum computing quantum tictactoe mechanic and hello quantum are games that both require players to solve puzzles by trying to teach quantum concepts entanglion is a board game designed to teach fundamental concepts of quantum computing and for hci researchers here theres an opportunity to both design and evaluate the effectiveness of these games for their ability to scaffold learners through the process of understanding core quantum computing concepts to the point of programming quantum systems so from our interviews we found that many of issues with the online communities stem from the fact that the platforms did not distinguish between these novices and experts and our participants experts in their field which is one of the limitations of our study express preferences for specialized communities that encourage deep discussions and information exchange that being said were not advocating for creating a separation or information gate between the novices and experts but a lot of these issues these online communities can be vastly improved by applying the lessons learned by hci and cscw researchers in building successful online communities im gonna go ahead and read one of the quotes from an applied mathematician when you go in the community you sometimes read questions from people who clearly have no idea what quantum computing is because they have high expectations of what it can do and that is not the case we also ask participants about the tools and programming languages they use and discuss the potential of hci research in the following areas paper gui and code documentation and sharing debugging quantum algorithms and quantum native programming despite the numerous tools available for programming quantum systems low fidelity tools have a strong foothold in the daytoday workflow of quantum scientists but visual tools like ibms composer and quirk are also really helpful in applying what has been drawn on these low fidelity tools and they use circuitlike metaphor in which each qubit is represented by a horizontal line one quantum chemist said theres a big difference between writing a circuit on a piece of paper and actually trying to implement it on a machine its like trying to learn computing just reading the theory of computing but never learning a programming language or getting anything to work or debug anything as more people delve into quantum computing such as science enthusiasts and developers a need arises for environments that better integrate documentation and sharing tools and welldocumented workflows are integral to the learning process as with any development workflow debugging is a part of the quantum computing process one participant described how she debunked her code by switching amongst different tools when im tryna figure out an algorithm or debug something i will start with the composer and if i wanna make any changes i go over to qasm which is quantum assembly language to change things there and i go back and forth between the two another described how he used the quantum simulator to perform debugging as a simulator and able to want to view the internal state of all the qubits to debug we used a c simulator for everything out of the simulator you can get the internal state of all the qubits a deeper understanding of how quantum programmers could conduct the debugging process would provide opportunities for developing new kinds of quantum debugging tools and this work should build on previous research that demonstrates the best practices for scientific computing so the development of programming languages for quantum computers largely mirrors that of classical computers but on a much more rapid time scale early quantum system programming evolved from placing quantum gates directly on a circuit to writing assembly style code using the open quantum language assembly language but theres also newer sdks such as qiskit that rely on python to provide a highlevel abstraction which are then translated down to the level of qasm before executing on real quantum hardware simulation a one opportunity for hci researchers is to consider whether these abstractions use to programming classical computers should be applied for programming quantum systems visualization of qubit states are difficult to create because the number of achievable quantum states is exponential with respect to the number of qubits and so hci researchers here can utilize information visualization methods to build more effective visualizations for quantum computing user studies exploring the interpretability of largescale graphs and other largescale visualizations can contribute to improve visualizations of quantum states so im going to also talk about moving forward and what next what the future might look like so while we favorably suggest potential directions for the expansion of quantum computing we acknowledge that our optimism must be tempered with realities of the field so a lot of these scientists did talk about skepticism one of the quantum chemist said the same thing happened with nano and ai at one point they get hyped because they make a few advances and then they dont deliver on their promises and then they get trashed so then no one gives them attention while they are being ignored they slowly or maybe even incrementally improve so suddenly they have some major advances one of our other participants said we dont want the same thing happening with quantum as with ai over hyping it and then realizing that you cant accomplish what you want to accomplish and then abandoning it but these insurgencies around quantum computing and potential for disillusionment should not be reasons to avoid approaching the field instead we see them as opportunities to show the strength that great hci research can bring thank you applause  woman thank you so if anybody has questions we have this microphone here we also have a loose microphone and the student volunteer whos gonna run around so you can just raise your hand any questions yeah  eliana hey im eliana husky douglas from alta university so ive actually heard quantum physics not in this sense but more in the sort of adjunct on realism sts sort of societal thing do you see that more merging with this area of work  thats not something that we really asked about we were focused on these front end tools for quantum computing but i think its such an expansive field and its continuously growing so i can imagine that there are front ending tools for those for those applications as well  woman any other questions from the audience last chance all right lets thank zahra again
