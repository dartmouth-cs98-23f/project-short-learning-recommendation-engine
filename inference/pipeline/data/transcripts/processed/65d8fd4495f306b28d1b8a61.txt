were gonna look at how predictive modeling can be used in an educational setting and more specifically were gonna look at an example of how we can use predictive modeling to detect students who game the system so this video is gonna just start with a brief introduction of predictive modeling and the example of gaming the system so predictive modeling what is it its a category of machine learning which is a field in computer science uh where we study how the computers can learn from data so more specifically uh predictive modeling is a type of supervised learning which means that we know what we want the computer to learn and what we do is we give it example of what we want to learn and we let the computer discover general rules about when the example is or is not an exuh what wean example of what we want it to learn so what predictive modelingwhat were gonna do is were gonna try to develop models that can infer one specific aspect of the data which we call the predicted variables and this prediction can be about future event or they can be about events that are happening at the moment but that are unknown values in our data and so just to give a little bit of vocabulary when we talk about predictive modeling uh wthe predicted variable we also sometimes call it the label and the predictors that are gonna be used to predict that variable we also sometimes call features so im gonna be using those terms in this video so there are two main categories of predictive modeling that were gonna be talking about today the first one is regression and the second one classifications the idea behind those two types of analysis is very similar their main difference is gonna be in the nature of the variable were trying to predict so for regressions were gonna look at predicting variables that are numerical and continuous whereas for classification were gonna look at predicting variables that are categorical so for example for regression uh something that we might be interested in in the educational context is to try to predict how long is it gonna take for a student to solve a problem or what is gonna be the score of the student on the future test or how many weeks is a student gonna stay engaged in an online course um on the hand when were doing classification analysis uh were gonna try to predict a categorical labels so for example will the student complete the course so were not trying to predict what the grade of the student is gonna be were just trying to predict is the student gonna complete yes or no uh the same thing if we look at will the student get the next answer right to this problem so in this video were gonna illustrate the process of building a predictive model using an example of when student games the system which is a classification problem so what exactly is a student gaming the system well its a type of disengaged behavior in which the student try to solve problems without actually having to learn anything by abusing the support that the software gives you so for example trying to abuse the hints provided by the system or trying to systematically try to guess the answer and more specifically were gonna look at the problem of students who game intelligent tutoring system and what intelligent tutoring system is its aa problem solving environments where the problem is broken down into smaller steps and in order to solve the problem the student has to solve each of those individual steps and usually that kind of environment intelligent tutors they will provide support to the student in the form of next step hints about what the student should be doing next and also um feedback on each step to say if the step was correct or incorrect and the reason why were interested in studying gaming the system in those environment is that its been linked to poor learning outcomes and poorer longterm academics success so as i said earlier gaming the system is a classification problem in this problem what were gonna be predicting is a categorical label which is is the student gaming the system or is the student not gaming the system so if we want to build this model the first thing we need to do is we need to get example of what gaming behavior look like so it means we need to collect labels and so there are many different ways to collect labels depending on what type of lavellabel you are looking for some of them might come from the learning environment itself so if youre looking at uh in software performance thedid the student just manage to complete to problem or not uh it could be school records if you want to look at grades of the students uh it could be test data uh but it cannotbut sometimes we also wanna predict things that are not in the learning environment and then in that cases then we will have to go and collect additional data and this can be achieved using survey field observations a video audio text coding theres many different ways to do it in the context of gaming the system well we dont know when students are gaming the system the learning environment does not provide us with information about that the learning environment does not know whether the student is gaming the system or not uh and if it did then we would not need to create a model of it uh so we need additional data collection and one way to do that is to collect data using something we call text replays so text replays what they are is a vistextual representation of the actions that the students are doing in the learning environment so for example here we have a text replay which is a clip of five action that the students was doing in the tutor and so in order to get examples of gaming behavior a human will sit at the computer look at the text replay and then make a judgement on whether uh this is an example of gaming or its an example of not gaming and so if we look at the specific clip just to give you an idea what we can see is that the first action that the student is doing uh they get the correct answer and then they move on to the next step that theyre supposed to do 20 seconds later they answer minutes as the answer for that step and the system tells them that this an error so four seconds later they enter hour which is again an error and then seven seconds later they answer years again an error and 14 seconds later week which is again an error and so what we can see if we look at this behavior is a very systematic behavior of trying to guess what the answer would be by entering all the units of time the student thcan think of in order from the smallest one to the largest one and so a human might look at this behavior and say i think that the student is currently trying to game the system because theyre trying to guess the answer so the human will do that for a large amount of clips ofof behavior from the student to get the large amount of example of gaming and not gaming look like and then once we have those labels what we can do is we can take them and synchronize them with the data of what the student is doing and then we can use that to compute what we call features which is the variables that are gonna be used to create our predictive model and those features are gonna summarize the behavior of the student in that example so this is a process that we call feature engineering so in the context of an intelligent tutor well some of the feature engineering that we might do is look at in that clip of action how many actions were in that specific time window what was the average time taken between each actions uh how many times does the student ask for help how many answers were correct how many answers were incorrect then once weve created those features weve computed them for the different examples of gaming behavior we have then we can synchronize everything together and we get this information about what the student was doing while they were gaming or not gaming so for example here if we take the first row of the table then we can see that for the first row the student did six action and then took three seconds per action which is fairly quick and then they ask five hints theyve got one correct answer and they didnt get any incorrect answer and the human label this particular behavior as gaming the system now once weve collected all this data what we do is we use machine learning algorithms uh to try to identify patterns in the data that might not be easy for human to pick up on and so for example what we might want to do is build something we call a decision tree so that tree what its gonna do its gonna partition the data according to the differenet values of the features and then depending on the different values of the feature its gonna make a prediction baseduh saying whether the student is gaming or not gaming so if we get an example here of what a decision tree might look like uh we start at the root of the tree which is the node at the top so for each node theres gonna be two branches and its gonna separate one of the features into two partition so first of all here we might have uh the first node is looking at the average time that the student takes for action so in this example we might say well if the student is taking more than three seconds per action then the student is not gaming because hes not going fast enough uh and thenbut then if the student is taking three or less seconds per action then were gonna look at the number of hints that were requested if theres a large number of hints that were requested were gonna say the student is gaming the system because theyre asking a lot of hints and going fast now if the student is not asking a lot of hints then maybe we wanna look at the number of incorrect answer and say that if the student is going fast and entering a lot of incorrect answer they might be gaming the system so this model is not an actual true model of gaming the system its just an example to kind of illustrate the process a real model of gaming the system would probably be much more complex now once we have that model what we can do is we can take data about the behavior of the student and use it to get a prediction from the model so for example if the student has an average time for action of eight seconds ask for hints five times and has three incorrect answers then well go into the tree and well take the right branch depending on the value of the feature and what were gonna see here is that because the average time for action is greater than three seconds then the model is gonna say that is not an uh gaming behavior and then we could do the same thing for a different example where the student took three seconds per action on average asked hints six times and entered zero incorrect answer and now we would take the right branch at first because the time is smaller than or equal to three and then we would take the right branch again because the number of hints is greater than four in thatin that case the model would predict that the student is currently gaming the system so this is kind of the process to build the model now once we have the model what well wanna do is evaluate is this a good model uh so i wont go into details on how to evaluate if its a good model or not but just to give you a general idea what were gonna do is were gonna take the model and were gonna reapply it to data for which we have labels and then were gonna compare the labels and the prediction from the model uh ideally thats gonna be done on data thats new and unseen when we were building the model so what you might want to do is take your initial data and then get a part of the data and use it to build your model and then take part of the data and keep it aside for later to test on it uh you can also use more advanced techniques such as cross validation which im not gonna describe in this video so now if we go back to our data we can add a column in our table to say what did the model predict so in this specific example if i use the model that i shown earlier what we would get is that out of five examples the model would get the right prediction four times which means that the model would have an accuracy of 80 so there is many different ways to evaluate the performance of a model many different metrics you can use um each one are gonna have their own strengths so its up to you to decide which one is more appropriate for your data or you can also compute more than one metric so some of them include accuracy precision recall cohens kappa uh and the area under the roc curve also known as auc and now just to quickly conclude this video uh what we did here is we took a very quick overview of how predictive modeling can be used in education uh we can see that it has many different applications uh for example when were studying behavior such as gaming the system uh then we might use our model to study the relationship between the behavior itself and learning outcomes so maybe student who engage in more logaming the system uh dont perform as well on future tests or we can use the model to inform teacher about whats going on with the student so that the teacher can look at the report and see oh theres a lot of gaming going on with this student and i better go and figure out whats going on how i can better support the systhe student or we could use the model to drive automated interventions in the system itself to offset negative learning outcomes so maybe if we observe that the student is gaming the system pretty often then we maybe we can propose remedial learning activities to try to improve the learning for that student
