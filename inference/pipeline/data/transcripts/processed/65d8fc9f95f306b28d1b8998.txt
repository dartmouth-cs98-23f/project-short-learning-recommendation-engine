on playerai interaction what neural network   games reveal about ai as play my name is jennifer  villareale a phd student at drexel university literature on humanai interaction is among one  of the fastestgrowing fields in the kai community   with few exceptions most recent literature  focuses on productivityrelated domains however one overlooked  area is the context of play   the history of ai has long been associated  with games video games have often been the   testbed to try new ai algorithms and use  the user interaction they afford therefore   games offer a rich domain to understand and  explore new ideas in human ai interaction in this work we study the interaction  in neural network based game   we propose the new research area of player ai  interaction in our paper we showcase how the   concept of play can expand the current  discussions around human ai interaction   and point out new opportunities  for ai infused products in general we chose to use neural network games  because they provide insights into   some of the most pressing open  problems in human ai interaction   such as the low interpretability  of the machine learning models these are the methods we used through the  first systematic review in this domain we   collected a data set of 38 games wherein players  can interact with the neural network as part of   the core gameplay loop then using this data set  we used grounded theory to develop a framework   for how players interact with the neural networks  and how much its existence is foregrounded in the   user interface tto compare player ai interaction  to the broader discussion and other ai products   we also adapted existing guidelines for human ai  interaction and used them to evaluate our games our analysis found four interaction metaphors  that provide familiar structures for players to   interact with the ai apprentice competitor  designer and teammate for example the game   aivolution uses nn as teammate metaphor where the  player interacts with the nn as a colleague the   focus of the gameplay is a collaborative cycle  between the player and the nn where they work   together toward a shared goal players are able to  build hilarious looking neural network creatures   and theyre able to construct their brain and  avatar structure in order to train them to compete   in a race this is a new kind of interaction  we typically dont see outside of games yet   playful interaction that motivates players  to try different kinds of ai configurations we also found that there is a  range of how much games highlight   the use of neural networks  in their user interface this visualization represents the  design space of player ai interaction   based on these three dimensions each dot on  this outer ring represents one of the 38 games   this diagram helps us  identify under explore areas   for example we noticed that all games  that adopted neural network as apprentice   interaction used online learning for player agency  such that the player may play with or control the   training of the neural network this interaction  leads to a variety of neural network behaviors   whereas most other metaphors use offline  learning for more predictable player experience we compare the compliance with these guidelines  across the characteristics of our framework most   notably we found that neural network as apprentice  games comply well with the guidelines particularly   with regards to providing global controls to the  user and learning actively from the user behavior   for games where neural network is represented  as a competitor the compliance with the design   guidelines are very low because the guidelines  are not created for the cases where ai is an   adversary however an increasing number of ai  infused products would fall into this category we also compared the design guideline compliance  of neural network games with reported outcomes of   ai infused products by amershi et al to see  what key similarities and differences exist   we find that like other ai infused products  neural network games struggle to make the   limitations of the ai known to the user  during the initial interaction however   games do this intentionally as the point  is to learn the limitations through play   neural network games generally perform better  in enabling the user to provide feedback   indicating their preferences during regular  interaction they are also better in allowing   the user to globally customize what the  ai system monitors and how it behaves for game designers ux designers and hci  researchers interested in human ai interaction   one of our key takeaways is that reframing  ai is play offers a useful design approach   ais play can offer a new design space where users  can tinker explore and experiment with ai   with that we would like to thank  nsf and dff for supporting this work   and the anonymous reviewers for providing their  comments thank you for
