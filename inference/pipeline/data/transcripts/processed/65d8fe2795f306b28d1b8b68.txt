simplified today i want to talk to you about software architecture diagrams and some tools you can use to make your life a little easier when you need to create them so if youre a developer an engineer or a solution architect its absolutely critical that you use architecture diagrams to convey how a system works so theres a lot of options out there ranging from microsoft visio omnigraffle lucidchart and im sure many many others that i probably havent heard of so ive tried a handful of these in the past but what i was really looking for was something that was free easy to use could sync across devices supported collaboration and natively had access to aws icon packs and if you know anything about me im constantly using aws technologies putting together aws architecture diagrams so i dont want to go and hunt down icon packs to use them with whatever software im using so as of now ive only found one that i was happy with that satisfied these criteria and that is what im currently showing you now and its called draw io so drop at io is pretty straightforward to use it supports all your basic shapes arrows layers connections text boxes and on and on and on so my absolute favorite part of this tool is that its available in any browser and does not require a local installation so that means you can access it from literally anything that can run chrome firefox or any other internet browser some of the nice features that are particularly important to me is the fact that by default that gives you access to aws service icons right out of the box so no more hunting down icon packs and installing them on your local machine theyll all be there for you automatically another nice thing about it is that it allows you to select from a vast amount of templates including flow diagrams uml diagrams gantt charts venn diagrams and many many more so as we can see here on the website as im scrolling down they provide you with a ton of examples and depending on your artistic or design abilities your results may come out looking better or worse than what they have on display here so here i am putting together an architecture diagram for a pet project using the draw die tool so clearly i dont have the artistic touch so my diagram looks a little basic but with some extra effort you can make it look just as appealing as some of the examples on the draw de io website so im making use of the aws icon packs here and that comes by default as ive mentioned previously so if youre looking for an architecture or flow diagram software thats free easy to use and supports collaboration trotta io is definitely something that you should check out so i hope you enjoyed todays video and if you did make sure to give it a thumbs up and hit that subscribe button below so you dont miss out on next weeks thanks so much folks and ill see you next time
