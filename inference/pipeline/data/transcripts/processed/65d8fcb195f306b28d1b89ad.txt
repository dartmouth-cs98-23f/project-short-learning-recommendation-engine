this video well be discussing the differences between machine learning and natural language processing the phrase artificial intelligence is frequently associated with complex concepts like machine learning natural language processing and deep learning which are interrelated a popular topic of discussion is the distinctions between natural language processing and machine learning this video aims to clarify the relationship between these two vital subfields of artificial intelligence machine learning and nlp this video is going to be very interesting but before the video starts i recommend you to subscribe our channel and join us on this journey of discovery and innovation so lets delve into the details and explore the distinction between machine learning and natural language processing machine learning and natural language processing are both components of artificial intelligence but they differ significantly as you familiar with term ai which is a technology that makes machines smart like humans thus machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that utilizes statistical methods to tackle large data sets without any human involvement this technique enables the resolution of problems in a manner similar to how humans approach them but using automated processes and massive amounts of data machine learning algorithms are highly effective in areas like natural language processing computer vision and robotics it is a valuable approach for addressing realworld ai challenges as it involves algorithms that teach machines to learn and improve based on data without requiring explicit programming on the other hand natural language processing nlp is a subfield of artificial intelligence that deals with processing raw written text in natural human languages and transforming it into a computerreadable format nlp is capable of performing intelligent analysis on vast amounts of plain text and producing valuable insights from it this technological advancement has revolutionized communication between humans and machines leading to the creation of innovative applications such as sentiment analyzers text classifiers chat bots and virtual assistants virtual assistants like siri and alexa are some of the most wellknown examples of nlp technology that we use daily is nlp considered machine learning the figure below shows that natural language processing and machine learning have some similarities machine learning is frequently used to support natural language processing additionally nlp uses various preprocessing techniques such as 1 tokenization a method to identify key components of sentences or words 2 pos tagging a machine learning technique that identifies and tags parts of speech nouns verbs etc for entity extraction three entity extraction a machine learning technique that extracts entities from text data 4 limitization and stemming techniques that simplify words to their basic form for easier analysis 5 stop word removal a technique that removes commonly occurring words that do not add meaning to the analysis such as me them and have natural language processing requires an understanding of how humans use language including sarcasm humor and bias in different types of text data machine learning algorithms can be used to automate the discovery of patterns in text data but first unstructured text data must be converted into a structured format such as a table machine learning techniques for nlp involve using statistical methods to identify parts of speech sentiments entities etc these techniques can be used in supervised learning models where the model is trained on existing data and applied to new data sets or in unsupervised learning where algorithms are used to extract patterns and make decisions from large data sets so can you learn nlp without machine learning machine learning is essential for natural language processing just as math is essential for physics in physics we use math to represent problems as equations and solve them using calculus similarly we use machine learning techniques to formulate and solve nlp problems techniques like pos tagging bag of words bow tfidf and word to vector are used to structure text data and machine learning is a necessary prerequisite for these techniques to be effective however there is another term to consider deep learning so the question arises is nlp a part of deep learning the diagram below illustrates the interconnectedness of artificial intelligence machine learning natural language processing and deep learning deep learning a subset of machine learning uses artificial neural networks and large data sets to replicate the functioning of the human brain and recognize patterns for decision making nlp on the other hand aims to enable communication between humans and machines by facilitating realtime access to human languages both nlp and deep learning are parts of artificial intelligence with deep learning enhancing nlp applications through vector mapping and increased accuracy without significant human intervention the abundance of data also makes deep learning suitable for unsupervised learning in nlp in conclusion machine learning and natural language processing are both integral parts of artificial intelligence but they differ significantly machine learning involves the use of statistical methods to analyze large data sets without human involvement while natural language processing deals with transforming raw written text in human languages into a machinereadable format machine learning is crucial for nlp as it provides the necessary techniques to structure and analyze text data deep learning a subset of machine learning also plays a significant role in nlp enhancing its applications through increased accuracy and vector mapping so here the video ends if you enjoyed this video then please like this video and leave a comment in the comments section thanks for watching
