welcome to office hours frame whooshes coffee beans rattle frame whooshes alex slurps have you heard the buzz about people using ai to create 3d models weve been seeing a ton of questions lately about how people can and are using artificial intelligence and 3d modeling together melodic music so if you want to know more or youre looking to try it out for yourself today were gonna dive in to two of the most popular free options out there and show you whats possible whats practical and what the future may hold keep watching pencil scribbles harmonious music frame whooshes youve probably seen some of the stunning mindboggling images that people are creating with ai these days and then theres the amazing renderings people can produce from traditional 3d modeling software but did you know that people are actually combining the two together using ai to help create edit and animate 3d models alex mimics explosion lets talk about how you can try this out for yourself for free even if you have little or no experience using ai or 3d modeling software starting with getting set up with the right tools for the purposes of this video well be talking about two of the most popular free options out there for both ai and 3d modeling chatgpt and blender but dont let the price tag fool you both of these are insanely robust and powerful tools lets talk about how to get up and running in blender first blender is an open source software for everyone from creative professionals to hobbyists with amazing tools for 3d modeling sculpting creating photorealistic and highly stylized images and animations plus a whole lot more to get it just open up your web browser and visit wwwblenderorg click download blender and follow the steps to download the correct version depending on your operating system in your downloads folder if youre on a mac double click the dmg file to mount the disk image and then drag the blender app icon into the applications folder to install if youre on a windows machine double click on the installer file then follow the steps to install it if youre on linux ive added a link to blenders reference docs in the video description in case you run into any unexpected issues all right navigate to the folder where you installed the application and launch blender youll see a welcome screen it may be a little different than what you see here depending on the version of blender you download as blender releases frequent updates but the core functions were covering will work just the same you can click once away from the welcome banner and youre ready to go all right next lets talk about chatgpt what is chatgpt chatgpt is an advanced aipowered chat bot developed by a company called open ai chatgpt is trained on vast data sets to mimic human conversation but where it gets really cool is that you can actually ask chatgpt to write and compose unique things based on its machine learning from stories to poetry to essays even computer code and thats how were able to interface with blender to use ai to do our 3d modeling for us to get started head to chatopenaicom sign up if you dont already have an account and once youre logged in youll see a welcome screen with a text field to type a message now real quick i should mention that while its free to sign up and use chatgpt theres also a paid option called chatgpt plus which gets you priority access to the new features and latest version of the machine learning model which at the time of publishing this video is gpt4 a more advanced version of chatgpt than you currently get with a free account which is gpt version 35 frame clicks ill talk more about the differences in improvements between the two later in this video but for now lets go over the basics using the free version since the process youll follow is the same regardless of the version of gpt youre using all right how to use chatgpt and blender together now youre probably already imagining all the exciting possibilities like render me melodic music a three bedroom house on the beach or animate a robot walking melodic music but hold on before we get too far ahead of ourselves lets dial it back and quickly cover the practical fundamentals of how to actually use these two programs together to do that lets ask chatgpt to build us something super basic in blender and then well go from there now as i mentioned earlier chatgpt is able to write computer code or whats called a script which blender can interpret so in our browser window lets ask chatgpt to write a blender script that creates a gold ball youll see chatgpt print out a block of code along with a short explanation of what it created the interesting thing to note here is that chatgpts responses will vary even when asking the exact same question so if youre following along at home your responses will look different than mine also note that i included the word script in my question screen beeps thats because if you just asked chatgpt to create or model something in blender without asking it to write a script specifically it will sometimes respond with stepbystep instructions of how to build it yourself which is also pretty cool but not what we want for the purposes of this video okay lets copy the code block by going to the upper right hand corner and clicking copy then in blender lets delete the default cube so we start with a blank slate to do that select the cube and hit x on your keyboard and click to confirm now in the upper right select the scripting tab click where it says new then in the text area press control  v on a pc or command  v on a mac to paste the script you just copied from chatgpt click the run button and in the upper left corner youll see what the script has created if you click on the layout tab itll get you back to a full view now our ball doesnt look gold but thats just because of blenders default view if we click this icon for material preview across the top now we see the color all right we just created a 3d model in blender using ai of course this is a super simple example and ill admit probably a little underwhelming but theres actually a lot to unpack here first now that you know the basic method you can go back and forth between chatgpt and blender to experiment with creating more and more complex and interesting things but a word of warning oftentimes the things you ask chatgpt to build in blender simply wont work text buzzes and you can waste countless hours emoji groans struggling to get the results youre after why well one of the main reasons is that chatgpts learning model is only trained through 2021 so changes to blender since then may cause chatgpts script to reference something outdated another key factor is just like a human writing code upbeat music the more complex the problem the more code chatgpt has to write keyboard clicks which means there are more chances for it to make a mistake that causes the script to fail now one thing to know is that you can sometimes work with chatgpt to overcome these issues for instance if a script fails try copying the error message and pasting it into your reply to chatgpt it will try and fix the code again just know that for more complicated requests even the fixes often fail but actually the best way you can help chatgpt is to learn some of the fundamentals of blender before you try to use chatgpt and blender together being familiar with the names of the tools and features as well as the fundamentals of how modeling and the basic tools work in blender makes creating effective prompts for chatgpt much easier take our gold ball for example it looks pretty faceted and plain but knowing your tool settings and terminology in blender allows you to prompt chatgpt in a way that can get you closer to the end result youre after if youre completely new to blender i definitely recommend checking out our getting started with blender video before experimenting with your own prompts as it covers many of the basic features and tools youll wanna be familiar with frame whooshes ive added a link in the description okay but what about having chatgpt create me melodic music that three bedroom house on the beach or that walking robot melodic music unfortunately in practical terms its not quite there yet but lets talk about these more complex tasks chatgpt plus and where this is all going because its pretty interesting remember when i mentioned that paid version of chatgpt with a more advanced version of their ai gpt4 well it turns out that this new version does a remarkably better job at creating working scripts for blender when it comes to more complex prompts and while its still not a magic wand that voila bells chime creates super polished outputs lets talk about what it does do effectively and what that means for you first while i was unable to get a working script out of the free version of chatgpt on gpt35 for either a house on the beach or a walking robot using chatgpt plus with version 4 produced a script that did work in blender for both unfortunately this is what it created melodic music for my house on the beach and this is what it created melodic music for a simple robot walking not exactly what i was after but that being said theres some pretty interesting stuff going on here first you can see in the chatgpt response that the logic is there in terms of how it sets out to accomplish this task where it fails is in scripting the execution then again im asking it to do something really complex here similarly but slightly less complex i also ask gpt4 to write a blender 34 script that animates nine planets orbiting around a sun write a blender script that animates the game pong and write a script to create a 3d model of a car in blender while the results are pretty rudimentary theyre also pretty amazing when you think about the fact that all i did was ask an ai to create these things for me in one sentence and potentially really helpful when i think about how much longer it wouldve taken a seasoned blender user to manually create similar examples using blender alone and again these are tasks that simply failed when asking chatgpt35 the same things thats why i think some of the crazy hype around ai and 3d modeling is actually kind of valid while in its current form some of these results may feel a little underwhelming keep in mind that this type of ai is still super new and the idea of using it together with 3d modeling is even newer and not only is the ai itself constantly improving but as more people start to use this type of scripting approach to combine ai and blender the more blender developers will continue to streamline and improve melodic music the way in which the two interface together and who knows maybe its not so far off that chatgpt will be designing you that threebedroom house on the beach tropical music all right so now that you know the basics of how to use chatgpt and blender together whats next try out your own
