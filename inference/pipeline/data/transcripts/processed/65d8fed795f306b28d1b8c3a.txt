rationality as a theory of humancomputer interaction our point of departure is the observation that interactive behavior is highly adaptive that is the way we act and think emerges somehow as a function of our beliefs goals capabilities and the design understanding this emergence is the primary goal of this theory computational rationality builds on advances in machine learning where among others reinforcement learning has shown tremendous success in solving complex interactive tasks in reinforcement learning an agent tries to learn a sequence of actions that maximizes its rewards this is very similar to hci where users goals are often distal and the world subject to uncertainty and partial observability however ai research is not aligned with hcis goal of explaining human adaptation during the recent years there has been increasing interest in exploiting rl to model hci tasks here you see an rl agent from last years chi it moves its eyes and fingers to type a given sentence with a given ui design the model demonstrates very humanlike behavior in how it monitors typing errors and reacts to them the benefit of rl for hci is that we can change the design and a new behavior emerges here autocorrection was turned on and the agent learned to type in faster and a more relaxed way relying on the autocorrection remarkably and in a stark contrast to the nowpopular supervised learning paradigm in rl no human data is required for training agents in the wake of increasing interest in the field of hci we have to ask what is computational rationality for hci that is what are its core theoretical commitments modeling ideas and what is the scope of tasks that we can model with it computational rationality originates from the theory of reinforcement learning but in applications in hci it takes ideas from classical cognitive architecture models like epic and goms in particular it assumes that the agent can only access its internal environment or cognition to model that environment we can take ideas from cognitive architectures among others we then use rl solvers to approximate boundedly optimal policies which generates predictions of human adaption to sum up the theory assumes that humanlike adaptive behavior emerges if the the relevant internal and external bounds are correctly specified lets compare this more closely with the familiar cognitive architectures paradigm first while cognitive architecture models model cognition as an information processor in computational rationality the key purpose of cognition is to pick actions that are beneficial for it while in cognitive architecture models a researcher manually specifies a rule set in computational rationality a policy is obtained via optimization for example via reinforcement learning both approaches share the idea that behavior is limited by cognition however in cognitive architecture models a theory is expressed by a program or a rule set while in computational rationality we use decisiontheoretic formalisms for example socalled pomdp  or partially observable markov decision process the theory makes four key commitments the first is that the user faces a decision problem that is stochastic and sequential in other words it must pick an action that maximizes its future rewards however this is done under partial observability of the world that is stochastic second it does not have access to the hard external reality but only to its own cognitive states third these states are limited by the bounds of human cognition fourth the agents behavior over time approximates a policy optimized within those bounds if you are familiar with rl from the machine learning side the main difference is the internal environment illustrating this further in standard rl the agents policy is constrained by the external environment we use rl to find the policy that maximizes the agents subjective payoff by contrast in computational rationality we are also bounded by the agents internal environment the emergent behaviors can be very different between these two approaches how are such models created we start modeling by creating a simulated environment that contains the user agent in its environment including the design for example the eyes and fingers of a typist operating on a simulated touchscreen interface inputs and outputs to that system are processed by the internal environment for example our motor and perceptual systems which are then made available as states for the agent we further need to specify a reward function for example maximize speed while minimizing errors after this we ask a rl solver to learn a policy after training we can simulate the learned policy and compute different dependent variables that were interested in for example in the typing model we can compute trajectories heatmaps and summary statistics in that particular paper the results were remarkably close to human data in a stark contrast to ai research the goal here is note to learn agents that are superior to humans but to predict their behavior including their imperfections like the errors they make but how far are with this type of modeling the paper reviews every paper published on the topic so far 15 altogether they can be divided into six interactive tasks ranging from typing to driving and decisionmaking the paper also talks about an emerging opportunity to apply these models to explain human behavior thanks to the fact that they have fewer number of free parameters they can be fit to realistic human data much better than cognitive architecture models this is done via socalled likelihood free inference where we try to find a combination of model parameters that produces as much as humanlike data as possible see the paper for examples another emerging opportunity concerns design and adaptive uis here we can use computational rationality to predict how users might adapt to changes caused by a design or an intervention see the paper for examples to summarize hci has a distinct interest toward computational rationality while ai research studies it as a general theory of intelligence and cognitive science as a theory of human intelligence in hci we are interested in its potential to inform the design of better uis however to make the approach more broadly accessible and relevant using ben shneidermans term we need to expand it from microhci and macrohci in order to touch topics like computedmediated communication interactive ai and ubiquitous computing several outstanding theoretical challenges remain such as how to model human motivation learning situations or social interactions thank you for your attention
