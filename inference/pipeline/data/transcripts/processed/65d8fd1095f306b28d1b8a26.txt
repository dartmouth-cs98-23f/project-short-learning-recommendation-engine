this video lets discuss some of the best technologies for the coming year yes you heard it right we will focus on the top 10 technologies to learn for 2023 stick to the end of the video to know which is the most trending technology of 2023 but before we begin consider subscribing to our channel simply learn and hit the bell icon to never miss any updates so if you are a tech geek heres a question for you what was the first digitally operated and programmable robot called here are the options unicorn unimate unifac and yeah let us know your answer in the comment section below so without any further delay lets check the technology which is at number 10 on our list 10 extended reality extended reality or xr covers everything that falls under augmented reality ar virtual reality vr mixed reality mr or anything in between businesses and major industries like entertainment marketing and design benefit massively from extended reality frameworks according to globe newswire the extended reality market is set to grow from 26 billion dollars in 2020 to as high as 397 billion dollars by 2026 boasting a cagr of 5791 with technological giants like google samsung and apple looking for extended reality experts regularly the demand for trained professionals in this domain has grown substantially boasting average salaries of 68 thousand dollars to one hundred two thousand dollars annually lets unlock the next technology training at number nine edge computing more of architecture rather than technology edge computing is a distributed computing pattern that brings data storage and computation closer to the data source thereby improving the response time and saving the bandwidth its considered an important factor for the success of the 5g and iot industries as per reports edge computing is estimated to reach 1013 billion dollars with a cagr of 178 percent thanks to an exponential increase in the job market big names like amazon hp and ibm higher edge computing experts with an average salary estimated at one hundred and seventy thousand dollars per annum the next technology on this list is 5g and wifi 6 we live in a world where massive amounts of data need to be transmitted quickly with the increased adoption of video conferencing meeting reliable connection and higher bandwidth this is for 5g and wifi 6 comes into play 5g networks are slated to have more than 17 billion global customers by 2025 according to the gsm association with the major players being samsung cisco and nokia among others the worldwide market for 5g is also anticipating growth with cagr of 671 percent propelling newer technologies like iot and virtual reality into mass production for the public wifi 6 on the other hand provides improved security and high internet speed even when congested it is expected to grow from 115 billion us dollars in 2022 to 262 billion us dollars by 2027 with cagr of 179 percent up next we have blockchain blockchain is now revolutionizing every sector from banking and healthcare to politics these are a few industries that may profit from establishing a decentralized digital ledger that monitors and saves data in several locations making forgeries difficult companies that use blockchain are hsbc barclays walmart and pfizer to name a few blockchain developers need to know cryptography data structures and computer networking according to reports by 2023 the market evaluation of blockchain is expected to reach 199 billion dollars with a cagr of 428 percent with the rise of nft craters are earning vast amounts of money next on our list is cyber security and digital trust several organizations have fallen prey to cyber attacks including big names like facebook linkedin and yahoo the onset of the covid19 pandemic has triggered a rise in the number of cyber attacks across the globe hence the field of cyber security holds paramount importance in todays times a few of the best cyber security companies are cisco microsoft mcafee and ibm knowledge of operating systems networking and virtualizations are must knows in the cyber security domain recent reports suggest that the global cyber security markets is expected to reach 3182 billion us dollars by the end of 2023 with a cagr of 152 percent the technology trending on number five is robotics and automation robotics is an influential industry gaining momentum over time in the coming years robotics will offer a lot to the world like smart factories the adoption of agile robotics and cobots to name a few some companies actively working in the field of robotics are boston dynamics and universal robots some core robotic skills you need to possess are python matlab problem solving mathematics and machine learning the global robotics market is estimated to reach 7084 million dollars by the end of 2023 with a cagr of 105 percent at number four we have iot internet of things quickly becoming an integral part of our lives iot or the internet of things is a futuristic technology recognized for its social and technological marvels iot devices are increasing by almost 31 yearly and according to reports there will be 30 billion iot devices by 2022 the number of active devices is estimated to double by the end of 2023 iot has aided firms in improving customer service streamlining operations and increasing profits mindtree ibm ge digital and verizon are a few companies getting more involved with iot the top indemand iot skills are machine learning and ai python javascript big data and nodejs according to reports it is estimated that the market value will reach or even exceed 5664 billion by the end of 2027 with a cagr of 67 percent now coming to the top three we have quantum computing quantum computing uses the properties of quantum physics to perform calculations and simulations that would not be possible on a traditional machine while not just a research experiment anymore quantum computing is a tool changing the face of several industries including medicine biology and climate change big names like microsoft google ibm and intel are in the race to build quantum computing tools to learn quantum computing you need to know programming mathematics mechanics scientific computing and algorithms reports state that the quantum computing market is estimated to reach 4114 million by 2026 with a cagr of 242 percent at the runnerup position we have proof of work and proof of stake decentralized cryptocurrency networks must ensure that transactions are carried out safely and securely without a centralized organization like visa or paypal to accomplish this networks use a technology known as a consensus mechanism proof of work and proof of stake are the two consensus mechanisms that enable all the computers in a crypto network to concur on which transactions are valid proof of work is the older one of them used by bitcoin ethereum 10 it uses mining by miners around the world and proof of stake is the newer consensus mechanism that powers ethereum 20 cardano tezos which employs a network of validators to validate the new transaction update the blockchain and earn a reward if to excel in this technology you should have proficiency in at least one high level programming language a solid grasp of cryptography and security principles knowledge of smart contracts and familiarity with algorithms and data structures according to statistics it is estimated that the market value will reach 69 billion by the end of 2030 and the technology that has taken the world by storm ranking at number one is ai as a service gone are the days when you needed a hard copy of a map to travel to your favorite place as google maps has efficiently replaced them with its powerful ai ai or artificial intelligence is the top most trending technology today it enables machines to think and act like humans now talking about ai as a service aiaas is a third party offering ai services which help individuals and organizations to conduct ai experiments at low cost some top companies using ai as their core technology include google amazon apple and microsoft the market value of ai is projected to reach 424 billion us dollars with a cagr of 2975 percent that concludes our list of the top 10 technologies for the year 2023 so if you plan to educate yourself and get trained in any of these technologies
