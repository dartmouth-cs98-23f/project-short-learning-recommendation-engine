would be when you discover something new or you find a new way to create something it  always gets you excited  or you find a new way to create something it  always gets you excited  thats the best part my passion comes from the massive amount of  cartoons and 3d animated movies that i watched  just growing up elements of them were inspiring  and i keep thinking about how i could make them better i picked computer innovation because it has a  real artistic bend to it im able to sort of take the assignments and be myself i think its the  combination of creativity and technical knowledge the types of jobs we can get with these degrees  some people are very technical and theyll become   web developers other people prefer to work on  the front end and then become web designers   also our animation both in 2d and 3d were  just now launching a game design program   thats entirely webbased there are a lot of jobs out there its a great growing industry the worlds becoming a lot more  digital the program is fantastic i was always interested in video games and  animation in general and so i just wanted   to see maybe theres a program that can help me  understand it a bit better and get into that field we have two degrees one is an as and one is an aas  they are very similar we usually recommend for people who are thinking of going on for a fouryear degree to get the   as degree while people who are just want  the twoyear degree they go with the aas we have about five different certificates that  cover some of the classes in digital graphics   you have people coming in from high school and you  have people coming in that work full time that are   my age and its just so great to have  such a variety in class and get to know everybody in their different backgrounds so before i came to school i was a bartender  fulltime i decided i needed something a little bit more stable where i was in control so saint paul college was an avenue towards that they have lots of great scholarship opportunities  for me as an adult learner and then flexible course times the instructors here at saint paul college its very easy to not only get along with them but to also understand the material so if some things may be a little bit too confusing theyre very open to talking to you to make sure that you understand it better   its extremely flexible based on your knowledge you dont have to be experienced in the field at all in order to  do it  so if you have no knowledge coming into this no matter what your age is you can do it you can come here and do it theres no problem for people who are looking for affordability  who are looking for a lot of variety in the field of web design and animation coming to saint paul college its probably the most affordable it could ever get for someone and it works very well for anybody that wants to give it a shot
