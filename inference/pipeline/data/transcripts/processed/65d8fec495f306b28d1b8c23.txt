edward tufte voiceover in the arrangement of visualization every single pixel should testify directly to content as johnny ive the great apple designer said we spend most of our time getting design out of the way its got to get out of the away because its about the relationship with the viewer and how they reason about the content style and aesthetics cannot rescue failed content if the words arent truthful the finest optically letterspaced typography wont turn lies into truths there are enormously beautiful visualizations but its as a byproduct of the truth and the goodness of the information the big steps in showing information began all with cartography about 6000 years ago when the first map was scratched into a piece of stone and that has wound up now with the most widely seen visualization in the world which is google maps where people are using a visualization to actually do something the next big step was development of real science galileo got his telescope going he saw things that have never been seen before he made beautiful drawings of sunspots and hed watched the sun for about 40 days and he did engravings of the sunspots so he visualized what he saw and so the history of visualizing data is very substantially a history of science julie steele voiceover data visualization is not just some airy fairy creative process but its actually a very linear process of decision making that you can do based on some few basic principles three things should inform your design always one is you as the designer what you have to say and what you want to communicate two is the reader that reader is not you and theyre going to come with their own context and their own biases and their own assumptions and you need to account for that and third is the data itself and what that has to say and how that informs the truth theres a lot of subconscious brain activity happening we evolved for it to happen that way we evolved to see things and make snap decisions are all those lines in the graph just dried grass or is that a tiger thats coming to eat you growling we have to be able to recognize those patterns right away and make snap decisions on them in order to survive and that can be an advantage as a designer you can communicate a lot of information very quickly because we all have brains that are designed to recognize patterns this way but also theres the emotional impact we react to design and to art and to the aesthetics of a piece just as much as we react to the information contained in it and so if you want to change someones mind if you want to change someones behavior sometimes presenting the information in a visual format is the fastest way to get them to engage with that information josh smith voiceover truth is one of those ambiguous things that you cant really define and probably changes and evolves the more understanding you have data itself is a result of research so i would say that data is just a clue to the end truth i think a successful infographic tells a story it communicates hopefully accurate and sometimes complicated data in a way that many people can understand i think the first step usually is always dig really deeply into the data ourselves and find each key point and create a hierarchy and a narrative out of that story when you start to merge different pieces of information and when you start to learn really what its all saying the narrative is clear the one key fact that everything can revolve around its the hero of the piece theres one single piece of data or insight that people respond to and kind of encapsulates the whole vision and then invite people in to see the nuances and all of the rest of the story around it when you look at a piece its successful when it translates data from something thats complicated to something simple when it communications a message that otherwise would have taken somebody hours to digest and find in an instant jer thorp voiceover my deepest interest lies in the boundary between data and culture data are measurements of something in very many cases the somethings that were talking about are human systems were dealing with data systems that are larger than anything that humans have ever built or experienced before and these really large systems things happen within them that are emerging for example gate change combined shot footage from airports for pretty much every airport in the world and then air travel data as well so the central idea was to show people that every time that youre in an airport you are standing on the surface of a system that is almost too complex to comprehend any given time there are more than a million people in the air and so theres another purpose of data visualization theres revelation which is show us something that weve never seen before this is for me much more exciting anybody can visualize data in excel and see some bar charts for me its about showing them something in this kind of loose narrative frame that they can interpret so we show them some pieces of the picture and the idea is that they can sort of stand back from that and watch it pass for a little bit and come out of it with some deeper understanding part of it is leaving it open to interpretation but part of it is also not really knowing i dont have some masterful understanding of this system that you dont i have some ideas about how these systems might be changing and how they might be growing and how they may be important toward culture and society and i want to share some of those ideas with you and maybe you can put together something that i wouldnt have been able to put together edward tufte voiceover i think in general audiences are a lot smarter than a lot of people think so its not know your audience its respect your audience and really know your content thats what you should be knowing and reasoning about look after truth and goodness and beauty will look after herself you want to see to learn something not to confirm something we usually see to confirm things its very economizing for the brain how can we see not to confirm but to see to learn music playing
