this is sahn in todays video im going to share with you our   proven strategies for crushing  your system design interviews having interviewed countless candidates i’ve  seen up close what works and what falls short   when it comes to preparing  for these tough interviews stick with me for the next few minutes  and i’ll guide you through a preparation   approach that’ll have you tackling any  system design question with confidence lets dive right in first off you might be wondering  what is a system design interview at a high level its purpose  is to assess your ability to one translate an ambiguous problem statement  into concrete technical requirements two craft an architecture and design  that satisfies those requirements three articulate and defend your design  decisions throughout the discussion you’ll be asked to design large scale systems  like an instagram feed uber ride sharing   twitter timelines or even the  infrastructure behind google search remember there’s no such thing as  the right or “perfect” solution the goal is to demonstrate  your technical expertise   your approach to problem solving and  your skills to communicate effectively now you may be wondering  why should we care  about preparing for system design questions whats the big deal well here’s the main reason your performance in a system design  interview can often determine whether   you land a senior engineer position or if  you’re considered for a more junior role once you’ve clocked in a  few years in the industry   system design is how companies gauge your  ability to build complex systems at scale essentially shine bright in  the system design interview   and you’re on track for those senior titles but if you hit bumps along the way you could  be looking at offers for more junior positions so it pays to put in the work and  take these interviews seriously you might be thinking how on earth can these companies assess our  abilities in such a short period of time and you’d be right  they can’t not fully these interviews are in many ways  proxies for realworld scenarios they are an approximation at best it’s on us to help the interviewers get the  signals they need so they can vouch for us it’s not a perfect system by any means   but companies are always wary of  the repercussions of a wrong hire these simulated challenges are often the  best tool they have at their disposal so how should we prepare for  these demanding interviews here’s a blueprint that’s consistently  worked for acing system design questions first and foremost practice  practice and practice get handson with designing realworld  apps and services we use regularly   like instagram uber and gmail just reading about the underlying  architectures isn’t enough take out a pen and paper and draw we must push ourselves to sketch out the core  components and how they interact with one another for example design the backend  architecture for instagram from scratch think through the key parts like the  frontend clients that users interact with   the application servers processing millions  of requests the caching mechanisms to speed   up response times the dedicated databases for  storing posts comments and feeds and of course   the distributed object storage essential  for hosting billions of photos and videos then sketch out how the main flows work  like how  would an enduser’s image get uploaded and stored how would the algorithms determine  the order of posts in a user’s feed how would the system leverage cached data  and when would it make database calls actively constructing each piece of the puzzle not   only deepens understanding  but reinforces retention next study common design patterns like  load balancing database sharding content   delivery networks caching frequently  accessed data just to name a few know the pros and cons of  different approaches so you   can intelligently weigh tradeoffs in the design if you’re interested we have plenty of videos  on many system design patterns on this channel when studying these patterns anticipate the types   of questions an interviewer may ask  and practice responding confidently for example questions like why did you  choose redis for caching instead of memcached be ready to dive into technical details  like redis’ superior data structures and   its persistence options to justify your choices also get very comfortable using whiteboards  diagramming apps and other visual tools in many interviews youll be required  to visually represent your thoughts whether its a whiteboard during an  inperson interview or a diagramming   application for virtual setups  become proficient with these tools you want the tools themselves to be  second nature so you can focus on   communicating the design effectively  not struggling with the interface and finally do regular mock  interviews to practice endtoend nothing beats realtime practice that mimics  the settings and pressures of the real deal get feedback not just on the technical  design but also on your communication skills   ability to think on your feet and on how  efficiently you manage the allotted time use mock interviews as a mirror reflecting  areas of strength and those needing improvement during the interview start out by asking targeted   questions to deeply understand the  use cases scalability requirements   technical constraints and other key  parameters before starting your design avoid the temptation to dive right into proposing   features – first nail down the  core requirements and scope be hyper aware of managing your time wisely between introductions clarifying questions  diagramming and minor interruptions   your actual design time is far less  than the full interview length every minute counts so pace yourself  appropriately and keep moving forward identify any potential time sinks in advance as you diagram out components   flows and bottlenecks think out loud and  verbally walk through your thought process explain your rationale tradeoffs   and decisions  don’t make the interviewer  guess what’s going on in your head vocalize assumptions as well as you walk through your design  document the key aspects on the   whiteboard so the interviewer  can follow your thought process break the system into logical components highlight the main data flows  and dependencies between them avoid getting bogged down in  lowlevel details  focus on   architecting the highlevel  design and broader tradeoffs if you get stuck take a breath and dont panic ask clarifying questions to resolve uncertainties think through issues incrementally  and systematically to get unblocked overcoming obstacles and making progress with  incomplete information is part of the challenge if you’d like more guidance on  what to do during the interview   we have a video on using our structured  4step approach to system design interviews alright that wraps up our key strategies  for crushing system design interviews i know these kinds of openended architecture  questions can seem intimidating at first   but with focused practice using  the techniques i outlined   youll be consistently nailing  system design in no time there are no shortcuts it’ll take some hard work best of luck with your upcoming  interviews you got this if you want to take your system
