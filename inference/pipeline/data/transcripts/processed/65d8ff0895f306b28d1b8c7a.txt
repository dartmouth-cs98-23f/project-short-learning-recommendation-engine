channel today i want to talk to you about what programming language you should learn if you want to get involved in quantum computing im going to introduce you to some of these quantum computing frameworks and packages that are out there and give you all the resources that you need to get you started on coding on real quantum computers today and yes quantum computers do exist they were actually out there theyre for real thats a question i get asked a lot and you can code and with some of these packages on real quantum chips synthesis do tend to code in a lot of different programming languages so for example ive done work at c c even fortran so i graduated college in 2012 and i actually still used for trams the supercomputer upstairs would only take that but dont worry quantum computing has come to a more modern age so if you want to learn coding and get involved in quantum computing what programming language should you study my recommendation is for you to learn python and i know you hear that a lot but hear me out theres three major reasons why you should learn python if you want to get involved in quantum computing its easy to learn theres a ton of resources out there and a lot of quantum computing frameworks are written for python now i know theres a lot of awesome quantum computing languages out there that are not based on python theres q sharp which is microsofts quantum programming language based on csharp and theyre silk which is this new programming language out of eth zurich which looks really cool but i want to cover those in another video so if youre new to programming and eventually want to get involved with quantum computing these are the reasons that i think you should learn python so number one its simple syntax and easy to learn python is beginner friendly even if youre new to programming and havent touched code before python is almost written like a sentence so you can almost intuitively feel like what its supposed to do and python is basically everywhere for example the mac os comes with it preinstalled so you dont even have to install anything or do any complicated setup to get started with python you can do so many things with python ive used it for web apps web scrapers automate some boring stuff to save me time so its a pretty amazing language in fact according to stack overflow python is now the most popular programming language overtaking java and javascript so definitely a great thing to learn number two lots of resources out there like i mentioned you can use python for scripting web development a and now quantum computing because people use it for so many things there are so many resources out there so you can learn from books youtube videos or interactive coding tutorials and because python is beginner friendly and a lot of people learn it as their first programming language itll introduce you to all these broader coding concepts so dont worry if you dont know anything about for loops or recursion itll usually be covered in these resources so down below in the description ive linked a bunch of my favorite python learning resources my favorite online courses dr chucks python for everybody i really love it because it not only introduces you to python thinking but also introduce you to mathematical and computational thinking if youre more of a book reader here are two books id recommend for learning about python the first one is called learn python the hard way and its been updated for python 3 and its one of the first programming books ive ever picked up the other one that i heard great things about is python crash course for those whod like to do more youtube videos and learning coding from there free code camp has a fourandahalfhour youtube tutorial so just make sure to break it up into little chunks and make a study plan to get through it and finally if you learn better through interactive coding tutorials python orgs learning tutorials are amazing and number three the most important reason why you should learn python is because theres so many python frameworks for quantum computing a few years ago if you wanted to code on a quantum computer it meant that you had to be a researcher in a secret lab or in graduate school to get access to one now thats not true anymore quantum computers exist in their cloud systems lets let you log in and run code on a real quantum computer companies are now making quantum computers this is really opened up the opportunity for anyone who wants to try the running code on a quantum computer to do it a lot of these packages are also open source and welcome contributions from anyone so you can really get started right now with programming for quantum computers while there are more quantum computing frameworks than just these that im gonna talk about some of them are kind of close source or not available to anyone unless youre part of a university or a group so i really wanted to focus on the ones where you dont need any special access so lets talk about cirque circus googles library for writing manipulating and simulating quantum circuits currently you cant run any of these circuits on googles quantum computing chips but they have said thatll make it available soon so cross your fingers another really cool thing about google is that the team at x has released tensorflow quantum this is really awesome because theres a ton of people there working on quantum machine learning tens our little quantum works with quantum data and working with both classical machine learning models and quantum models together to start learning about tensorflow quantum go to their website because theres a ton of code and learning samples and jupiter notebooks that you can play around with to learn more about the system another framework is called kiss kit kiss kit is ibm software development package for working with noisy quantum computers at all different levels they have 4 different modules to use called terra err ignace and aqua used for working with quantum computers from the circuit and the pulse level all the way up to the optimized algorithms level terra has the lowlevel elements so for example the circuits and the pulses air is a simulator and the noise models enos is really used for mitigation of those noise models and aqua is used for higher level quantum algorithms you can run these on ibms real quantum chips in the cloud ibm has also released an open source textbook with basic quantum computing concepts and how to use kiss kit they also have a ton of tutorials and jupiter notebooks that are already set up with example code and concepts so you can run code very quickly motion is d waves tool you can use ocean to connect 2d ways leap platform and run code on their simulators or d waves actual machines do you wave is a quantum annealer so its a little bit different from the other two this type of machine is great for optimization problems where you need to quickly search over the space and find a minimum or a solution to a problem the webinar series has a superfun tutorial in choosing a pokemon team using q bo which is quantum unconstrained binary optimization which is a common algorithm and machine learning so you can use a quantum computer to choose the best pokemon team beyond that theres just so many packages and tool boxes out there for python to make working with quantum computers way easier for example a qtip or project you also a company called xanadu has released penny lane which is a python library for quantum machine learning that connects to a bunch of different cloud platforms and helps you run quantum code on real computers so python is a great programming language to learn if youre interested in working with quantum computers one day its also a generally good programming language to have in your skill set a bunch of companies are hiring python programmers and its one of the fastest growing languages out there so whether youre just starting out in computer science youre an experienced programmer theres a chance for anyone at any level to become involved with quantum computing today so ive included a bunch of resources below all the ones ive talked about the different webinars and tutorials that ive talked about in this video click the description theyll all be in there so i hope you enjoyed this video and i hope you found some interesting new resources and are considering getting into quantum computing programming so if you did id appreciate it if you smash the like button below and subscribe if you want more videos on this and feel free to comment down below if you have any questions on quantum computing or software id be happy to answer
