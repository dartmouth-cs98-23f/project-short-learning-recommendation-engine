that is the user interface design so here its the name itself is saying that a user interface design user means we are the people we are communicating with the software we are interfacing some user interface design is helpful to the users to access the web pages so the user interface is first it is a frontend the user interface is so i am writing ui as a user interface user interface is a front end application we call it as a frontend application because we are accessing that page so that is present in front of us so thats why we call it as a friend and application it is a frontend application view to which user interacts in order to use the software so the user wants to use the software so with the help of this user interface applications so the user user interface applications of frontend application view to which the user interacts in order to use the software so here in the user interface regional design user can manipulate manipulate and control software and hardware so the user can have the chap permissions to manipulate and control the software as well as the hardware by means of by means of user interface so with the help of the user interface only this user that user can manipulate and control hardware as well as the software with the help of this user interface so let us take one example so in this example suppose today whatever user interface we are founding is is one at most every place like were in vista technologies that exists so like right from computers in the computers we are having the user interface so which you are seeing else so the windows desktop whatever you open that is an user interface okay so its a if you want to manipulate and control any software and the hardware in your system you need some user interface these are device so with the help of this user interface you are going to manipulate and control all the softwares that are present in your system as well as the hard bits so just like a computer a computer is one of the user interface design means it i user interfaces found in computers in the same way in the mobile phones in the mobile phones you are having the user interface means whatever you are seeing on that small phone that is a user in user view it is a friend tender which is an applique user interface which is a frontend application view so that will be provided in mobile phones in the same way in the cars or in airplanes even in music players everything you can find every digital technology you can find the user interface etc so this user interface provides fundamental platform for humancomputer interaction it provides platform this user interface design provides a platform for humancomputer interaction and it is also a part of a software so this user interface can be graphically text based or audio based depending upon the hardware and the software combinations that you are using on the systems so the software becomes the software becomes most popular when you can say that software becomes more popular becomes most popular if its user interface is if its user interface is attractive simple to use responsive in short time responsive in short time and clear to understand clear to understand then only we can say that software becomes most popular so if you take any mobile phone okay in your mobile phone yeah i install some apps means some software you install so when you it becomes more popular when that app becomes most popular when that app is more attractive so if you if you are going to access that app that software means that is it which is consisting of some user interface so by seeing that app it suppose it is somewhat colorful and somewhat friendly if it is attractive it becomes more popular and if it is simple to use without complications the app is going to be used very simple okay so then it becomes most popular and the responsive in short time so this is one of the important while youre accessing anything any software the main thing it has to response in within a short time if suppose it is lagging means whenever you enter a button if the next page is opening it takes it takes some time okay you it be it doesnt becomes popular so when the software becomes most popular if its user interface is responsive in short time and if it user interface is clear to understand so whenever the user interface is attractive simple to use responsive in short time clear to understand then only you are software thats software whatever youre using that becomes most popular so the user interface user interface is broadly broadly divided into two categories so generally the user interface is divided into two categories so the one is command line interface command line interface so with the help of the command line prompt that is the command line prompt by youre you interacting with the software as well as the hardware so the user interface is broadly divided into either command line interface or you can go for the graphical user interface so with the help of the apps or with the help of some list of features you can interact directly with the software or hardware by using graphical user interface so the user interface may be command line interface or graphical user interface so this is about the user interface thank you
