postback data analytics application to talk about me alright i had started anodized canonical and sort of sort of as data into the areas classes visualization engineer written books and now im doing a training as well the books this is sort of based on agile data time 20 a thousand three really on a relative are six thousand may exist turn this into a video if you want to learn with you what we talked about tonight thats one x where im a component may be product and active because ive set up an attorney so very briefly of cover the theory of this sort of actually science big most pimples on application developers so data products are being assigned i actually leave that building at the fundamental skill for data scientists and that everyone whether the data scientist right should be a tutorial on viewing that name and everything you can then should be an application to them you know that same thing some of my over here is actually questions and so i did a survey on twitter yesterday and so about half bottles at least the missing amount so some support for this idea and so why do the science and big data i think if youre a data scientist and you build a model or a little app and you have to the absolutely build is to deploy it to get it into the business process to really make change at the company work yeah but you done something really wrong that you should be using big data tools as ill show you theyre not really less efficient and you can use the money on a computer so the goal of the methodology is the document and god explorer for data analysis to discover at all of the critical path to a compelling product so what is a critical tab theres this incredible task theory you might have seen my aunt char her chart critical path was like the next iteration of that were yet to sort of figure out how to get were not necessarily linear and so thats very important when youre going into x product theres a manifesto for agile they at times but it wont so go chris its about iteration a lot theres a eat around experiments that sort of structures top or the first thing to do is to plug records through front end to end from the way youre collecting them onto the web and app and then you can start with just enough people in chart so you can start sort of clean a tiger game visualizing project asking questions up next you sort of turn those into report so you extract enemies which will show you and for the roads between them at search instead of got interactivity in reports you can drill down spiral by the way either order to end up that order in which people pay for this so people will take a bit about anymore because that thats that and ultimately what they want to do so up next prediction during the command understand love it when you predict the future things that care a lot about and but ultimately what people care about anyway you actions thats why aii machinery so the tools that we used i used to be a fake fanatic people that like ask you to take music but archaeologic you ever played used in general if you can be working on spark you probably should most people watching is you dont have to wait five minutes or are simple you know the first line of the next thing that you and pipe are to me and your place page which is in the first edition of the book because the great api python python has really powerful tools for manipulating data versus your depth of growth but thats not good enough for many be speaking of the process is the way people are collecting data its also the way that theyre acting on data in real time and really sometimes it can take a few seconds to get work recently so what is no more focus i miss cassandra sort of wish i had but i also used to linkedin that where you could push a dataset from beneath to voldemort their inhouse key value store at in one operation that at the time there was no way to do that in any other database so i had to write the ability to do that entomology it is so simple actually could pull that off because everything in model if you look at the code its like oh my god to do that and so but as an optimist or like incredibly capable any database in existence including like the timing sequel db operation yeah any of those can act as the database for this app so i need to do it research elasticsearch is sort of a super spark occurs often really easy it doesnt get in your way and then the number of web frameworks sort of like rubys the natural flash is one of them i love it because theres a plug in if you do anything you dont have to reinvent the wheel but that is not an easel budget small that you have to learn to get something done you just define your web after is simply a network so the way the slowest data processing is your work we collect events with pasta we save them to a css or if youre in the cloud something like x3 we process the in match with the sign language spark publish back to mommy be be presentable flash and browser huge key chef is amazing its not on here but people each dress everything i made is really ugly now shes kind of its not my i mean my call i could get like a style each draft plugin is far as start those the beautiful ecosystem because you get spark and theres such people which ill talk about more you get people now without having to do separate tools like pig and hi you get spark and outlet which is very competitive with scikitlearn a lot of people use a single metal contact and you get a spark stream you have to share code between you things which is incredibly valuable yes in the book we do both and then that so i got lines of code for each to publish given tasks egyptian but yeah if you one chapter and boat and and move on to like just feeling spark ability because it became clear that the things you have a explosion i find its very competitive and it works with many machines for yet so i was a very dating up people die because it has got to eight people trying to do in it it really bit and so you know whether few people and those people in the whole preservation was a very big thing people when you get complex like this its really ugly and i cant follow it i can only do like one sub select before my brain box and but theres this data file programming which is good if youre doing something complex this is like page and you can count the email addresses between email addresses and so good that it sort of broken out but with spark to get you sequel and vehicle program so beautiful for women so we want to do select filter which is very convenient and our using people and here we do of how its not everybody because were looking at all the data but it has been bouncing that and vehicle program uses plot a histogram on that anita like its incredibly powerful to be able to both i was in love with peak but when i first used spark almost pride because ive been waiting five minutes or my life for five years and it was just joy on the big plan hold that and the data that we work with in this application is online performance data in the data flow select event so it was a great website almost data where its a rigorous description of everything but 99 of flights report wester on time miss choose faa and why they really so once i really analogy that gives it like why are our planes late usually and its usually the carriers fault but theres a whole lot of categories in there like im getting stick this is not their competence mister probably most of the time its not very common accident most likely reading apply plays because of previous licenses so this is the first three but this date is really cool theres tons of field analysis to do it but these are cons of the bunch of sorties and then theres the open file or database they give you information on air force air lines and route to be employed and then we scrape the faa registry this data is on the website so i actually get you put this script in the code the code by the way for all business freeze you can place it on the agenda thats great if i did include that in the script for the project that didnt want the site to go down so i just let you download the result but so hes created a excel number data we use python upto module to pull in descriptions of your lines that sort of thing and i thought this was going to go down and chompy and presently till theres nothing today because of climate chief weather data is available in a very convenient point through the last decade or two decades somebody i love an image i would export of the lower left on this guy reclining if hes like interviewed climbing his business at the top of the mountain think thats awesome dont question it no reclining the stack so working our way up the data by appearances for the app start by plumbing systems inning to end so what we do is to sort of to collect the data now were processing and publishing data to extra buted store which is mommies publishing like isaac kamalii needy and spark looks like this this is a helpful modulating forward we look the part a file to the grapes columnar format you dont have to you think but a blur which rigorously defined fields you can just sort of store things convert json to this comic format which automatically compresses it in the same way that you would have probably like a star schema especially monopoly because its a great corner and then you must be because a data frame is the new singing but the old sitting is an rdd you have to convert to that many stores and publishing records to elastic searches again two months behind two lines of code 100 resolved i did have to figure it as option alpha says it overloaded rating the the copy idea is one line but if you have like a hundreds of spark cluster and tunis mongodb cluster need to think before you use these two months of code but in this case theyre all live also compare the data set that option and so putting those records on the web is some flat import to the import time on where the  client define a route on a function for that route will appear on the web well rameters from weary strings get the data after this json turn runcam the plastic grid it looks like that but if you get a date on plugin for chrome away which i recommended for years so then were on to tables and charts this is how do you make a data table in high pot so we register the parkade bottle but you know the party files register it for people very direct are people you just call smart people when people that give us a data frame back you know you lurk back to the old format and stage tomorrow you have to be there for charging the college gift model and then make it plotting the data size ss data communication on the chart this is the controller and for flash model is great it could actually be quite complex and something like int and restoring the data so thats why you want to stand simple and we render the template this is the template most html we move through the flight and plot the row of columns element room and then get you this one others is very complex but it forms the basis for the high level this is the code for the chart this is the same thing but we return json that it when this template this looks complex but copied this from an example from my boss talked and edited three lines and thats how everyone does everything in d3 these people dont really talk about it but 95 of the trucks out there in the street start as an example of my boss back in there very super fun so that gives you this is highlighted one mode july popular so beyond that and start to build rapport with the explore data to the interaction this hasnt enough yet for my data button start with a homepage search is a great way to get started but no i think you should do data science evidence you act so so theyre tagged every play they dont want search and then you have pages per individual like airplane flight 71 routes airline one will show and they link between each other providing drill down and interactive there so this is the home page page about airlines activates be very surprised of the name but these are the airlock colors for all domestic airlines in us in a lot of that type the first story today is that two month wife doesnt do a lot of trees because this is the airline mc page so as i said we call descriptions on wikipedia to make extremely easy to do it innings  airplane pages by calendar and those internally flights by best airline its people providing their activities url the other thing that is great for a portal search engine elasticsearch make cd we do have to be a bit of how speedy provide like previous and next i couldnt find a good plug into flats i actually have to implement it you could use what i wrote with a little bit of trouble and then so we also start care for atomicity as a whole so this is that the airplanes paid with terrorizing us leads the first iteration anything any is some to take iterations so heres the second iteration where i got with a lot of tiny values that didnt really care about much more interested in who make up a fleet as a whole you can see here mcdonnell douglas it appeared mobile times and i overlap the other wheel also through iterations gets rid of the overlap and then the fourth iteration does any resolution to remove the duplicate ozma conferences now any resolution is really hard in general and really complicated and could be a zone top or series of top but in this case i got away with just okay with the first 10 characters and lets group on those and then projects the most common tag so patricia unemployed and then we get a charge that sort of is count blowing down the fleet of aircraft is a bit second and the tons of small things like all our gear prayer and you dont have to select the empty series so the next level is ridiculous but if you teaching for fun and profit or the curator so that architecture for the back ends of it is let me s horrible dedra on the gfs or in the cloud is actually on your computer and then you start the match model to train the model we predicted this and then these are streaming earlier so that it respond in real time to conjure funny model on real foundation and so it works really well actually this is sort of the top are sparks mike after you will set a tool in another system or something like that reemployment your model or creating your own wait absurd predictions from a model is not a lot of fun it could be either going to keep you quite bar but yeah this up so make sure to be back and get that lease of universal bottle is it it is its medium size lt delicious taking water step in it theres a new type of asset i forget the name of it but it will you can princeton pointed at a place minus 3 and if new records come into the file to make up that table so process them as a priority and to square it yeah thats a nice thing that i have to use digital edge i think its brandnew i personally havent you i dont think it is part of part 21 i put into context a lot of it is the site right now so this would still probably be the same because the like its possible to transfer data columns in real time all active learning but its much harder and theres you cant easily do it and so i think you would still train a batch and so this reviews there but definitely for many applications or new interesting way to process and so the client designs theyre your web page with a phone class and you have three serious which when you submit the form yes a lot of you deals and its a conservative class why ask me about jobs actually of adding all the fields that are in the training data that arent in the form like for instance the day a year the day upon these are features that ive had and so it then submits a request for a prediction lets pop a message in json everything in the json because ive never read it using json ever and i havent read music avro thrift and all of the others who might have ever used in some sort of like its something she doesnt fit into a json message just put in a block and youre like leave the fungal up and so start reading reading from the cost of you respond to make the prediction distorted and monarchy in the meet wildest i got a uuid from this end point that points them out a new url where he holds every section or however long walk and get it on with the prediction window guys you need time to just hold and so i think our building is model extreme vectorization so you tend to start with data that renders that feel and there get a number or strength what you need them into machine learning is matrix for vector format so in vector format each row is a record and each column here is a number but yet its like carrier the shading for nominal type oracle you have to inform the caching trick so every be thousand of that field yet be called so delta giving long everything at the column but all americans is one two best method for that row delta look like and on europe beijing for definition to the atlantic one for this record like that but overworked therefore chirality so this is 109 lines of code to trim them off note that scikitlearn 166 line sources 24 lines to get the ability to run this on as many machines as you want which is i think a small tax credibility and i think is at least as keen as i could learn although its not quite of teachers so if a prediction worked if it has a lot of value than your job becomes often ended or become someones job you could be a whole team full time job like with people you may know anything to drive an antibusiness and probably a paper and so this is butter that one person once it work and then i clear to a huge team that authorized it this is the performance of the model of counterpoint once i set or you have to then set up an experiment so that you can make one change to the model run the experiment and then check if it helped them out and so that is overhead us that in approximately here well add a lot of lanes and then the rest is we had to teach gypsy models so theres a lot of ways to improve a mod you can also search for hyperparameters things that arent optimized by the machine learning you have a sort of search for them at random essentially to figure out probably like a phd data find us with know what each one means i have no idea that my research look pretty much most people do and but yeah so it gets more complex but it feels not you know that much to do like for instance i was able to build labovick filter in squash mls in 20 lines of code does that recommend content based on history of recommendation remember literally 25 good in some ways more powerful than that doing wow i got to do it okay ah this is e and d question if you kind of doing on this hot be made as a basis of this the fundamentals on tv speaking in an equal sign with a professor but for running this is all day yes so the book covers everything from researching the algorithm to deployment into production you could literally take it try to tell to hear it doesnt perform very well but yeah and all walla valley chicago oil day often open oh you mean i even tie sparkles opposed to now jupiter im trying to integrate deeper to notebook into this process to theyre circling class process and they just released in i havent gotten is working that yes they definitely have their place they arent interactive and you cant drill down and you cant search and so theres some above it and you cant serve predictions but for report and like i fear something we use them in the book actually like to create the initial model now theres charts and things where so that yet is theyre awesome but im trying to integrate them into this whole stack that havent each other yeah theyre off yeah and ultimately if i just like sort of think about how to build tools that enable this process yeah that might be one the ability to kind of take up something from a cheaper another book and turn it into something interesting im not sure okay thank you very much applause
