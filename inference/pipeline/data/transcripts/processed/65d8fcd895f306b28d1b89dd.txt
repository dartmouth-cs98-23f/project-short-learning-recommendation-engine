lecture on computer architecture today i want to talk to you about quantum computing something that is well not state of the art it is more like beyond state of the art it is into still in the development phase so its not even clear if its going to work but let me try to explain to you what is going on and why it would be phenomenal if it really works so the first thing i want to actually uh i want to tell you what it is actually based on what do we have is um that in a normal computer we have lets say an and gate in which every bit there it enters and it has the bit can have two values its either one or it is zero and that is then linked to a physical property so for instance the zero is zero volts and the one is five volts or maybe uh the zero is that the capacitor is charged and uh one is that the capacitor is empty or the other way around whatever but with quantum computing there is something strange going on because the bits that we put at the input cannot have either one of the two values but it can have two values at the same time and that is something very strange but that comes from quantum mechanics so the idea is that you have an object of physical property that can have various states so we can for instance take here the classic example is that you can have here an electron spin and as you know well maybe not but the electron spin it can either rotate in one direction lets say here counterclockwise or this is this is clockwise and the other one would be counterclockwise and we could for instance say well we can just say that counterclockwise would be zero and clockwise would be one so maybe we call this one here on the left we call it uh then one and the other one on the right and we call it a zero and then were going to make some kind of they arrive at our end gate and were going to do some kind of well boolean logic with that but the thing is that in quantum mechanics the electron state is not defined spin up or spin down is not defined until it is measured and it is not so that the state of the spin is not known to us but it is a certain state it is up or down but only its not observed by me no that would be classical mechanics classical physics but in quantum physics it is like this that no the state is not defined until it is measured until it is socalled observed so then before you observe it it is like you know mr schroedingers cat it is both the cat of mr uh both that that and the life at the same time at the same time the same way the spin of the electron is both up and down at the same time and that means that uh and when we start observing it then the spin socalled it the wave function as we call it it collapses so only when we observe it the spin becomes up or down and if you think this concept is strange i would like to remind you of mr the famous talk of mr feynman where he said if you think you understand quantum mechanics you dont understand quantum mechanics and this is how weird actually this you can make these weird phrases and actually being right on top i really recommend you to watch if youre interested into these kind of things the lecture series of mr richard feynman its in black and white very oldfashioned but the quality i think is not been surpassed by any uh any person from physics since that time so this black and white videos are perfect and there he says i think the lectures are called the character of physical nature or something like this but anyway there he says nobody understands quantum mechanics that is mr feynman saying that so in quantum mechanics the state is not defined until we observe it and until the time the state is in the wave function is in a superposition state so it is both spin up and spin down at the same time when we use electrons so how can we use this now to make a quantum computer well we take these two things so let me put it back here let me say it like this so we have generally we have a wave function that that a bit a at the entrance of our gate it would be both in the spin up and the spin down state because we didnt observe it yet but were already going to do calculations with this wave function before observing it so we apply the wave function to our gate and then we are doing simultaneously the calculations with the spin up state as well as the spin down state so one bit of information actually i should say this one bit arriving at your gate actually has two bits of processing information now how does we then do this if we take two bits then we have four calculations doing at the same time and if we have 100 bits then we do 2 to the power 100 calculations at the same time because we didnt collapse the wave function yet and to give you an idea then just a simple computer of 100 bits so maybe we would have something like this i think this is the ibm quantum computing machine and you can see well its quite complex maybe this has 100 bits i guess this entire thing has to be cooled down to liquid helium or something like this because it looks to me that this one will be embedded into into some kind of cooling vessel because of this you can see this thermal shields that are there and then the electronic wires that come here through here and through loops so that the thermal conductivity is not so high and here at the bottom then the calculation is done at very low temperature because then you have apparently you can do this quantum states well you can imagine that this thing must cost a fortune but if you have 100 bits then you can do 2 to the power 100 calculations in simultaneous simultaneously and to give you an idea that is about 2 to the power 100 is about 10 to the power 30 so if you do one calculation per second effectively youre doing 10 to the power 30 calculations per second and that is then about 10 to the power 20 10 gigahertz scores in parallel so you can get the idea as if you have 10 to the power 20 very strong computers working uh in in parallel i dont think that there are so many computers in the world and actually in the this would be its like astronomical amounts of processing power if you just have 100 bits to be honest im quite skeptical but im just explaining to you how it works to be honest im quite skeptical because obviously nature didnt do this and and the advantages would be very well in nature imagine that youre a lion or actually youre the prey of the lion it would be if you have such calculating power in your brain or somehow then of course you would be able to predict lets say the future for the next uh one or two hours uh with high precision so you could be able to either avoid the lion or as when youre the lion you could easily catch your prey so im very skeptical that it works but this is the principle of of how it works so that is quantum computing it might be that this will then be the end of things like bitcoin or blockchain in general cryptography because you can instantly calculate all the possible cryptographic possibilities so decrypting is actually then a piece of cake so see you in the next lecture well i will talk about a clockless computer so i will actually talk about your brain which doesnt have a clock as you know see you in the next lecture
