meaning of the phrases artificial intelligence   machine learning deep  learning and computer vision    we will learn how they are related and how they are different dr john mccarthy coined the phrase artificial  intelligence in a proposal published   on august 31st 1955 thats a long time  back artificial intelligence is the idea   of making machines think and learn like humans it  does not tell us how to do it it is just the idea early ai techniques were rulebased   they were called expert systems  and they were nothing more than a series of if this do that rules if you  find this do something if you find that do   something else soon the number of rules became  overwhelming for even moderately complex tasks   it was very difficult to put these rules together  so researchers started asking what if the machines   could learn by looking at data instead of  trying to be programmed explicitly with rules   this idea of machines learning from  data is called machine learning  there are many different  machine learning algorithms   and some of them are based on neural networks early neural networks contained  three layers an input layer   for receiving input an output  layer and a third hidden layer these neural networks could solve simple  problems but the media and some overly   optimistic researchers hyped up their capabilities  so obviously these networks did not live up to   their lofty expectations and there was a lot of  disappointment and neural networks became a dirty   word in ai however people working in the field  were making good progress they discovered that   they could get fantastic results if they train  neural networks with many hidden layers and this   architecture was called deep neural networks the  deep stands for the many hidden layers in the   network but neural networks had become uncool they  were very unpopular and so it needed rebranding   in 2006 dr geoffrey hinton coined the  phrase deep learning now that is cool so deep   learning is a subset of machine learning where  problems are solved using deep neural networks   now whats computer vision roughly speaking it  is the field of research and development that   helps computers see computer vision deals with  interpreting visual data like images and videos   these images could be from different sources like  a regular camera a depth camera a thermal camera   an electron microscope or an xray machine  a radio telescope and many more within   computer vision we solved many problems like face  recognition image classification object detection   text detection and recognition 3d reconstruction  of scenes photographing a black hole   yeah that too so computer vision is not a subset  of artificial intelligence but they have a huge   overlap many problems in computer vision  are solved using machine learning including   deep learning but many other problems are solved  without any ai techniques for example creating a   panorama is part of computer vision but it usually  does not involve any ai the same is true about 3d   reconstruction algorithms so now lets summarize  what we have learned artificial intelligence or   ai is the science and engineering of making  machines learn think and act like humans   machine learning is a subset of ai where  machines learn directly from data instead   of handcoded rules deep learning is a subfield  of machine learning where machines learn using   deep neural networks and finally computer vision  is the science and engineering of interpreting   visual data many computer vision problems  are solved using ai but many others are not   thats all friends if you like this video  please subscribe to our channel and dont   forget to turn on notification by hitting the  bell icon well see you in the next video   this is satya mallick signing off your guide to  the fascinating world of computer vision and ai thank you
