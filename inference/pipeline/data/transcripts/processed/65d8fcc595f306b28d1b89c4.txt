machine learning versus deep learning versus artificial intelligence some of the most exciting technologies evolving in todays world my name is richard kirschner and ill be hosting this talk or simply learn before we start covering the basics of these three topics and how they connect and how they are different lets just look at a few examples so we get an understanding of whats going on heres an example of artificial intelligence in todays world amazon echo amazon echo is a wonderful tool we can go in there and you can say hey alexa whats the temperature in chicago and the amazon echo then translates that into zeros and ones and something the computer understands then it comes in and processes that information to identify what youre asking and what you need and where to get that information and then it comes back and says the current temperature in chicago is six degrees fahrenheit or whatever it is at the moment so this is a wonderful example of artificial intelligence that were using right now today where thats at as far as a commercial deployment machine learning a machine learning example out there is google youre on your google search engine it comes up you spend a lot of time on the first link you come into and you read the page and google looks at that and says okay he spent five minutes on this lets give it a thumbs up and then you go to the second page and the third page you just kind of skip over them and glance at them for a couple seconds and google says i wasnt interested in those pages lets give them a thumbs down so this is a good example of machine learning as it starts guessing what you like and what you dont like so it gives you more information along what youre going to read and actually use and then we have an example of deep learning in this example we have a black and white image it comes into in this case a neural network some people like to call it a magic box because you really its hard to follow all thats going on in there theres all these different weights and connections and nodes and then it comes out and colors the beach ball the people the background whats going on in here is the black and white image goes into this neural network and before its ever gone in the neural network has looked at all these different pictures on the web or wherever it pulls the data from and its already itemized them and kind of separated them that we have some that look like beach balls we have some that look like people and it programs that so that when the black and white image comes in it goes okay that piece right there resembles this and all these other photos and the network is able to identify that and then color the beach ball with the colors that you see on there so it gives it this is really wonderful because they did a wonderful job coloring this picture and thats the full setup is where the deep learning example comes in and they usually center around neural networks so we looked at a few examples whats in it for you first were going to talk about human versus artificial intelligence this is very important because this is our marker we as humans are amazing and so we want to understand how artificial intelligence compares and what it does that it can accelerate above humans and how it can integrate with the human experience what is machine learning and deep learning all about are they really all that different well have a few more examples in here and then well talk a little bit about types of ai and machine learning and comparing machine learning in deep learning and finally a glimpse into the future human versus artificial intelligence humans are amazing lets just face it were amazing creatures were all over the planet were exploring every nic chinook weve gone to the moon weve gone into outer space were just amazing creatures were able to use the available information to make decisions to communicate with other people identify patterns and data remember what people have said adapt to new situations so lets take a look at this so we so you can get a picture youre a human being so you know its like to be human lets take a look at artificial intelligence versus the human artificial intelligence develops computer systems that can accomplish texts that require human intelligence so were looking at this one of the things that computers can do they can provide more accurate results this is very important recently i did a project on cancer whereas identifying markers and as a human being you look at that and you might be looking at all the different images and the data that comes off of them and say i like this person so i want to give them a very good outlook and the next person you might not like so you want to give him a bad outlook well with artificial intelligence youre going to get a consistent prediction of whats going to come out interacts with humans using their natural language weve seen that as probably the biggest development feature right now thats in the commercial market that everybody gets to use as we saw with the example of alexa they learn from their mistakes and adapt to new environments so we see this slowly coming in more and more and they learn from the data and automate repetitive learning repetitive learning has a lot to do with the neural networks you have to program thousands upon thousands of pictures in there and its all automated so as todays computers evolve its very quick and easy and affordable to do this what is machine learning and deep learning all about imagine this say you had some time to waste not that any of us really have a lot of time anymore to just waste in todays world and youre sitting by the road and you have a whole lot of and a whole lot of time passes by theres a few hours and suddenly you wonder how many cars buses trucks and so on passed by in the six hours now chances are youre not going to sit by the road for six hours and count buses cars and trucks unless youre working for the city and youre trying to do city planning and you want to know hey do we need to add a new truck route maybe we need a bicycle length we have a lot of bicyclists here that kind of thing so maybe city planning would be great for this machine learning well the way machine learning works is we have labeled data with features okay so you have a truck or a car a motorcycle a bus or a bicycle and each one of those are labeled it comes in and based on those labels and comparing those features it gives you an answer its a bicycle its a truck its a motorcycle this is a little bit more in depth on this and the model here it actually the features were looking at would be like the tires someone sits there and figures out what a tire looks like it takes a lot of work if you try to try to figure the difference between a car tire a bicycle tire a motorcycle tire so in the machine learning field this could take a long time if youre going to do each individual aspect of a car and try to get a result on there and thats what they did do that was a very this is still used on smaller amounts of data where you figure out what those features are and then you label them deep learning so with deep learning one of our solutions is to take a very large unlabeled data set and we put that into a training model using artificial neural networks and then that goes into the neural network itself when we create a neural network and youll see the arrows are actually kind of backward but which actually is a nice point because when we train the neural network we put the bicycle in and then it comes back and says if its a truck it comes back and says well you need to change that to bicycle and then it changes all those weights going backward they call it back propagation and let it know its a bicycle and thats how it learns once youve trained the neural network you then put the new data in and they call this testing the model so you need to have some data youve kept off to the side where you know the answer to and you take that and you provide the required output and you say okay is this is this neural network working correctly did it identify a bike as a bike a truck as a truck a motorcycle as a motorcycle lets just take a little closer look at that determining what objects are present in the data so how does deep learning do this and here we have the image of the bike its 28 by 28 pixels thats a lot of information there could you imagine trying to guess that this is a bicycle image by looking at each one of those pixels and trying to figure out whats around it and we actually do that as human beings its pretty amazing we know what a bicycle is and even though it comes in as all this information and what this looks like is the image comes in it converts it into a bunch of different nodes in this case theres a lot more than what they show here and it goes through these different layers and out comes and says okay this is a bicycle a lot of times they call this the magic black box why because as we watch it go across here all these weights and all the math behind this and its not its a little complicated on the math side you really dont need to know that when youre programming or doing working with the deep learning but its like magic you dont know you really cant figure out whats going to come out by looking whats in each one of those dots and each one of those lines are firing and whats going in between them so we like to call it the magic box uh so thats where deep learning comes in and in the end it comes up and you have this whole neural network comes up and says okay we fire all these different pixels and we connects all these different dots and gives them different weights and says okay this is a bicycle and thats how we determine what the object is present in the data with deep learning machine learning were going to take a step into machine learning here and youll see how these fit together in a minute the system is able to make predictions or take decisions based on past data thats very important for machine learning is that were looking at stuff and based on whats been there before were creating a decision on there were creating something out of there were coloring a beach ball were telling you what the weather is in chicago whats nice about machine learning is a very powerful processing capability its quick and accurate outcomes so you get results right away once you program the system the results are very fast and the decisions and predictions are better theyre more accurate theyre consistent you can analyze very large amounts of data some of these data things that theyre analyzing now are petabytes and terabytes of data it would take hundreds of people hundreds of years to go through some of this data and do the same thing that the machine learning can do in a very short period of time and its inexpensive compared to hiring hundreds of people so it becomes a very affordable way to move into the future is to apply the machine learning to whatever businesses youre working on and deep learning systems think and learn like humans using artificial neural networks again its like a magic box performance improves with more data so the more data the deep learning gets the more it gives you better results its scalability so you can scale it up you can scale it down you can increase what youre looking at currently you know were limited by the amount of computer processing power as to how big that can get but that envelope continually gets pushed every day on what it can do problem solved in an endtoend method so instead of having to break it apart and you have the first piece coming in and you identify tires and the second piece is identifying labeling handlebars and then you bring that together that if it has handlebars and tires its a bicycle and if it has something that looks like a large square its probably a truck the neural networks does this all in one network you dont really know whats going on in all those weights and all those little bubbles but it does it pretty much in one package thats why the neural network systems are so big nowadays and coming into their own best features are selected by the system and it this is important they kind of put it its on a bullet on the side here its a subset of machine learning this is important we talk about deep learning it is a form of machine learning theres lots of other forms of machine learning data analysis but this is the newest and biggest thing that they apply to a lot of different packages and they use all the other machine learning tools available to work with it and its very fast to test you put in your information you then have your group of tests and then you held some aside you see how does it do its very quick to test it and see whats going on with your deep learning in your neural network are they really all that different ai versus machine learning versus deep learning concepts of ai so we have concepts of iii youll see natural language processing machine learning an approach to create artificial intelligence so its one of the subsets of artificial intelligence knowledge representation automated reasoning computer vision robotics machine learning versus ai versus deep learning or ai and machine learning and deep learning so we look at this we have ai with machine learning and deep learning and so were going to put them all together we find out that ai is the big picture we have a collection of books it goes through some deep learning the digital data is analyzed text mining comes through the particular book youre looking for maybe its a genre books is identified and in this case we have a robot that goes and gives a book to the patron i have yet to be at a library that has a robot bring me a book but that will be cool when it happens as we look at some of the pieces here this information goes into theres as far as this example the translation of the handwritten printed data to digital form thats pretty hard to do thats pretty hard to go in there and translate hundreds and hundreds of books and understand what theyre trying to say if youve never read them so in this case we use the deep learning because you can already use examples where theyve already classified a lot of books and then they can compare those texts and say oh okay this is a book on automotive repair this is a book on robotic building the digital data is in analyzed then we have more text mining using machine learning so maybe wed use a different program to do a basic classify what youre looking for and say oh youre looking for auto repair and computers so youre looking for automated cars once its identified then of course it brings you the book so heres a nice summation of what we were just talking about ai with machine learning and deep learning deep learning is a subset of machine learning which is a subset of artificial intelligence so you can look at artificial intelligence as the big picture how does this compare to the human experience in either doing the same thing as a human we do or it does it better than us and machine learning which has a lot of tools uh is something that learns from data past experiences its programmed its uh comes in there and it says hey we already had these five things happen the sixth one should be about the same and then theres a lot of tools in machine learning but deep learning then is a very specific tool in machine learning its the artificial neural network which handles large amounts of data and is able to take huge pools of experiences pictures and ideas and bring them together real life examples artificial intelligence news generation very common nowadays as it goes through there and finds the news articles or generates the news based upon the news feeds or the back end coming in and says okay lets give you the actual news based on this theres all the different things amazon echo they have a number of different prime music on there of course theres also the google command and theres also cortana theres tons of smart home devices now where we can ask it to turn the tv on or play music for us thats all artificial intelligence from front to back youre having a human experience with these computers and these objects that are connected to the processing machine learning spam detection very common machine learning doesnt really have the human interaction part so this is the part where it goes and says okay thats a spam thats not a spam and it puts it in your spam folder search engine result refining another example of of machine learning whereas it looks at your different results and it go and it is able to categorize them as far as it said the most hits this is the least viewed this has five stars you know however they want to weight it all exactly good examples of machine learning and then the deep learning uh deep learning another example is as you have like a exit sign in this case is translating it into french sorti i hope i said that right neural network has been programmed with all these different words and images and so its able to look at the exit in the middle and it goes okay we want to know what that is in french and its able to push that out in france french and learn how to do that and then we have chat bots i remember when microsoft first had their little paper clip um boy that was like a long time ago they came up and you would type in there and chat with it these are growing you know its nice to just be able to ask a question and it comes up and gives you the answer and instead of it being were you just doing a search on certain words its now able to start linking those words together and form a sentence in that chat box types of ai and machine learning types of artificial intelligence this in the next few slides are really important so one of the types of artificial intelligence is reactive machines systems that only react they dont form memories they dont have past experiences they have something that happens to them and they react to it my washing machine is one of those if i put a ton of clothes in it and it all clumped on one side it automatically adds a weight to recenter it so that my washing machine is actually a reactive machine working with whatever the load is and keeps it nice and so when it spins it doesnt go thumping against the side limited memory another form of artificial intelligence systems look into the past information is added over a period of time and information is shortlived when were talking about this and you look at like a neural network thats been programmed to identify cars it doesnt remember all those pictures it has no memory as far as the hundreds of pictures you process through it all it has is this is the pattern i use to identify cars as the final output for that neural network we looked at so when they talk about limited memory this is what theyre talking about theyre talking about ive created this based on all these things but im not going to remember anyone specifically theory of mind systems being able to understand human emotions and how they affect decision making to adjust their behaviors according to their human understanding this is important because this is our page mark this is how we know whether it is an artificial intelligence or not is it interacting with humans in a way that we can understand without that interaction is just an object so we talk about theory of mind we really understand how it interfaces that whole if youre in web development user experience would be the term i would put in there so the theory of mine would be user experience hows the whole ui connected together and one of the final things is as we get into artificial intelligence is systems being aware of themselves understanding their internal states and predicting other peoples feelings and act appropriately so as artificial intelligence continues to progress we see ones that are trying to understand what makes people happy how would they increase our happiness how would they keep themselves from breaking down if somethings broken inside they have that selfawareness to be able to fix it and just based on all that information predicting which action would work the best what would help people if i know that youre having a cup of coffee first thing in the morning is what makes you happy as a robot i might make you a cup of coffee every morning at the same time to help your life and help you grow thatd be the selfawareness is being able to know all those different things types of machine learning and like i said on the last slide this is very important this is very important if you decide to go in and get certified in machine learning or know more about it these are the three primary types of machine learning the first one is supervised learning systems are able to predict future outcome based on past data requires both an input and an output to be given to the model for it to be trained so in this case were looking at anything where you have 100 images of a bicycle and those hundred images you know are bicycle so its their presets someone already looked at all hundred images and said these are pictures of bicycles and so the computer learns from those and then its given another picture and maybe the next picture is a bicycle and it says oh that resembles all these other bicycles so its a bicycle and the next ones a car and it says thats not a bicycle that would be supervised learning because we had to train it we had to supervise it unsupervised learning systems are able to identify hidden patterns from the input data provided by making the data more readable and organized the patterns similarities or anomalies become more evident youll heard the term cluster how do you cluster things together some of these things go together some of these dont this is unsupervised where you can look at an image and start pulling the different pieces of the image out because they arent the same the human all the parts of the human are not the same as a fuzzy tree behind them just slightly out of focus which is not the same as the beach ball its unsupervised because we never told it what a beach ball was we never told them what the human was and we never told it that those were trees all we told it was hey separate this picture by things that dont match and things that do match and come together and finally theres reinforcement learning systems are given no training it learns on the basis of the reward punishment it received for performing its last action it helps increase the efficiency of a tool function or a program reinforced learning a reinforcement learning is kind of you give it a yes or no yes you give me the right response no you didnt and then it looks at that and says oh okay so based on this data coming in what i gave you was a wrong response so next time ill give you a different one comparing machine learning and deep learning so remember that deep learning is a subcategory of machine learning so its one of the many tools and so they were grouping a ton of machine learning tools all together linear regression k means clustering theres all kinds of cool tools out there you can use in machine learning enables machines to take decisions to make decisions on their own based on past data enables machines to make decisions with the help of artificial neural networks so its doing the same thing but were using an artificial neural network as opposed to one of the more traditional machine learning tools needs only a small amount of training data this is very important when youre talking about machine learning theyre usually not talking about huge amounts of data were talking about maybe your spreadsheet from your business and your totals for the end of the year when youre talking about neural networks you usually need a large amount of data to train the data so theres a lot of training involved if you have under 500 points of data thats probably not going to go into machine learning or maybe you have like the case of one of the things 500 points of data and 30 different fields it starts getting really confusing there in artificial intelligence or machine learning and the deep learning aspect really shines when you get to that larger data thats really complex works well on a low end systems so a lot of the machine learning tools out there you can run on your laptop with no problem and do the calculations there where with the machine learning usually needs a higher end system to work it takes a lot more processing power to build those neural networks and to train them it goes through a lot of data were talking about the general machine learning tools most features need to be identified in advanced and manually coded so theres a lot of human work on here the machine learns the features from the data it is provided so again its like a magic box you dont have to know what a tire is it figures it out for you the problem is divided into parts and solved individually and then combined so machine learning you usually have all these different tools and use different tools for different parts and the problem is solved in an endtoend manner so you only have one neural network or two neural networks that is bringing the data in and putting it out its not going through a lot of different processes to get there and remember you can put machine learning and deep learning together so you dont always have just the deep learning solving the problem by having selling one piece of the puzzle with regular machine learning and most machine learning tools out there they take longer to test and understand how they work and with the deep learning its pretty quick once you build that neural network you test it and you know so were dealing with very crisp rules limited resources you have to really explain how the decision was made when you use most machine learning tools but when you use the deep learning tool inside the machine learning tools the system takes care of it based on its own logic and reasoning and again its like a magic black box you really dont know how it came up with the answer you just know it came up with the right answer a glimpse into the future so a quick glimpse into the future artificial intelligence using it to detecting crimes before they happen humanoid ai helpers which we already have a lot of therell be more and more maybe itll actually be androids thatd be cool to have an android that comes and gets stuff out of my fridge for me machine learning increasing efficiency in healthcare thats really big in all the forms of machine learning better marketing techniques any of these things if we get into the sciences its just off the scale machine learning and artificial intelligence go everywhere and then the subcategory deep learning increased personalization so whats really nice about the deep learning is its going to start now catering to you thatll be one of the things we see more and more of and well have more of a hyper intelligent personal assistant im excited about that what we have learned so far we covered artificial intelligence in this case the ai versus the human we did a lot of that so we have a page marker of human interaction we discussed machine learning and all their different parts and then we discussed the deep learning aspect we went into ai and machine learning and deep learning how theyre all subcategories of each other very important to remember that artificial intelligence is a big picture machine learning is a category in artificial intelligence and then deep learning is a tool in machine learning we talked of all the aspects in the machine learning and deep learning and how they compare and we took a quick glimpse into the future and all the different im sure you can come up with many more examples of where its coming out in our future we looked at a few of them so you have some ideas of where this is going and all the different wonderful opportunities are going to come out with it i would like to thank you for more information
