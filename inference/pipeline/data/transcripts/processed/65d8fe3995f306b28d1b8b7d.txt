in this video i am going to explain sdlc that is software development life cycle if we talk about this topic or even if talk about software engineering this subject is a lot in demand we get a lot of comments we also get a lot of mails that start this subject but if tell you personally and genuinely i had not started this subject because i have not studied this subject with heart whenever we used to study this subject in btech or whenever we have studied we have studied just to pass the exam we always used to feel that this is theory so you can just mug up the theory what is its importance in real life where is it used what is its purpose actually that we had not seen actually we had never felt but if i talk now then i can tell you now that yes actually i am telling with my own experience that this subject has got a lot of importance if i give its real life example then when we do a startup or if we go in entrepreneurship then actually we come to know that this theory is quite important we actually complete phases one by one and i will tell all these points with my own experience with real life example so that you dont find it boring you come to know that yes actually it is important  the theory that we study  that is actually important  so that i am telling you first of all we will talk about software development life cycle  because i have already made a video on the basic so the first important topic that comes is  software development life cycle  in which we talk about there is a cycle  cycle means we have different phases  we are developing a software through those phases  and to develop a software a cycle or a systematic way  why is it necessary  because customer is investing his time and his money  and the company which is providing him service  somewhere it has to make its name  so that it can get multiple projects  so somewhere the requirement of customer  we have to satisfy it properly  we have to properly implement the requirement of customer  and my cost also should be genuine  i have to work within time frame  so when we have to do all these things actually in real life  when we need a systematic approach  that is actually a software development life cycle  over here we have 2 entities  one is the customer  there are 2 people one is customer and another is the service provider  there can be one customer also and multiple customer also  and a service provider obviously there is a very big team  small team can also be there  that depends but if we see a general aspect  then there is a customer and a service provider  so over here as we are making our platform  so we are the customer and the company with which we have done the tie up is a service provider  so which is the first phase planning phase  planning phase means it is initial time  when we have an idea in mind that we are doing this work  we have this unique idea  we implemented that idea in market  as we talk about youtube  our channel is quite famous  now we want that we can provide many good courses to students through this channel and it is not that only one thing  like if i talk about myself  then only i cannot do all the things  because we also have our quality constraint  that we have to give the best quality  so i cannot teach all the things alone  i also have to bring multiple instructors  each and everything i have to do  so over there comes a planning phase  i want all those things in planning phase i want this type of dashboard students should be able to login like this  in that which type of content students should get  how will they get pdf  how will they get video lectures  how they can give quiz how should be the landing page  this comes in our mind  this is my planning  now along with that planning i also know that  how much cost i can give  how much time do i have  in that i have kept an idea in my mind  now what will i do i will call  obviously nowadays in social media and online also marketing is available  so over there i can put that  that this is my requirement  so tell me if anyone has such a company  or if any person is working on this  then tell me  obviously multiple service provider will reach me  they will call me  so over there the first phase will be there of planning  and then what they will do  i will get quotations from them  tell me how much cost will be incurred  i will tell all the things to them so you can see over here our verbal communication will be there  informal or formal kind of communication can be done  defensive the project is very big then obviously formal will be more  if it is a limited or small project  then informal kind of communication will also do  and after that when i have told all my things  so after that comes defining or analysis phase now a person has an idea in his mind  service provider has got an idea in his mind   that this is customers requirement now we will share that requirement with his team  after sharing it with team  he will get an estimation that i can keep this much price  i will require this much staff  the estimation work cocomo and line of code  function point  all that funda comes on this point  what you will do all the analysis on the basis of which he will tell this will be my cost  i will take this much charges  i will take this much time  then customer will tell about him  that i can pay only this much money  or i want to get the work done within this much time  so somewhere they will do the negotiation  now after doing the negotiation  nawab after that a proper documentation comes that is called as srs documentation  it comes over here in this phase  when they had communication with each other  verbal communication is done  but in the end i want it in written so in return we got a formal document from them  but these will be the modules and we have told them each and everything  but it does not mean that over here customers work is over  now customer cannot do any changes  customers can do his changes afterwards also  but what happens is customer might tell something earlier  and after that he keeps on making the changes again and again  so somewhere you will be stuck in this loop only  over here only customer and service provider will be stuck  so you can tell that 7060 idea is to be delivered  it is there in his mind  now whatever changes you want to add on in this  that you will keep on doing it  according to the time  so this srs document work is done  after that designing phase comes  what comes in designing phase  now in this the customer does not have any major role  service provider has a major role  designing phase cohesion and coupling comes  which functions are there  how are the modules  what will be the cohesion and coupling between them  other than this if we talk dfds and all  if you make any project in your university or college  you might have used dfd and uml in it  so that comes in designing phase now if i talk about real life example in designing phase you will get a lot in theory  if i talk about real life example  so it is possible that somewhere  let you can tell design at your end  i want this designing  i want this type of front page i want this type of landing page  you told each and everything  may be you took example of 3 to 4 website and told them  that i want this type of work  you can bring more advancement in this  in the same way service provider also told you that  we will do designing in this way  these are the phases  each and everything came over there in designing phase  designing helps in coding and implementation part  it is not that the coding person will directly start coding the srs document  let us not like that  in designing phase a whole layout is prepared  let i want to make things this way  and these are my platforms  they have made a layout and designing phase  like we make a map before making the house  from an architect  designing phase is similar  and if we talk about dbms  like er modelling that comes in designing phase  now later on it will be added to the implementation phase you will put it in coding phase which platform you are using  at backend which technology you are actually using  which language you are using  all that things come over here  so somewhere service provider will use latest technique and technologies  he will do this coding and implementation part  then testing  very important phase because  whatever project you have  it is not that the project is deployed  we have launched it in the market  that means it will be a hit  and all the things that we want will be working  no when actually the product comes into the market  then we actually come to know that it has some problem  when it will come in the hand of customer  and customer will give it to its users ahead  when users tell on daily basis  that actually these are the changes  these things are missing in it so somewhere the testing phase  there are many type of testing  unit testing is there integration testing is there  there are different levels  other than that system testing alpha beta  if we talk about types of testing  white box testing is there black box testing is there  so they are the different types  but if you talk about deployment  okay your product is delivered  testing and all is done  you have deployed it  properly  and along with that also maintenance comes  in maintenance generally technical support comes  if i talk in real life example  then they give it to you like technical support they give you time of 3 months  after delivering they will give you a complete demo  that it works in this way  you tell your users how to log in  each and everything they will tell you  and they will also give you time of 3 to 4 months  that whatever changes you want to get done in 3 to 4 months  you get it done  and if you want to do anything after that  then there are also some charges on that basis  those charges can be on yearly basis  they can also be on monthly basis  that depends  then the maintenance fund comes  after that the whole cycle  is completed  now over here if we talk and anywhere it is asked to you in college or university exam  or in any interview  so i feel this from my experience  yes in real life actually it is important  because we think this as a theory part  baby still you might feel it as a theory part  but later on when you will work in a software company  or as a startup or when you will go as an entrepreneur  then you will actually feel that this thing is very important  this tells you how you have to work in a systematic way  or how you have to make your employees work  or the company with which you have done the tie up  how you have to give them input  how you have to arrange meetings with them  how in a proper way  your platform your website  your app each and everything  you want to get it developed  so this whole concept  this is actually called the software development life cycle  and this if you talk from olden times till now  there are many different models  like waterfall model  it is very important waterfall model  in which iterative waterfall is also there or if we talk about  your traditional waterfall model is there  then prototype is there  spiral model is there  then rad is there other then that vmodel is there agile is there latest technology so these are the different models in it  again that is also a theoretical part  but i am actually telling you the scenario  that how do we implement it  what is its importance in real life  thank you
