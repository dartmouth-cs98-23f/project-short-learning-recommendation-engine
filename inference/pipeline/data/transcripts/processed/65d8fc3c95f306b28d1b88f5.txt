previous session we discuss about risk management topic with example i have mentioned complete software engineering subject playlist link in below description box now in todays session we will discuss the next important topic that is software configuration management as per your exam point of view this is one of the most important topic lets start the session in this session we will discuss about sem their importance process repository their functions and tools at the end we will discuss some important questions that have asked in previous year question paper lets see all these points one by one now the first thing is what exactly scm scm stands for software configuration management c while developing a particular software project you must use software development life cycle there are various phases like requirement gathering and planning analysis design implementation testing maintenance etc now while developing a particular project there are various changes that occur at each phase of sdlc the changes related to the customer requirements changes in software team or the organization changes in government policies and roles or sometimes changes in project schedule now to handle and monitor all these changes for that purpose software configuration management process is used as per the definition scm is processed for systematically manage organize and control all the changes in documents codes and other entities in sdlc to monitor all these changes are necessary because it affect on your programming code your project planning then your testing data and other database to handle all these configuration items there are different scm tools are available like puppet config hub then solstack ansible git bitbucket docker these tools are used by the configuration manager to handling all the configuration data the primary goal of scm is to increase productivity with minimal mistakes now the next topic is importance of scm and the main importance is configuration manager ensure that all the changes occur in software project are properly planned tested and integrated into the final product it also helps software team members to collaborate and coordinated their work lets take one example suppose there are new whatsapp updates are available so at that time you update your whatsapp from the google play store so at that time there are new features are available right so this scm process manage and track different versions of particular software system they also ensure that everyone working from the same version of software system also help in deployment phase of software development life cycle they maintain environment on the client side while developing a particular product basically it improve quality and reliability of software system it also increase efficiency and reduce the risk of errors in particular software project so this is the importance of scm in software engineering now the next topic is scm process as per your exam point of view this is one of the most important topic there are total value steps in scm process like identification version control change control configuration audit and reporting this sem processor handled by the project manager configuration manager developer and the end user now lets discuss scm process in detail now the first step of sem process is planning and identification here configuration manager identify the scope and objective of particular software project for that purpose they arrange meeting group discussion brainstorming session with your software team and different stakeholders configuration manager identify different test cases requirements different models and schedule time of particular project they also identify software configuration items means which type of hardware resources software resources and human resources are used in particular project basically they maintain a details of why when and what changes will be occur in particular project and by whom this all changes are performed they identify and analyze all these details they also mention proper naming convention to each and every file see here instead of naming a file loginphp you should give a file name login v12 php here v12 stands for version number of file c every time new features are added in particular project so also change the name of that particular file that is version 1 add new features that is version 2 again add new features that is version 3 in this way so mention proper naming convention to each and every files and the folders now the second step is version control process or baseline see scm process handle different versions of configuration objects and the particular product see here in this diagram suppose developer 1 work on whatsapp v11 file that is first version of file now developer to add some extra features in particular product now they mention a file name whatsapp v12 means second version similarly developer 2 developer 3 edit that particular file also add some extra feature in that file now developer 3 give the file name whatsapp v13 miss third version of that file now this last updated file stored into this repository and multiple stakeholders use this latest or updated version of file so this process are handled by the configuration manager in scm process they control the alter modification and storing all this latest version file into the repository now the next step is change control process see there are various changes that occur at each phase of sdlc the changes related to the add or edit various configuration item changes related to the user permission or sometimes changes related to the clients requirements right now when there are changes are available so what is the process see here suppose customer want video call this new feature in particular project right so this changes is there now software team said this particular changes to the software configuration manager now software configuration manager check that overall impact of that particular change in your project after that they approve those changes or denied those changes if particular changes affect on your project or there is a wrong impact on your project so configuration manager denied doe changes okay otherwise they approve it if configuration manager approve those changes so implement all the necessary changes by the software developer and mention all these changes into the document so this is called as change control process so basically all the changes are approved by the software configuration manager now the next step is configuration audit process so basically configuration manager here identify that all the changes are properly developed or not they check that or they audit that all the completeness correctness and consistency of modified or changeable items in software configuration process they also mentioned that what is new in each version and why the changes are necessary they audit and verify all this complete process and maintain a document accordingly now the last step is review and status reporting process basically configuration manager takes some technical review of each and every module in particular project they take a review on application workflow miss complete workflow of your process from start to end various process and models configuration items means related to software and hardware resources are properly used or not and all the changing requests of the client they take a review of this thing and mention all these details in documents now this status report provided to the developer tester end users customers and stakeholders they check that your complete project is developed as per the customer requirements they also mentioned some user manual installation process guide configuration guide and dos and donts guide see here suppose when you buy a washing machine so at that time there is a user manual is there this user manual mention everything how to install washing machine then how to use washing machine dos and donts related to the washing machine right so this is called as review and status report this is developed by the configuration manager this is the last step of scm process now the next topic is scm repository basically scm repository is a set of all control process and data structure which allows software team to manage all the changes in effective manner see here in this particular diagram this is a scm repository there are total six tools are used like versioning dependency tracking change management requirement tracing configuration management and audit trails these are the six tools are used in scm repository they manage version control change control and release control process now these are the different functions of scm repository now lets discuss these functions and tools in detail now why scm repository is used in particular scm process basically scm repository is centralized database all the changes are performed and after that store this changes or updated version file into the scm repository okay the first function is data sharing means this sem repository ensure that all this information are consistently and accurately shared with all the stakeholders then information sharing multiple user access latest version of file from this repository then tool integration here scm repository use different tools for version control change control purpose data integration here one or more resources miss different software resources hardware resources then different programming languages database framework so integration of all those things while developing a particular product is necessary so they maintain this thing next one is a methodology and foreign enforcement here they define entity relationship model means while developing a particular project there are different modules are there right and now there is a inter relationship between each and every model and also there is some authorization process lets take an example of college management system there are suppose three modules student teacher and hod module so this all three modules are interrelated with each other student model used by the user student teacher model used by the teacher hod model used by the hod also right so this is called as entity relationship model means which type of modules are there what is their functionality and used by the which stakeholders this is called as methodology enforcement the next one is the document standardization means everything have mentioned in document in particular standard approach so this is a scm repository function now the next is scm repository tools the first tool is versioning see as we discussed earlier there are various versions of particular product and particular project so this versioning tool mention all the version numbers of particular file as per their creation date next one is the dependency tracking and change management see as per the customer requirement there are various changes are occur in particular project so they manage and track all the changes in relationship between all the objects and their models for that purpose they use uml diagram next one is a requirement tracing see there are two types of tracing first is a forward tracing and second one is a backward tracing forward tracing means first design a particular product then develop a particular product and after that deliver to the customer and take a feedback from the customer this is called as forward tracing now backward tracing means after developing a particular product check that which is developed as per the customer requirements or not this is called as backward tracing next one is a configuration management so here this repository tool track a complete series of configuration means they maintain all the version of particular product every version there are new features and new specifications are there then audit trails so audit trails establish all the information of when why and why whom all these changes are occur they mention all these details in particular database now as per your exam point of view these questions are important first which are the layers of scm process explain each in detail here you have to explain scm process for 8 marks then what is scm explain change control mechanism for 7 marks then what is software scm repository explain their features of tool set for 8 marks and explain scm repository features for 7 marks so you have to prepare this topic completely for 7 to 8 marks so thank you keep learning
