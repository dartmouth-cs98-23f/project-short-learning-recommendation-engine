suddenly hear your stomach begin to grumble you decide to head to a fast food joint  where you order a hot dog and a hamburger   theyre put in similar boxes and  handed to you through the window you have no way of knowing which box has  the hot dog and which has the burger obviously once you open one  of the boxes and see a burger   you will immediately know that  the other one has the hot dog this means that the hot dog and the  burger and entangled in a certain way this is roughly the idea upon which  quantum entanglement is based follows the rules of classical mechanics  this is a study of the motion of bodies in   accordance with the general principles  first laid down by sir isaac newton but what about objects that  are really really small   do they also follow these same  laws of classical mechanics believe it or not the answer is no when things get that small  quantum mechanics takes over   and things start to get extremely weird quantum mechanics is the language of tiny  particles like photons—the particles that   make up light—and particles inside an atom such  as protons neutrons and electrons to give you   a rough idea as to the size of these particles  consider this—the tip of a needle is so large   that it could fit billions of electrons thats  how incredibly small electrons truly are now that you have a general idea of the  size of electrons let’s talk about identities if someone were to ask “who are you” what  would you say probably your name right now let’s assume that an anthropomorphic raccoon   from another planet asks you the same  question what would you say then perhaps“i am peter quill a human from earth” in this case you specified  3 levels of identification similarly in a 3d space xy and z coordinates  are used to specify an object’s exact location   as no two objects can have the  same xy and z coordinates   if you consider a 4dimensional space—with time   t as an additional dimension—then no two  particles can have the same 4 coordinates in the same way an electron has 4 levels of  identification consisting of 4 quantum numbers   every electron within an atom has  a unique set of quantum numbers   no two electrons can share the same  combination of 4 quantum numbers electrons can be identified using these  4 quantum numbers which are called principal quantum number orbital angular momentum quantum number  magnetic quantum number electron spin quantum number all of these quantum numbers are very  important as they help determine the   electron configuration of an atom and the  probable location of electrons within the atom however for the scope of this video   we’re only going to talk about  the electron spin quantum number the definition of spin is—the intrinsic value of  the angular momentum of a fundamental particle an   electron can either have a positive spin called  ‘spin up’ or a downward spin called ‘spin down’ now this is where things get bizarre when we say an electron has a  positive spin or a negative spin   it doesn’t mean that the electron is actually  spinning although it does have angular momentum   and proper magnetic orientation it’s not  exactly “spinning” it may actually exist   in a state of superposition—when it  has both a negative and positive spin you may find the idea of superposition confusing   because this doesn’t seem to go along  with our perception of the real world to help explain this a bit better here’s a  famous example for understanding superposition you might have heard of schrödingers cat   it is a famous thought experiment devised by  austrianirish physicist erwin schrödinger it goes like this… imagine you put a cat inside  an opaque soundproof box along with a radioactive   substance a vial of poison and a geiger  counter if the radioactive substance decays   then the geiger counter triggers a setup that  releases the poison killing the cat but the   decay of the substance is a random process so  there’s no way to predict when it will happen and that is why before opening the box   you can say that the cat is in a superposition  of being both alive and dead at the same time in the same way when a coin  spins on a flat surface   it’s in a state of superposition  between its two faces—head and tails similarly electrons in their natural state  exist as a superposition of both up and down   spin only when measured do they give a definite  value of up or down which in technical terms   is referred to as the “collapse of the  wavefunction” in quantum mechanics wave function   collapse occurs when a wave function which was  initially in a superposition of a few states   reduces to a single state due to  interaction with the external world when a pair of electrons are generated interact  or share spatial proximity their spin states   can get entangled which is what scientists  call the quantum entanglement of electrons once the electrons are entangled the two  electrons can only have opposite spins   that is if one is measured to have “up spin”  the second immediately becomes down spin now we know that the two electrons  unmeasured do not have a single spin   but a superposition of both up and down spin  if we were to separate the two electrons   arbitrarily far say we put one in a physics  lab on earth and another in a different lab   somewhere in the andromeda galaxy and we  measure the spin of the electron on earth   we will immediately know the measurement  of the one in the andromeda galaxy for example if we measure the  earth electron to have up spin   we immediately know that the  other electron has down spin   this information traveled instantaneously  and faster than the speed of light as one can imagine this idea greatly  bothered famous physicist albert einstein it was such a disturbing realization  in fact that he called this phenomenon   “spooky action at a distance” so how can this  ‘spooky action at a distance’ be useful to us well lets start with one of the most  common everyday objects—the clock having a common synchronized clock  is very important in todays world   they keep things like stock markets  and gps systems in line today   we have extremely precise clocks known  as atomic clocks the quantumlogic clock   at the us national institute of standards and  technology nist in colorado will neither lose   nor gain one second in some 15 billion years  which is roughly the age of the universe entangled atomic systems would not be preoccupied  with local differences and would instead solely   measure the passage of time effectively bringing  them together as a single pendulum that means   adding 100 times more atoms into an entangled  clock would make it 100 times more precise entangled clocks could even be linked to form  a worldwide network that would measure time   independent of location vastly expanding the  technology of gps systems and telecommunication then of course there’s quantum cryptography as a kid have you ever made up a secret  code language that only you and your best   friend could understand imagine that but  with the key to cracking the code being   randomly polarized photons entangled with  each other that is quantum cryptography today some tech companies use  qkd quantum key distribution   to design ultrasecure networks in  2007 switzerland tried out an id  quantique product to provide a tamperproof  voting system during an election this system promises to be highly secure  because if the photons are entangled   any changes to their quantum  states made by intruders would   be immediately apparent to  anyone monitoring the system researchers at japan’s hokkaido university  developed the world’s first entanglementenhanced   microscope using a technique known as differential  interference contrast microscopy using entangled   photons greatly increases the amount of  information the microscope can gather   as measuring one entangled photon  gives information about its partner how about quantum teleportation… is it possible yes teleportation is possible in the world  of subatomic particles but it’s entirely   different from the way teleportation is  depicted in movies and popular culture   quantum teleportation involves the transportation  of information rather than the transportation of   matter which is the type of teleportation  typically focused on in science fiction physicists continue to delve  into and understand more about   the capabilities of quantum entanglement  once we are able to harness this knowledge   it could potentially revolutionize  every aspect of our existence until then we will continue to try and make sense  of the principles of quantum mechanics because   let’s face it it’s a strange  branch of science that doesn’t   seem to make any sense in the real world basically as nobel laureate  richard feynman once said   “if you think you understand quantum mechanics  you don’t understand quantum mechanics”
