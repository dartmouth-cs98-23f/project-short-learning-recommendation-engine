need but physics might music classical cryptography that encrypts messages with mathematical equations is secure enough for classical computing but with the emergence of quantum computing it may not be enough protection thats where quantum cryptography comes in it uses physics instead of math here well talk about why quantum cartography is so secure but despite the advantages there are still limits and challenges to quantum cryptography and quantum key distribution read about how one company is tackling the quantum security front in the link above or description below quantum cryptography uses particles of light or photons to transmit cryptographic keys over fiber optic wire the photons represent binary bits aka zeros and ones its a completely secure system because of these properties of quantum mechanics particles can exist in more than one place or state at a time a quantum property cannot be observed without changing or disturbing it and whole particles cannot be copied quantum cryptography follows a model developed in 1984 that goes like this alice wishes to send bob a message alice initiates the message sending bob a key or stream of photons but the photons first pass through a polarizer polarizing each photon in a certain state horizontal vertical diagonal to the right or diagonal to the left as bob receives the photons he doesnt know the correct polarization so he randomly uses one of two beam splitters to read each photons polarization and decipher the key alice and bob can then compare the splitter they used the photons read with the wrong splitter are discarded and the remaining sequence is the key if there is an eavesdropper present who has the same tools as bob they would not only have the disadvantage of not being able to compare their results with alice but they would also change the photon positions that alice and bob expect to see so they would blow their cover its impossible to measure the quantum state of a system without disturbing it in theory qkd is unhackable after keys are exchanged between the involved parties there is little concern that a malicious actor could decode the data without the key what do you think is quantum cryptography the answer to the quantum computing threat share your thoughts in the comments and be sure to hit that like button you
