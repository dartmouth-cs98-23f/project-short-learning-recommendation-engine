daniel smilkov hi im daniel martin wattenberg hi im martin fernanda viegas hi im fernanda machine learning is pretty complex so weve been experimenting with ways to visualize whats happening theres a core concept in machine learning called highdimensional space heres one way to wrap your head around this concept you can think about people as being highdimensional for example take famous scientists you can think about when they were born where they were born their fields of study each of these is like a dimension of that person these dimensions become difficult to untangle when you think about different people because someone might be similar in some ways but very different in others martin wattenberg but this is the kind of thing you can use machine learning for with machine learning the computer isnt told the meaning of these dimensions it just sees them as numbers and it sees each set of numbers as a data point but by looking across all of these dimensions at once its able to place related points closer together in highdimensional space daniel smilkov heres a concrete example where words are treated as highdimensional data points the important thing to remember is that we havent told the computer the meaning of words instead weve shown it millions of sentences as examples of how words get used here is a visualization of the results were looking at a subset of words that the computer has learned about each dot represents one word each word is a data point with 200 dimensions using a technique called tsne the computer clusters words together that it considers related and clusters formbase the meaning even though weve never taught it the meaning of words here is a cluster of numbers months of the year words related to space peoples names cities and so on fernanda viegas we can also look closely at smaller sets of words if we search piano we can run tsne only on words related to piano we get clusters of composers genres musical instruments and more martin wattenberg and this approach doesnt just work from words for example you can also treat an image as a highdimensional data point heres a dataset where lots of people wrote digits between 0 and 9 people write in all kinds of ways so the question is instead of us needing to manually code rules for all the ways people write could a machine figure it out itself using machine learning each image is 784 pixels the computer treats each pixel as a dimension again using tsne it clusters these images in a highdimensional space weve colorcoded them so that its easier for us to see whats going on and you can see groups of digits clustering together its learned something about the meaning of these digits fernanda viegas these visualizations techniques weve been exploring can be useful for all kinds of things thats why were working on open sourcing all of this as part of tensorflow so that anyone can use these tools to explore their data music playing
