be midway through midway ill be talking about pragmatic algorithm game algorithmic game theory which is a talk i gave at the acmec conference i adapted a little bit for you guys but uh just a bit so so let me start by saying what what algorithmic game theory means particularly to that community um so there was this famous book uh this edited book called algorithmic game theory that ended up uh being sort of an early point around which this field gelled and it described itself as being research it described this topic of algorithmic game theory as being about research at the interface of computer science game theory and economic theory largely motivated by the internet so if you look at the kind of work that that was proposed not just in that book but in work that has called itself algorithmic gain theory afterwards um it seems that this community is particularly interested in the design of new mechanisms particularly but not only auctions and market mechanisms trying to analyze existing mechanisms and figure out something about what they do particularly prominent example is sponsored search where the mechanism kind of predates a formalized design approach but then theres a question about what what happens in it and equilibrium computation which of course is a kind of of both a very fundamental computational problem and a kind of bedrock tool that you would want to use in a lot of this kind of analysis so typically this community has gone for very general settings and attacked them theoretically as indeed were all kind of familiar both in economics and computer science um and uh i think theyve added a lot over the traditional economic kinds of analysis um yielding um both impossibility and optimality results which maybe arent that uh different from what economists would expect to see the same kinds of things economists have proven for years but added to that kind of um repertoire also that the perspective of approximation and uh i i think really kind of move the ball down the field a bit from the perspective of approximation showing you know for example that they can achieve something close to optimal revenue with a simple mechanism or something like that and so so broadly speaking this is what i mean when i say algorithm and game theory this kind of field um mostly within cs but but very much in communication with economics um unfortunately i think this field struggles uh of course as any theoretical discipline does um with obtaining um the same kinds of clean theoretical results that address a complex and realistic problems so there tends to be this sort of boundary of analytic tractability beyond which its its hard to go and this approximation framework makes it possible maybe to go further than one might expect but but nevertheless there there sometimes is this experience of hitting a wall and going to uh to something more pregnant more practical so the perspective that im going to advocate today is what im calling a pragmatic approach to algorithmic game theory and what i want to argue uh you know what i did argue to that community what im what i want to argue to those of you here who see yourself as part of that community is that its possible to get more traction on realistic problems that one should be interested in by leveraging 100 or both of two kinds of pragmatism and the first is to care about getting good performance only on problems of interest rather than in relatively unconstrained settings so to try to drill into much narrower and but nevertheless useful categories of problems and the second is to achieve success in statistical rather than analytical terms and so so this means to to adopt a kind of datadriven approach in ones work where the problems of interest might be defined implicitly by a data set that that gives examples of the kinds of problems one cares about and or there may be datadriven measures of performance so we might be scored on some kind of average measure of performance over a data set rather than simply approving a theorem that says something about how close to optimality weve come um so all of this you can sort of see as a sort of machine learning perspective about how to do um work at the boundary of economics and community and computer science so um in this talk im going to talk about work that ive done with collaborators that attacks problems that are kind of core algorithmic game theory problems um in the sense that theyre the same problems that the algorithmic game theory community has been itself interested in a more theoretical vein but but thats pragmatic in both of these ways and before launching in let me just say the obvious that i i certainly dont mean to give the impression that ive invented the notion of being pragmatic about algorithmic game theory there are many others uh in in this computer science economics community who do the same and indeed i think one reason that im really happy to be at this workshop is i think that most of you here seem to have this kind of sensibility about the work that you do so i hope that makes you a receptive audience and probably the only way i could really piss you off and lose you would be if i gave you the impression that i was the only one doing this so let me let me reassure you that thats not what i think um so so in particular im going to talk about three different lines of work uh you can see them up at the top if you have good eyes um the the first one ill talk about is repurposing uh radio spectrum via whats called an incentive auction uh which is something the fcc is in the progress of doing as they do these kind of slides along the way im just going to kind of call out my collaborators so my phd student alexandra frechette is my main collaborator here and frank hunter holder whos lingshu and steve ramage contributed in to some of the tools that i used in this work so you guys have probably heard about the incentive auction but let me just say just a little bit about it so the fcc had this great idea of having an auction that had something to do with incentives well no thats not quite it um but but the fcc um yeah what a great name right i dont know but uh but but anyway thats what they call it so what can i do about that um the fc the fcc wants to basically sell off radio spectrum to uh mobile phone companies as they do um the problem that they face is that theyve kind of already sold all of it there just isnt really good radio spectrum to sell anymore and people still want to watch cat videos on their phones while theyre on the subway so so weve got a problem and the solution to this problem um is to take radio spectrum thats being used for something else and repurpose it for use uh in uh in mobile phones because thats the use that people now care about and in particular it turns out that television you know back in the day when when broadcast television started up it got given really awesome radio spectrum because that it was kind of the the big game in town and now broadcast television is not that important to people people are much more interested in in getting television over cable or satellite or you know even over the internet so so it seems like maybe theres theres some economic efficiency gains to be had here by by taking back some of that spectrum and and selling it off to uh to mobile phone companies where it can be used more productively of course the catch here is its not im not a lawyer im i dont fully understand the legal side of these things about whether this is necessary or just a good idea but its at the very least a good idea not to just confiscate this spectrum from the the television stations and and give it back to to the mobile phone companies in order to make this all go down in a sensible way uh it turns out that what one needs to do is to buy the the radio spectrum back from the television stations uh in order to be able to then sell it off to the mobile phone companies so this gives rise to the question of how you would go about doing that how are you going to buy back um the the right to broadcast from a whole bunch of different television stations all of which operate you know at particular powers on particular channel bills in particular from particular antennas in given regions of the country in this crazy patchwork all over the united states and you know one by one get different ones of them to sell back their their right to broadcast and somehow assemble this into something that that a mobile phone company would be interested in buying so so thats the the kind of underlying optimization problem that that is going to form the allocation problem for for this incentive option so um so i can tell you this this auction is now approved and ready to go you can see this is the report and order that the federal communications commission um just put out uh announcing that this was going to happen and giving some details about how its going to happen uh you can see it was just a little over a month ago that this happened so this is a really current thing uh the the reported order makes really entertaining reading i recommend that you sit down with it its uh 488 pages long and its written almost entirely by lawyers so um so i think its great i mean you know you here at a business school presumably do this kind of thing all the time so you know that should be fun for you um but uh you know in case youre not going to read it let me just tell you a little bit about what it would say uh yeah i can sort of put in one slide with the 488 pages safe from your point of view as economists um essentially there are going to be two different auctions that will happen in a linked way so therell be a reverse um or descending price auction for broadcasters and in the reverse auction essentially whats going to happen is stations will be offered some very high reserve price to stop being television stations and instead to be people with bags of money and theyll theyll say yes i would take your large bag of money in exchange for not being a television station anymore and the fcc will look at all of these offers to stop broadcasting and and determine that it would be possible to get rid of a whole bunch of spectrum if that were true it would be possible to take all of the tv stations that go up to channel 52 and change that to tv stations that only go up to channel 30 and then they could take that radio spectrum that was used for channels 31 up to 52 except for channel 37 if youre one of the people who understands how these things work um turns out theres something special going on there radio telescopes need to operate on channel 37 um and uh and you take that big block and then you can sell that off to the cell phone companies because what cell phones need is a big contiguous block of spectrum they they cant operate on little corners of spectrum in different geographical regions so so then you do that but then youve probably gotten too many people who are willing to accept big amounts of money so then you start lowering the amount of money that youre offering everybody and as the this amount of money that youre offering goes down at some point high value participants might say im not so happy anymore to accept your reduced amount of money i would rather go back to being a television station and they they would go back on the air youd youd confirm that its still possible to put them somewhere and uh and you kind of keep doing this until everybody uh you know either is is being paid nothing or is indispensable to you and cant be put back on the air ill show you that uh schematically in a minute you know why why do you have to go through the government to make this happen um the real reason is um lets say im a television station um in lets say right now im channel 13 so or lets make me a uhf station and sam channel 15 um you know thats not a piece of spectrum thats going to get given to the radio uh to the uh the telecoms but instead what could happen is um you could take this and take somebody else who is in a useful piece of spectrum and kind of stick him into my spot on this ability to move around stations uh is something that only the government can do and fundamentally thats needed to get big contiguous blocks of usable spectrum so so the government is telling the top the tv stations you know this is a onetime chance for you to participate in this auction and i think thats a pretty plausible thing to say because this repacking is uh you know it really has to happen on a national scale to be useful um and you know the government only can do this you know theyre going to cause slightly different interference on the stations that get repacked they can only do this because theyve been given authority by a law so this cant really happen just just on the side um so this is the reverse auction the forward auction is then taking this stuff and selling it off to the um to the cell phone companies so so here were going to have different licenses uh in every region and the prices for these licenses are going to increase until um uh supply and demand meet so youre going to have just a much more straightforward kind of ascending auction this is not absolutely trivial but this is kind of the sort of thing that the fcc has been doing for a long time um all right so so we have this reverse auction we have a forward auction and then we have we have some kind of link between them uh so we have we have some amount of revenue that we need to achieve to to make everybody happy about what what just happened and if that hasnt happened then basically we um we decided that we were trying to clear too much spectrum and so then we we reduce the amount of spectrum that were trying to clear and that will have the effect of both lowering the prices that we have to pay because we have to buy out fewer tvs stations and increasing the the per unit prices that we will end up charging telecoms because the supply will have gotten scarcer and so the prices will continue to rise and so so essentially what well do is well well just change the amount of spectrum that we have to clear and then keep running the auction you might notice that these two prices are not directly related to each other right so so this is not a doublesided market um or if its a doublesided market its very indirectly a doublesided market because kind of whats happening is the government is you know doing this one auction with everybody and getting all these goods and then kind of glomming them together and turning them into something else and selling them to somebody else so the government gets to keep whatever the difference is and they the congressional budget office has projected that that difference is 25 billion dollars so so the governments take is is a bunch of money so let me tell you a little bit more about the reverse auction which is going to be my focus i found in talking to people that there seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about how this auction works and so um maybe you guys all understand it but i made a very sophisticated powerpoint animation to explain how this works and and i say this both jokingly and not um i say it jokingly in the sense that when you see it youre going to be disappointed but but i say it seriously in the sense that it took me forever to make this so lets see um so so it turns out that rather than talking about uh buying our television stations which turns out for various reasons to be a little hard to think about um abstractly im going to switch to a problem that i think you have more experience with which is the problem of uh airline over booking right so so you go to the uh your airline of choice and they say you know sorry remember that ticket we sold you for the flight that youre on well it doesnt really correspond to a seat on our plane um in fact you know it turns out theres this law that for some reason we can sell you things that dont exist and if you dont show up for the flight that we keep your money but if we dont have a seat for you thats just too bad for you and now were gonna see what happens so so lets think about the part of what happens and and in fact what really happens is they just screw you in your strand in chicago but lets imagine something slightly more reasonable that involves an auction so so the way this is going to work is uh and and for reasons that have to do with this fcc action im im going to ask that passengers either fly in the cabin theyre assigned to or they have to give up their seat im not going to allow passengers in first class to move to economy class ill explain afterwards why thats important so the feasibility constraint that im going to have as an airline is that the number of passengers in each cabin is less than or equal to the number of seats i have because i cant fly with people standing up um someday theyll do that but not yet um and ill use a descending clock auction to set compensations and the way to think about this is i start with a plan thats big enough to hold everybody so so these dots which i individually placed with my mouse are the people and this is my plan right so this by analogy is the current state of affairs with with television stations theyre all kind of all the television stations have somewhere to broadcast the problem is were going to get rid of a bunch of the spots right were gonna this is clearing a bunch of spectrum were going to lose a bunch of the seats and now we have people without seats um and and this is where the airline decides hey we could send a smaller plan and save ourselves some money so uh the airline offers compensation so we say to everybody well give you a thousand dollars if um uh if you just elect not to fly and well well fly you tomorrow morning and everybody gets to make a choice about whether that sounds good to them or not and so some people say no im going to hold on to my seat im not going to take your thousand dollars and theyre theyre on the plane and some people say a thousand dollars would be great why not ill do it and and they kind of go off to the side here and and so heres our state of affairs with a thousand dollars the thing to notice now is that ive got a lot of empty seats so as an airline i think hmm these guys you know dont dont seem to value money all that highly i made a bit of a mistake offering them a thousand dollars so let me let me change my offer so you say to everybody remember what that thing i said about a thousand dollars really i was lying its only eight hundred dollars how do you feel about that and uh and some of them say well you know turns out i only did it because you said a thousand dollars in fact i want to go back on your stupid plane and uh and so now some of them move back and and in fact in first class um lets say they all move back so so whats going to happen in this auction then is these guys now these blue dots have nowhere they can go on the plane because im not going to let them go to a different class and so that means theyve accepted an offer for eight hundred dollars but i cant make them any subsequent offers because i cant back that offer up with anything if i was to offer them 700 and they said i wont take your offer i would be in the embarrassing situation of not being able to do anything so so i have to freeze them at the last offer they accepted these other guys though i can still do without so for them i lowered the price and then some of them move back and then i lower the price again and then some of them move back and until something freezes again and now the green guys are frozen because again there are no spots for them so i freeze them at a different price the blue guys are just gluttons for punishment thats why theyre flying an economy class so we just keep on hitting them with lower and lower prices and some of them move back like the suckers they are theyll even take 300 and eventually two hundred dollars a couple of them move back and these guys get frozen and so so this is how the auction works so basically were going to keep on lowering prices on people as long as its possible to accommodate them back where they were before and then basically the the willingness of other people to eventually um participate in the auction or quit is whats going to drive the prices for you okay so so what does this correspond to in reality you might think this corresponds to sort of good spectrum and medium spectrum and bad spectrum but thats thats really not true what i want this instead to correspond to is different places so theres nothing special about first class you know it might have been the first class got a worse price than business glass whats really special is that you can only go back to the place that you originally were and and that theyre just different constraints in different places so lets say first class was really new york economy class sorry guys its the midwest um and uh and so we just had different feasibility constraints in different places right so so it might be that new york kind of walks up early because there are a lot of constraints in the new york region where prices are just falling and falling in chicago because you have lots of open space out here um now now heres the the thing about the real problem the feasibility constraints in fact are a crazy jumbled mess right so so this is a picture of the feasibility constraints it might be a picture made by nick actually im not sure did you make this picture thanks for the picture nick i never thanked you properly i want to take this opportunity um so yeah okay that that was special okay so so this is uh this is a visualization of the real constraint graph and and what you can see from this is just kind of that it sucks right theres just lots of lines everywhere um but but in particular what you can sort of imagine from this picture is you know every dot is a station right and a line is these two stations somehow constrain each other on what what channels theyre allowed to be on um and and because theres just not a lot of nice kind of symmetric cliques in this graph everything has just got weird stuff hanging off the side and that means that it then my nice story about kind of everyone in economy class is the same and everyone in business class is the same is not going to be true in this graph the question of whether you can personally go back is going to be a a personalized choice for everybody the point means there exists a constraint between those two stations that either they cant be on the same channel they cant be on adjacent channels they cant be on certain same or adjacent channels but theyre allowed to be on other ones or some combination of those sorts of constraints um and and there are many channels so so you know typically were not going to clear all the spectrum so is there any two channels linked by an edge can still both be accommodated but you know eventually theyre going to start to constrain each other as i reduce the set of available channels so so heres another visualization of this graph which uh is maybe a little bit easier to think about because this one has the advantage that it looks like the united states but the disadvantage that you cant see just how awful the new york region really is um its really awful it has some nodes with degrees above 200 so so theres some really really densely connected parts of this graph um this just sort of blows it out in a way that gives you a better sense of the connectivity of the graph um so so theres this underlying computational problem if i want to do this kind of airline algorithm the way i showed it to you this descending clock auction which is asking for a given set of people that i think are going to participate in the auction that have currently accepted going off air and another set of people that i have to repack because theyve exited the auction or they never participated is it possible for me to also not take you for every given person is it possible for me to put you back on the air and somehow readjust the stations i give to everybody so the the whole thing works and if so i get to lower your price and if not then youre frozen and i have to take the last price you accepted in a sense youre not participating in the auction anymore and and so this is this computational problem that im going to have to answer every time i want to consider lowering a price for every single station so im going to have to do this you know kind of on the order of 2000 times every time i take the clock and uh you know bad news this is the part where computer scientists come and bum you out because uh this is an np complete problem um which the theorists will tell you means that you should go shoot yourself in the corner because nothing can be dealt with chicago somebody can shoot you for you you dont have to do it yourself um but you should be very sad uh the pragmatic truth is just because the problem is np complete doesnt mean you can never solve it it just means you cant be confident that you can always solve it so so it turns out there are a whole kind of research communities within cs about finding practical ways of solving np complete problems and they work all the time you know google wouldnt be making a selfdriving car if it werent possible to solve np complete problems with decent reliability all the time um you just cant do it absolutely all the time thats why the car will sometimes crash sorry or something um so uh so so here weve got a graph graph coloring problem with 130 000 um pairwise relationships between stations something on the order of a couple of million uh actual constraints which uh speak about individual channels um and the fcc was initially pretty skeptical about whether this problem could be solved at a national scale and they were doing a bunch of pretty hacky things to try to make the problem smaller um in the end uh were solving this problem um exactly and at a national scale using some tools from empirical algorithmic so ill tell you a little bit about how were doing that basically the the bunch of tricks that weve got are to use a satin coding automatic algorithm configuration and algorithm portfolio so ill tell you kind of a slide about what each of those things is so okay um so so what do we do with this thing um well how many of you know what propositional satisfiability is hooray for you okay you guys can get a coffee i mean they spend like 30 seconds telling the rest of you what propositional satisfiability is this is this is one of the awesome problems in computer science right this is uh this is part of the bread and butter of computer science this is like the you know corno whatever it is chrono something something what is that what is it is it its like chrono competition or something yeah thats why im a computer scientist anyway um so yeah please edit that part out of the video we dont know about going on milton friedman would be so unimpressed with me um okay so so basically satisfiability is what is actually the first problem that was shown to be np completers and the the first little kind of set of problems and uh its really easy to think about because its so simple and that means that there are some really powerful algorithms that work with it because the the problem itself is so simple that you can really wrestle with it in great detail so its sort of a pure combinatorial problem it says ive got a set of variables and each variable can be true or false then i can make literals which are the variables that either the variables themselves or the negations of the variables i can make clauses which are disjunctions of literals so a clause is something like a or b or not c right so its its a disjunction of either variables or negated variables and then i make a formula which is a conjunction of clauses so i end up with something that looks like a or b or not c and d or e or not a so i make this whole string of propositional variables connected with answers or knots in this particular way and the question that i then ask is is there some way of assigning values to each variable from true or false that make this whole logic formula evaluate to true and you know your first impulse might be well sure that sounds really easy you know i just i can just come up with true and false values and then i i know i know all about logic right i know how to evaluate this thing and figure out whether its true or false and indeed its very easy to to come up with some assignment of uh true and false values to all the variables look at it in the formula figure out if its true or false but then you might notice well if ive got n variables there are two to the n assignments of of truth values to those variables and i could try each of them and test it but is there some more principled way of figuring out which of those two to the end things i have to try or do i have to do all of them well if you can answer that question then theres a million dollars waiting for you at the clay mathematics institute because that would involve answering the question of whether p is equal to np and so we dont know but so far we havent found a way so so far more or less you have to try everything so this is sort of the combinatory the the combination lock of combinatorial problems you just sort of have to to grind through everything or sort of in the worst case it seems like you have to but in practice maybe theres a lot of structure in your problem right if i gave you something like um a or not a and all kinds of other stuff maybe you could look at that and say well thats got a contradiction in it that first clause simply cant be satisfied so i dont need to grind through all the other stuff i can just spot that contradiction thats a very simple example of the fact that you dont always have to grind through everything and and there are much richer reasons why you might not have to grind through everything so that thats this kind of empirical algorithms framework you cant do it for for the worst case input but you can do it for everything else so how do we formulate this ftc problem as a sad problem um ill just do this kind of at a high level but basically we say every station has to broadcast on one of its allowable channels that gives me a constraint that looks like this um so so one of these at least one of these variables has to be set to true the variable which says this day broadcast on this channel um so the disjunction of all these variables has to be true which means at least one of them has to be true each station only gets to broadcast on one channel um that means and the negation of each pair of values that station could take uh disjoint so so at least one of them has to be false at least one of every pair has to be false so far those two things just say every station gets one channel that doesnt seem like ive done something very complicated yet um but the interference thing is the hard part so then i take all of these pairwise interference constraints and i i throw them all in so i say you cant be on channel 17 while im on channel 18 and i do that two and a half million times for all of the pairwise interference constraints and i just throw them all in there too and then i give this thing to a sat solver with it all of its glory of tens of thousands of variables and two and a half million constraints and it turns out as a side note that most of the clauses have only two variables in them youll notice only this first kind of clause that i gave at the top has more than two variables in them and thats a really powerful thing for a sat solver because when one of the variable when one of the literals gets set to false i can infer that the second one has to get set to true or the whole things not going to work and thats thats how i can see the contradiction doesnt work because if one of them gets said to false the other one uh actually the contribution does work doesnt it never mind anyway um other things dont work um yeah maybe i dont have a one variable example but uh but anyway when one of these things gets set to false the other one has to be true and then i know how this thing gets set and it might appear in other formulas and so then i can plug in its values in those other formulas and that can cause other things to get forced and i can get these chains in something thats called unit propagation where i go grinding through without having to do search setting all kinds of variables and thats kind of a powerful thing so so basically we get this crazy thing you might think on the face of it its so ridiculously big right ive got like tens of thousands of variables and in the worst case i think this thing is exponential in the number of variables so how could this possibly work um the trick were going to use is something that my research group has been working on pretty hard for about a decade which is called algorithm configuration and the idea is that um it it turns out the heuristic algorithms which is what were talking about here algorithms that that dont come with a worst case performance guarantee but that sort of embody things that seem like they should be good ideas which is what a heuristic is um tend to have a lot of parameters as youre building this kind of algorithm you tend to face a choice about you know how much preprocessing should i do should i branch this way or that way which variable should i consider first and the authors of these these algorithms can and typically do expose those choices to the end user as parameters so they can be changed at runtime so something that you might do if you know that you have a given distribution of problems that you need to attack is to set those parameters in a way that works particularly well for your problem so that you effectively custom design an algorithm that will work well just for you and so so that seems good except if youve got something like 100 parameters you know setting these things by hand by repeatedly running the algorithm and having it take many hours and then seeing how it did is a pretty hard thing to do so weve been working on what we call meta algorithms algorithms that take other algorithms as input run those other algorithms many times essentially do a statistical experiment design on these algorithms figure out kind of whats going on with them and uh and explore the space and eventually find some parameter configuration that works really well you might be skeptical that such a thing could be make made practical its its beyond the scope of this talk to say much about how that works so ill say one thing but suffice it to say that this really does work pretty well um so kind of intuitively how do we do it um let me give the example of a single parameter which is small enough that i can draw it on the board here so so lets say i have a parameter x which affects the performance of my algorithm and i have a parameter y that i want to minimize think of why as something like the log of runtime so im trying to make an algorithm that that whose runtime is minimized on the same instances so im running this over and over again on the same problems um so lets lets imagine that this red line in the graph here is the true performance of the algorithm as a function of x um and of course i dont know that if i knew that i would just minimize that but i dont get to ever observe that what i get to do is run the algorithm at particular points and observe its run time at that point so these blue circles are places where i actually observed the runtime of the algorithm um then what i do is i fit a a regression model to all of this i use a fancy kind of nonparametric regression in this case im using something called gaussian process regression the advantage of gaussian processes is they give me uncertainty estimates well theyre nonparametric so theyre arbitrarily wiggly which is important to me and they give me uncertainty estimates which are small at points that ive observed because i i know whats going on there and they get bigger as i get away from points that i observe so so these um these gray ellipses are the uncertainty estimates at every point and so what youll see is you know right at the blue points the uncertainty estimates are small and as they get away theyre big and then what i do is i try to find a point that looks like would be good to evaluate a point that i havent seen yet that looks like it might be better than anything that ive seen before and what would it take to maybe be better you want to both be pretty low on the line and also have pretty high uncertainty and so so that criterion is called expected improvement whats the whats the amount of improvement that i could gain conditional on being better than the point that ive got now um so the green line that im showing you is a scaled version of expected improvement on this line and you can see a good place to evaluate would be right here according to the line and because i have high uncertainty at that point because these two points are pretty far apart and also the line is pretty small so heres a point that kind of makes a good tradeoff between the height of the line and the amount of uncertainty so i would then do another experiment right there and i would learn that in fact its not as good as the as the point to its left but then i would update my uncertainty estimates that id have another point and then i would end up my second choice would be to go here which really is a minimum or close to a minimum and i learned something good and i kind of keep going so so thats how this sort of uh search guided by a learned model in real time kind of can work so so this is uh this thing we have called sequential model based algorithm configuration or smack thats how it works okay so so that thats thats the idea of algorithm configuration and then i have the idea of making an algorithm portfolio which essentially says different solvers have different areas of strength and weakness so why should i have to commit just like a financial portfolio why should i buy only one stock why should i have only one algorithm in my back pocket why not have access to many uncorrelated algorithms and thereby leverage the fact that that the men of the the average of mens is different than the the men of the average um so uh so basically we leveraged this idea too we built something called sadzilla which is a portfolio of sat solvers this is a pictorial representation of what it does um and uh its destroying tokyo in this picture and uh basically this has become just kind of a dominantly successful strategy in the sap community whatever that is um so so basically we took all of these things together and and we built a uh a sat solver for the fccs problem so so im going to kind of conclude here by showing you experimentally what did this do on the fccs problem and uh heres uh so i need to show you uh how this graph works so this is uh the run time so basically im given some some distribution of instances that that arose in simulations of the auction that really you know to our best knowledge reflect what might happen in the fccs auction and ive got um problems of up to 1133 stations um which means tens of thousands of variables in the statin coding on the full usa interference graph um so i take those problems and then i run various sat solvers on them so in the upper lefthand corner these are the names of different and sat solvers that i ran and im showing you a cumulative density function here which says the probability of the basically the fraction of instances that got solved within every amount of time so looking for example at this blue line which is a solver called clasp you know after uh 10 to the zero seconds after one second and it solved nothing after about two seconds it was starting to solve things after 10 seconds it solved a little bit more than 10 percent of the instances and and so on and then we ran it for five minutes we ran everything for five minutes so after five minutes we just stopped them because you know were not made of time here we have to stop it at some point and uh and you see that the best of the solvers got maybe 45 percent of the instances solved which is already kind of good i mean something i should point out is that if you dont solve something you can just call it impossible you can just freeze that station and that basically costs you money but but thats okay right theres nothing that goes wrong from an incentive point of view if somebody gets frozen early you just pay them too much and as a computer scientist theres something really beautiful about that because theres a tradeoff between how well you can solve the problem and how much you have to pay people so you can really go to the fcc and say if i can give you one percent you know better sat solving ability im going to save you 100 million dollars and you know normally in the sac community you dont get to say things like that so thats pretty cool normally you can say if i can you know do one percent better i can write a paper in the south community okay so so basically we added a specially configured version of clasp uh we built a specially configured version of clasp why do we pick class which looks like the worst thing here basically because it was designed by its authors to expose a lot of parameters so it was designed to work really well with this configuration kind of approach and so its really suited to this um and and we built something that worked dramatically better um so this is now solving about 75 percent of the instances within five minutes and so thats already looking pretty good we then um basically did both a bunch of engineering and added some kind of portfolio ideas to this and built something that we call sat fc which for feasibility checking which is this red line and this is the thing that that weve made available to the fcc um and and you can see this is stochastically dominating everything else by by pretty healthy down partly just by by dealing with very easy instances very quickly there are a lot of very easy instances um but were now solving um just about everything all but about two percent of the instances uh within an eight hour cutoff um and so so this already gives you some sense that theres theres only so much to be gained by parallelization here there are only 2 000 stations that need to be checked around um so what does this look like most of the problems were satisfiable the blue bars here are points where it was satisfiable the red bars are points where it was unsat the gray bars are points where we timed down and didnt know and you can see we timed out in about one percent of the instances um so this is the last slide that ill give you um so far ive talked about a situation where we have people either going off the air or staying on the air in practice those of you who are old enough to remember televisions as compared to computers and particularly televisions that you actually accessed on the air might be aware of the fact that theres something called uhf and vhf there are different kinds of television spectrum and you might remember that vhf is kind of bad relative to uhf right its sort of a grainier picture its not quite as good and so it is now we really have both of those kinds of spectrum uhf is the stuff that we actually want to sell to the telecoms thats more appropriate for them so one thing that we might be able to do is say um the uhf stations could instead of going off the air maybe we should pay them a lower amount to accept a lower quality good to accept vhf spectrum instead of uhf spectrum and uh and and then you know thats another way of freeing up uhf spectrum so maybe we should give them these multiple options this is tricky and you know then of course i can do cascading things like i can buy out a vhf station thereby making some vhf spectrum available and then i can get a uhf guy to move into that and if those two moves are cheaper than getting that one guy to go off air maybe thats a better thing to do so so we what we and in fact theres not just vhf but theres upper vhf and lower vhf which are themselves different so theres really three bands of spectrum to care about um so it the problem is doing a design on this kind of space involves multiminded bidders it involves bidders who have values for now multiple things rather than just going off air and and that makes the auction design much more complex because as all of us know here auction design for multiminded bidders is is much uh more difficult to think about than for singleminded bidders except in this kind of glorious point case of vcg so um so this has been an area of active study for the the groups working with the fcc right now there are a whole variety of different proposals on the table um i im happy to kind of talk to you about some of the ideas here ive in the end ended up proposing something which im kind of excited about but im out of time now so im not going to tell you now what that is um instead i will just conclude if my computer worked the way i thought it did ill just conclude here so uh so there we go so i guess ive told you about uh the way the fcc incentive action works if youre interested uh let me say sort of one sentence about what these other things are and im happy to talk with you about them on the coffee break um so one of them is this idea of what i call computational mechanism analysis which basically means using computers to analyze existing mechanisms by solving exactly for their equilibria on samples from evaluation distribution of interest so we can think about something like sponsored search auctions and ask um you know how efficient is some given mechanism or how much revenue would it give me on expectation given different settings of a reserve price parameter or something like that so thats what i call computational mechanism analysis it basically works on the fact that that theyre now as of maybe five years ago exists some really powerful techniques for finding the exact equilibria of compactly represented games so that might be a technology that would be interested think to some of you so i just want to throw that out there the last thing is about a kind of sabbatical project that i worked on in uganda for building a cell phone based mobile market for agricultural commodities allowing subsistence farmers to sell surplus produce to traders in the cities using a kind of craigslist that runs over sms which is effectively a kind of double auction so if youre curious about the application of economic theory to development problems im happy to talk about that too so thanks for your attention and lets all have lunch cheers
