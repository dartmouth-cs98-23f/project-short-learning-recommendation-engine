many years and now want to transition into data science you are not alone i get this question so many of the times and in this video i am going to provide you some useful and effective tips that can help you make a transition from testing to data science first of all this transition is certainly possible there are many who have made this transition and im going to share one story of bindiya rajendran who described the story on analytics vidhya platform and the link is in video description below so you can read through it but she made this transition after eight years of working as a software test engineer so lets uh go through some of the tips that can help you so the tip number one is first you need to figure out in which role you want to make the transition because when you talk about data science as a field there are various roles data analyst data engineer data scientist data analyst among all these is the most easiest one relatively relatively data analyst is easier than data engineer or data scientist so maybe you can start with data analyst if you are very good in math and statistics you can start with data science data scientist as your target or if you are very good in software engineering you can make a data engineer your ultimate career objective but all of these roles have some common things into it and i have a video which describes the difference between these three roles so you can watch it you will get a full understanding so the tip number one i would like to share is in your current job you are working as a software test engineer you dont want to leave your job all of a sudden so to prepare for data science migration you have to start using python to automate your daytoday boring tasks as a test engineer you might be doing manual testing or automated testing using tools such as selenium in day to day life you have so many manual tasks you know you might be getting some extra file doing some analysis or you might be performing same repetitive tasks these are very easy to automate in python python is a very very easy language to learn even a high school student can learn it easily i have a python programming tutorial playlist if you watch just first 10 or 15 videos you should be fine you can easily start working on it so learning python to automate the task is tip number one as a test engineer you are working on some three tier software application which will have some type of database in that database you can now perform some basic data analysis you can use python and pandas for doing that analysis or you can use any bi tools such as power bi or tableau so lets say i have an insurance data set or a sales data set you can perform basic analytics such as what was my sales how was my sales growth in last three months how does the sales look like based on different geographic regions if you dont know power bi i have done a very good project on power bi like a real life power bi project and that playlist is quite popular i have received comments from some of my subscribers saying that after doing that project they actually got a job as a data analyst so follow that project and try to apply on data analytics you know try to build dashboard like dashboarding is a very basic thing that you can do all you need is some kind of database wherever there is data there is data science so you can there is always a scope of building dashboards if you are working on a database as a test engineer now i know its not your part of your regular job so you have to spend extra effort on weekend during the night to build these analytics dashboards and then present it to relevant people in your company these people could be your business manager or your company will have a data science department try to build relationship with the people in data science department there will be data analysts data scientists you talk to them you say okay i have built this dashboard do you think its useful or you can say i want to learn data science do you have any tasks where i can help i will i want to help you so that i can learn and usually people are nice some people might say no but you will find one or two people who who would be willing to help so the key here is persistence if you get no dont get demotivated keep on trying and on job learning is often the best because you are building something tangible that can be useful in the company and the best advantage you can get out of it is you know inter company department transfer i have seen enough examples where within a company the person is working in a different role as a test engineer and they can transition to a data science department within the same company that transition is easier because you know interviews wont be that tough it wont be as tough as as if you are applying in a outside company so migrating to data science department within the same company is the best thing that can happen many times as a test engineer you are working on logs so you can do some log analytics using python pandas or some of the bi tools and you know build nice dashboards and present the findings to engineering team or your business manager or your test engineering manager now when you decide to transition sometimes people have this dilemma that hey i have worked as a test engineer for five years now if im migrated am i going to start from ground zero and the answer is no there are two important skills that you have built as a test engineer that will be extremely useful in your data science journey skill number one is your critical thinking ability as a test engineer you are finding bugs in your software youre thinking about diverse workflows in your software and trying to find bugs you know by doing critical thinking so if you realize or not over this period of time you have built solid critical thinking abilities that are very very important when you start working in data science industry another skills you have developed is domain knowledge lets say i worked as a test engineer in healthcare industry or retail industry i have gained lot of domain knowledge you know i know a lot of processes and the domain knowledge is extremely important when you go to data science industry its not all about learning machine learning or python pandas those are two skills but the core skills which is communication domain knowledge business understanding core skills are extremely important and you have those core skills so when you transition youre not starting from ground zero youre already halfway the other half way you need to cover by learning specific tools now im going to share certain common tips which are applicable doesnt matter if you are transitioning from test engineer or mechanical engineer etc while youre doing your nine to six job thinking about transitioning to data science the first thing you should do is start learning data science skills in parallel and this you can do by watching youtube videos such as my channel has a lot of youtube a lot of videos on data science a tool skill set you can also enroll into courses you know there are so many elearning platforms you can buy a course for like 10 and you can learn those skills there are many boot camps boot camps are basically two to three month fastpaced learning programs that you can join and learn those skills so learn those skills in your extra time on your weekend if you want to go to youtube search for code basics data analyst three months roadmap i have a complete roadmap where you can learn data analyst skills in three months and if you want to learn data science skills you can search for code basics data scientist six month roadmap so i have a six month roadmap for data scientist and these roadmaps covers all the free resources you dont have to spend any money you can just learn things on your own all you need is good internet connection a willpower and a laptop so learning skills on your own while youre doing job is a very important tip the next step is after you have learned these skills you want to build a project portfolio the project portfolio which you can put on your resume which you can highlight on your github page so how do i do data science related projects well my channel has a lot of projects so in if you go to my channel and search for codebasics and data analyst projects i have couple of projects and the popular project is sales insight power bi project so in power bi me and my friend we build a analytics dashboard using the sales data and by following this project so many of my subscribers have got a job im not kidding im getting so many messages on linkedin saying that this project helped them get a job so my youtube channel is one way if you are looking for machine learning projects i have another playlist for machine learning projects where i did a project on bangalore property price prediction image classification even i built a mobile app for potato disease classification using deep learning and these are endtoend projects they cover model building making application writing server in fast api these are like end to end project how you would execute these projects in corporate if you got a job fulltime job as a data scientist so by following these projects youre learning important skills and what you need to do is customize these projects so that you can make it a unique project for yourself its not like youre copying my project for example for image classification i did spot celebrity image classification now you can do the image classification for movie personalities or some spiritual personalities or even your family members you can customize it there is so much creativity so you use my projects as a reference but then customize it for a different data set and make it your own unique project you can also go to nearby ngo for example and ask them that you can help them for free nowadays nonprofits will have a threetier application they will have databases and wherever there is data there is data science there is a scope of data science you might have to try multiple times and you might get a success if youre offering your help for free to ngo or even to your relative who might have a small business who might have some database ask them to build some dashboard for free like bi dashboard is an is a no brainer you can do it anytime you have a database you can build cool bi dashboards in power bi and tableau very easily by working on real projects you are learning a lot of real life skills its not like dummy titanic data set project you know then comes kegel participation on kegelcom you can go and participate into competitions i did a video with tanul singh who is a mechanical engineer and after his study in a mechanical engineer every day he would spend few hours on kegel and he built a good reputation on kegel and after his finishing his degree in mechanical he immediately got a job as a data scientist so your kegel rank performance are going to be super helpful now if you feel alone in your journey you can make partners codebasics has a discord server where you can go to partner and group finder channel and find buddies you know you can find friends online friends and you can do group studies group study has many benefits you keep yourself motivated accountable you learn from each other and you generally networking is always useful so use discord server the link is in video description below lets say now i have learned the skills i have a good project portfolio i have built a resume for resume also i have  different videos so you have a build a solid one page resume a resume should not be more than one page doesnt matter even if you have 30 year experience one page resume now you have one page resume what do you do well you start applying for internship theres a portal called intersharla im not marketing for them but there are similar portals you can even use uh your linkedin network you dont build a name a network on linkedin with data guys data guys and girls now these data folks are basically data analyst data scientists working for different companies and you can send them a connection request saying that i want to learn data science i want to connect with you you can have one of phone call conversation offer your help to them and so on and by building these great connections what youre getting out of it is whenever their company have any requirement they will be happy to refer you or when youre following the linkedin post you might get to know about next data science job opportunity so this way linkedin networking is very very very important okay so you build your linkedin network you went through portals like intersharla and you managed to get internship now the confusion arises i am doing my usual 50 000 rupees a month job you know whatever the amount my maybe and now i want to take this internship which is paying me you know only 20 of my current salary should i go for it well it depends on your on your intention like how serious you are about data science transition if youre serious about it take few months salary cut do the internship once you have internship in your resume finding job will become more and more easier so you do one or two internship i know for maybe one year you will be earning less but its worth because once you get a job in data science industry these jobs are very high paid and you can make up for your loss you know during the internship time period the last tip i want to give is many times folks will go for data science master either in your own country or abroad if you go for data science master you are now spending dedicatedly two years in your masters you are learning all the skills the degrees on your resume and after your master of course finding job is going to become easier because then if someone looks at your resumes okay data science degree theyll be like okay the person has at least spent two years of dedicated time in studying data science so that is my last tip but i know youll have to spend money youll have to take a break from your job so be thoughtful if youre going that route but the other tips that i discussed below are actually enough to make a transition now one thing you have to remember is when youre making a transition of course its gonna take time you will keep on applying in different companies you will not get a response dont get demotivated use that time you know maybe start doing open source contribution start helping people on discord start participating on kegel so while youre getting rejection from all your jobs youre still making your data science skills more and more stronger and eventually youre going to get an opportunity i wish you all the best
