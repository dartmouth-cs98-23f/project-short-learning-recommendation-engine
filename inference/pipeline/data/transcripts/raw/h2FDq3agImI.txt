0.0,4.14,so you want to learn artificial
1.8,4.38,intelligence then this video is for you
4.14,4.2,I'm going to provide you with a complete
6.18,4.2,roadmap that I would follow if I had to
8.34,4.5,start over today on my artificial
10.38,4.02,intelligence journey and now for context
12.84,4.32,I started studying artificial
14.4,4.379,intelligence back in 2013 10 years ago
17.16,3.66,and over the past years I've been
18.779,4.141,working as a freelance data scientist
20.82,4.74,helping my clients with various
22.92,5.099,end-to-end data science and artificial
25.56,4.44,intelligence Solutions and applications
28.019,3.6,I also share all of this knowledge and
30.0,4.26,my journey on this YouTube channel which
31.619,4.44,as of today has over 25 000 subscribers
34.26,3.54,and at the end of this video I will also
36.059,3.601,provide you with a resource completely
37.8,3.599,for free where you can follow all of
39.66,4.2,these steps to complete roadmap even
41.399,4.261,with training videos and instructions so
43.86,3.719,make sure to stick around for that and
45.66,3.54,now before we dive into the seven steps
47.579,3.901,that I would take today to go from
49.2,4.679,beginner all the way to monetizing my
51.48,4.44,data and AI skills it's important to
53.879,3.901,provide some context on what is
55.92,3.479,currently going on with the AI hype
57.78,3.84,because I see a lot of new people
59.399,4.5,entering the field and for a good reason
61.62,5.7,because the AI Market size is expected
63.899,6.001,to grow up to 20 volt by the year 2030
67.32,5.4,bringing it all the way to nearly 2
69.9,4.68,trillion US dollars so it's really one
72.72,4.14,of the best opportunities I would say
74.58,4.079,right now to get into because we're
76.86,5.22,still early we're still at the beginning
78.659,5.82,of this AI Revolution and also with the
82.08,4.56,release of these pre-trained models from
84.479,5.401,open AI it's now also easier than ever
86.64,5.76,to enter the field but that said that is
89.88,5.4,also where a lot of the misunderstanding
92.4,4.98,and just wrong expectations arise from
95.28,3.96,because I see a lot of people online as
97.38,3.54,well as on YouTube explaining like how
99.24,4.919,you can quickly start for example your
100.92,5.94,own AI automation agency and while there
104.159,4.681,are great tools already online out there
106.86,3.78,like both press and stack Ai and
108.84,4.559,flowwise which I also made a video on
110.64,5.04,where you can quickly spin up prototypes
113.399,3.781,and and simple Bots and even can get a
115.68,2.88,little bit more advanced don't get me
117.18,4.2,wrong you can definitely build some
118.56,4.199,great Solutions with that but if you
121.38,4.44,really want to learn artificial
122.759,5.28,intelligence and build applications that
125.82,4.499,companies can count on and build upon
128.039,4.621,then you really have to understand the
130.319,4.621,coding part the technical part really of
132.66,4.62,it so that's really where our starting
134.94,4.68,point should be for you and for your
137.28,5.28,learning path figuring out hey do I want
139.62,5.4,to just learn how to use these no code
142.56,4.14,Loco tools already available or do I
145.02,4.14,really want to learn artificial
146.7,4.86,intelligence and with that said there is
149.16,5.76,also just a general misunderstanding I
151.56,6.24,believe of what really AI is because AIS
154.92,4.98,is such a large umbrella term and it's
157.8,5.1,also nothing new it's been around since
159.9,5.64,the 1950s but right now with the chat
162.9,6.72,GPT hype and the open AI models people
165.54,6.3,think AI is that really if we look at
169.62,4.68,what artificial intelligence really is
171.84,5.16,it's like I've said a real big umbrella
174.3,5.1,term with various subfields so for
177.0,4.26,example within artificial intelligence
179.4,3.54,which is here explained as programs with
181.26,3.66,the ability to learn and reason like
182.94,3.659,humans machine learning then we have
184.92,3.78,deep learning which is another subset
186.599,4.86,focusing on neural networks and then we
188.7,4.44,have the field of data science but in my
191.459,3.42,work as a data scientist I use
193.14,4.08,artificial intelligence I use machine
194.879,4.14,learning and I also use deep learning
197.22,4.26,it's a lot more than what people think
199.019,5.341,the first real question that you gotta
201.48,5.64,ask yourself is do you want to be a
204.36,4.56,coder and now there's no right or wrong
207.12,4.02,answer here there are plenty of
208.92,4.56,opportunities right now and also in the
211.14,4.679,future for both Pathways for both local
213.48,5.28,NOCO tools and building custom
215.819,5.461,applications but you just gotta be aware
218.76,4.68,of the pros and cons to both of the
221.28,3.84,sides and not to be totally clear this
223.44,3.24,roadmap is for people that really want
225.12,4.02,to learn AI with the depth of
226.68,4.74,understanding really learn the technical
229.14,3.72,side of things and now if you've decided
231.42,2.879,that that is not for you that's of
232.86,3.06,course totally fine like I said there's
234.299,4.02,no right or wrong but then if you want
235.92,4.62,to still want to do things with AI then
238.319,4.321,I recommend starting out by checking out
240.54,3.839,both press like I've set or stack AI
242.64,3.42,which are excellent resources or you
244.379,3.901,could check out my video on flowwise
246.06,4.86,here on YouTube where I show you how you
248.28,5.099,can get started with a local NOCO 2 as
250.92,4.56,well completely for free but if you do
253.379,4.681,decide that you want to join the Dark
255.48,5.219,Side and become a coder then let's
258.06,4.98,proceed with the next steps my Approach
260.699,4.861,is quite different from anything else
263.04,5.28,you will find online and now why is that
265.56,5.22,and what I typically see online is you
268.32,4.56,have two ends of the the Spectrum
270.78,3.84,basically where on the one hand you have
272.88,4.2,the people talking about these low code
274.62,4.5,and no code tools not really getting
277.08,5.1,into the specific the theoretical part
279.12,4.98,and then on the other hand you have the
282.18,3.48,more classical approaches towards
284.1,3.12,artificial intelligence and machine
285.66,3.599,learning where people really get into
287.22,4.38,the mathematics and the statistics
289.259,4.921,giving you road maps where you really
291.6,5.58,have to get theoretical first I'm a firm
294.18,4.86,believer of learning by doing reverse
297.18,4.38,engineering things that people have
299.04,5.04,already done putting in practice and
301.56,4.139,then trying to fill in the gaps now the
304.08,5.16,technical roadmap that I'm going to
305.699,5.94,provide to you will really focus on the
309.24,4.62,fundamentals that you need in order to
311.639,4.921,get started in either artificial
313.86,5.1,intelligence data science or anything in
316.56,4.139,between like I've said I've worked in
318.96,4.799,all of these fields over the past 10
320.699,6.0,years and I've really identified the
323.759,4.681,core techniques workflows and tools that
326.699,3.72,you need in order to get started
328.44,3.539,regardless of what you want to do so
330.419,3.241,this will work for you if you just want
331.979,3.301,to build applications with large
333.66,3.84,language models and Lang chain for
335.28,5.1,example but it will also work if you
337.5,5.699,aspire to become a data scientist or a
340.38,5.759,machine learning engineer now the actual
343.199,5.761,first step that I would focus on on my
346.139,5.4,AI Journey would be to set up my work
348.96,5.28,environment now what does this mean so
351.539,4.5,python is the go-to language that we
354.24,4.739,have to learn if you want to get started
356.039,4.321,in AI or in data science but the thing
358.979,3.421,is
360.36,4.02,Titan if you start to follow these
362.4,4.38,tutorials online videos training videos
364.38,4.44,courses even you can quite quickly
366.78,3.479,understand Python and how it works
368.82,5.219,because it's one of the easiest
370.259,5.461,languages to get started with but I
374.039,4.021,found in my personal Journey that
375.72,4.8,there's this initial bump where you see
378.06,4.919,things online and you see people run
380.52,4.44,some code but then you are missing some
382.979,4.5,information on okay but how do I now
384.96,3.299,actually do this on my laptop on my
387.479,3.84,computer
388.259,5.401,and I would really focus on this first
391.319,4.44,setting up an environment on your laptop
393.66,3.96,on your computer where you have an
395.759,4.5,application a program and a python
397.62,5.76,installation that you are confident with
400.259,6.301,and now I have a specific approach that
403.38,5.759,I take over here within fias code and a
406.56,4.38,lot of people seem to like that so make
409.139,4.081,sure to check that out in the resources
410.94,4.379,but this really is step one they're
413.22,4.74,getting accustomed with that and that
415.319,4.921,brings us then to step two which is
417.96,4.32,actually getting started with python
420.24,4.799,it's like I said the most important
422.28,4.08,language this is going to be your tool
425.039,3.72,that you're going to build these
426.36,4.26,applications in now if you're new to
428.759,4.44,programming at all I would first focus
430.62,4.44,on the fundamentals of programming which
433.199,4.141,I will have resources to but then
435.06,4.8,quickly transition into learning the
437.34,5.699,basics of python and then specifically
439.86,6.36,some libraries that are very useful for
443.039,5.521,AI and data science in particular so
446.22,4.979,these would be for example the numpy AI
448.56,4.8,Library the pandas library and the matte
451.199,4.321,plus lib library now these are all
453.36,4.14,libraries that you can use to do data
455.52,3.78,manipulation data cleaning creating
457.5,4.02,visualizations this is really your
459.3,4.739,starting point for starting to work with
461.52,5.579,data because in the end all AI
464.039,6.6,applications all AI tools are created
467.099,5.641,from data with data so being able to
470.639,5.4,work with data and turn raw and
472.74,4.92,unstructured data into information into
476.039,4.141,valuable insights that you can actually
477.66,4.979,do something with is is really at the
480.18,5.519,core of of artificial intelligence and
482.639,6.06,now step three would be to learn the
485.699,6.06,very basics of git and GitHub now why is
488.699,4.62,that some would argue that that would be
491.759,3.421,a little bit more advanced and it's not
493.319,3.541,required in the beginning but what I've
495.18,3.54,found especially with artificial
496.86,4.32,intelligence and also the video
498.72,4.56,tutorials that I make is that a lot of
501.18,4.98,examples online people will make that
503.28,4.859,code available via GitHub but you have
506.16,4.62,to understand kind of at the very base
508.139,5.221,sick how these tools work because that
510.78,5.04,allows you to easily copy and clone is
513.36,4.679,what they call it tutorials that brings
515.82,4.98,us to step 4 which is working on
518.039,5.401,projects and building a portfolio and
520.8,4.56,for this it's convenient if you already
523.44,3.66,know how to use git so you can download
525.36,4.02,some projects download some code from
527.1,4.859,from other people and then try to
529.38,5.16,reverse engineer it to me that really is
531.959,5.161,the best way to to Learn Python to get
534.54,5.58,good to actually understand holistically
537.12,4.74,what a project looks like how people are
540.12,4.26,structuring their code and trying to run
541.86,4.56,it and then you don't understand what's
544.38,3.899,going on but then trying to reverse
546.42,4.74,engineer so it's really like beginning
548.279,5.401,with the end in mind and then trying to
551.16,4.739,change things and see how that affects
553.68,4.62,the different outcomes and this also
555.899,5.821,provides you with an opportunity to
558.3,5.7,explore what it is specifically that you
561.72,3.78,like about artificial intelligence all
564.0,3.12,the areas we've discussed computer
565.5,3.6,vision natural language processing
567.12,4.14,machine learning he here you really find
569.1,3.84,out okay these are all the kinds of
571.26,3.96,things that I can do and this is really
572.94,4.44,what I like to do and then as you're
575.22,4.2,working on these projects selecting them
577.38,3.54,picking them you there will be a lot of
579.42,3.72,gaps and and things you don't understand
580.92,4.26,and that would be a good point if you're
583.14,4.98,interested in that to find specific
585.18,5.339,pieces of information or courses to help
588.12,5.46,you with just that and now when it comes
590.519,5.341,to projects probably the best place to
593.58,4.319,start if you want to learn more about
595.86,4.56,data science and machine learning is
597.899,5.461,kaggle so kaggle is an excellent
600.42,5.16,resource that you can go through and
603.36,3.84,they host machine learning competitions
605.58,3.72,here so you can see all kinds of
607.2,3.84,requests and you can even win prizes so
609.3,4.92,this is one from Google and the cool
611.04,6.18,thing here is if you click on the actual
614.22,4.799,competition you can also actually have a
617.22,3.84,look at submissions that people have
619.019,4.38,made so here you can see an entire
621.06,5.52,notebook from someone
623.399,5.94,that is trying to solve this problem for
626.58,5.46,Google all with documentation and and
629.339,5.461,even the code so this is such an
632.04,4.32,excellent learning resources source that
634.8,5.28,you can go through like I said there are
636.36,5.94,plenty plenty of resources available on
640.08,3.84,here but if that's not for you machine
642.3,4.38,learning data science if you want to
643.92,4.62,just explore large language models in
646.68,4.14,open AI for example right now then I
648.54,4.68,recommend to check out my GitHub
650.82,4.44,repository on Lang chain experiments so
653.22,3.66,I also have videos on my YouTube channel
655.26,3.54,for that but here on the repository
656.88,3.84,that's why it's good that you at least
658.8,3.9,understand the basics of git and GitHub
660.72,3.84,so you can take this code know how to
662.7,4.079,work with it so here are some cool
664.56,3.779,examples of how you connect can create a
666.779,4.5,YouTube bot that can summarize a video
668.339,4.381,or even a slack bolt or a Ponders agent
671.279,4.381,that can ask questions and answer
672.72,4.14,questions about large data tables and
675.66,2.94,now if you're really serious about
676.86,3.719,learning artificial intelligence and
678.6,4.26,data science and another great resource
680.579,4.801,that you can check out is Project Pro
682.86,5.28,which I've recently discovered so
685.38,5.459,project Pro is a curated library of
688.14,4.68,verified and solved end-to-end project
690.839,4.74,Solutions in data science machine
692.82,5.16,learning and big data so overall this is
695.579,4.621,just an excellent resource with with so
697.98,4.56,much information and all the projects on
700.2,4.98,here that you can pick from all from the
702.54,4.979,various fields are all created by top
705.18,4.56,industry experts from leading tech
707.519,5.101,companies so what I really like about
709.74,4.62,this is first of all you have about 3
712.62,3.24,000 free recipes that like anyone can
714.36,3.24,check out but if you get to the
715.86,4.08,subscription and that is why it really
717.6,4.979,gets interesting you have access to 250
719.94,4.74,plus end-to-end projects so you can
722.579,3.241,really like go in here and see okay what
724.68,2.64,is it that you're working on so maybe
725.82,4.079,it's data science and you want to
727.32,5.04,specialize in machine learning and you
729.899,5.221,go in here you literally have all kinds
732.36,5.46,of projects and this is not only a great
735.12,4.64,resource for you to learn from because
737.82,4.68,you will have complete video
739.76,4.54,walkthroughs 24 7 support and you can
742.5,3.779,ask questions and and you can even
744.3,3.42,download all of the code so literally
746.279,3.781,the entire project will be made
747.72,4.679,available to you so it's a excellent
750.06,4.08,Learning Resource but also for me
752.399,3.661,personally working as a freelance data
754.14,4.62,scientist this can also like really help
756.06,4.62,me in my professional work that the
758.76,4.319,projects that I take on so for you that
760.68,4.56,could either be in your job or in future
763.079,4.021,jobs freelancing whatever you really
765.24,3.839,have a library that you can pick from
767.1,4.26,that can really give you that extra kind
769.079,4.861,of confidence you need for example to
771.36,4.86,take on a project now like I've said
773.94,4.079,really you see video instructions you
776.22,4.619,can go through everything and then also
778.019,4.56,download the code so this really is a
780.839,3.12,great resource that you can check out
782.579,3.421,and if you want to learn more about this
783.959,4.44,I will leave a link down in the
786.0,3.959,description and project Pro also has a
788.399,3.481,YouTube channel which you can subscribe
789.959,4.62,to if you want to stay in the loop learn
791.88,4.5,more on that and that brings us to step
794.579,4.141,five which is picking your
796.38,4.98,specialization and sharing your
798.72,5.16,knowledge so right now you understand
801.36,4.5,the fundamentals of python you have a
803.88,4.68,work environment and some some efficient
805.86,4.919,workflows that you can follow you also
808.56,4.68,have some project experience so now you
810.779,4.261,get a little bit more clarity of what it
813.24,3.96,is that you want to do within the world
815.04,4.02,of AI or data science or machine
817.2,4.439,learning so this would be the point
819.06,4.98,where you pick a focus area you
821.639,4.021,specialize you try to learn more and
824.04,4.2,also what I really would recommend and
825.66,4.5,what I would do is to start sharing your
828.24,3.24,knowledge so you could do this through a
830.16,3.66,personal blog you could do this through
831.48,3.9,writing articles on medium or towards
833.82,3.54,data science or you could even
835.38,4.56,potentially like I'm doing share your
837.36,4.919,your knowledge on YouTube and by doing
839.94,4.74,so you're not only contributing to the
842.279,5.281,collective knowledge on AI and data
844.68,5.459,science but it's also an essential
847.56,5.279,method for you to strengthen your own
850.139,5.041,learning because in doing so in
852.839,4.081,explaining Concepts that you're working
855.18,4.32,on that you're learning to to someone
856.92,4.74,else you really start to identify the
859.5,5.1,gaps within your understanding and this
861.66,5.04,again allows you to fill in those gaps
864.6,4.56,accordingly and really focus on some
866.7,4.5,specialized learning versus just going
869.16,5.64,through course after course after course
871.2,6.0,and then step six would be continue to
874.8,4.62,learn and upskill because now that you
877.2,3.54,have Clarity on your specialization and
879.42,3.419,kind of the direction that you want to
880.74,4.62,go and you also start to identify these
882.839,4.8,gaps within your own understanding
885.36,6.479,it might be time for you to for example
887.639,5.521,focus on math focus on statistics if you
891.839,4.201,want to become a better machine learning
893.16,4.38,engineer or a data scientist but if
896.04,3.9,you've decided to go with the large
897.54,5.64,language model and generative AI route
899.94,5.28,you might identify that you need some
903.18,4.5,software engineering skills actually
905.22,4.2,really start to understand how you can
907.68,4.32,work with with apis and create
909.42,5.279,applications and that's like I think the
912.0,4.8,main main message that I wanna want to
914.699,5.661,provide you with with regards to this
916.8,6.24,roadmap and and my Approach is that it's
920.36,4.539,everyone's journey is is unique and
923.04,3.96,depending on what you want to do with AI
924.899,4.44,there's a specialized learning path for
927.0,3.959,you specifically so my goal is to really
929.339,3.841,provide you with the tools and
930.959,5.341,techniques to quickly get going
933.18,5.82,get your hands dirty identify problems
936.3,6.3,work on projects and then fill in those
939.0,6.36,gaps and then finally step 7 would be to
942.6,5.16,monetize your skills now this could
945.36,4.26,either be through a job this could be
947.76,5.04,through freelancing or this could be
949.62,5.579,through building a product but where the
952.8,5.159,real Learning Happens is is when there
955.199,4.681,really is some pressure onto it so it's
957.959,4.021,all fun and games when you're trying to
959.88,4.019,explore this within your free time
961.98,4.56,following some courses following some
963.899,4.261,tutorials but when it's your boss or
966.54,4.08,when it's a client that's that's
968.16,5.039,breathing down your neck for the
970.62,4.68,deadline that is where you really push
973.199,5.341,yourself that is where you really get
975.3,6.0,creative get resourceful and try to
978.54,6.479,absorb and learn as much information as
981.3,5.88,possible to just get the job done and
985.019,4.081,that's it those are the seven steps that
987.18,5.279,I would take today if I had to start
989.1,6.599,over completely from scratch on my AI
992.459,5.82,Journey and now another bonus tip that I
995.699,5.041,can provide you which will make a great
998.279,4.92,difference is surround yourself with
1000.74,4.98,like-minded individuals who are on the
1003.199,4.2,same track the same path as you who
1005.72,4.2,share the same interest where you can
1007.399,5.221,bounce ideas off where you can share the
1009.92,5.64,latest news and tips with and in order
1012.62,4.86,to facilitate that for you as well I
1015.56,5.459,have an exciting announcement because
1017.48,6.9,today I will officially be releasing my
1021.019,6.42,free group called Data alchemy that I
1024.38,5.52,would like you all to invite you this
1027.439,4.681,will be a group where I not only share
1029.9,4.14,the complete and entire roadmap that I
1032.12,4.799,just shared with you with all the links
1034.04,5.639,resources tools it will also be a hub
1036.919,4.681,your go-to place to navigate the world
1039.679,3.961,of data science and artificial
1041.6,4.62,intelligence and everything that's going
1043.64,5.94,on and happening right now within this
1046.22,4.8,rapidly changing field so if you're
1049.58,3.36,serious about learning artificial
1051.02,4.26,intelligence and data science and you
1052.94,4.5,also also want access to not only this
1055.28,4.86,entire roadmap but additional courses
1057.44,5.04,and resources then make sure to check
