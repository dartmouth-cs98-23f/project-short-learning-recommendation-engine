6.72,4.16,welcome to day two
8.88,4.639,we've talked a lot so far about the
10.88,4.08,impact of research on society
13.519,3.281,on the collective
14.96,3.92,but of course the collective is really a
16.8,3.6,collection of individuals
18.88,4.239,this morning we'll take a look at the
20.4,4.16,human side of technology at individual
23.119,3.761,experiences
24.56,4.24,we see a need for increased focus on
26.88,4.0,creating technologies that can meet us
28.8,4.56,where we are as individuals wherever
30.88,5.359,that happens to be in terms of identity
33.36,4.719,ability or societal context
36.239,3.441,this brings us to the field of human
38.079,3.441,computer interaction
39.68,4.0,one of microsoft's longest standing
41.52,4.64,research areas which has led to things
43.68,4.8,like connect smart assistance and many
46.16,4.399,other innovative technologies
48.48,5.04,it's now my pleasure to introduce one of
50.559,4.801,the pioneers in the field mary serwinski
53.52,4.16,to share some of the latest work to make
55.36,3.44,our interactions with technology more
57.68,5.12,natural
58.8,4.0,more intuitive and more empowering
65.28,4.879,human computer interaction or hci is a
68.24,2.96,critical part of the design of computing
70.159,2.721,systems
71.2,4.08,it has formerly been around as a field
72.88,4.08,since the 1960s though of course the
75.28,3.12,study of human factors predates that
76.96,3.12,time period
78.4,3.92,most technology companies that care
80.08,4.48,about their users have hci researchers
82.32,4.479,as part of their product design process
84.56,3.76,so it made sense that microsoft research
86.799,3.761,which pushes ahead of the product teams
88.32,4.56,by several years would also incorporate
90.56,4.239,hci researchers as new systems are
92.88,3.919,invented and evaluated before they are
94.799,3.921,released to the public i happen to be
96.799,4.96,the first social scientist hired into
98.72,5.52,microsoft research back in 1996 or so
101.759,4.72,today my latest count shows over 70 phd
104.24,4.32,scientists that identify as hci
106.479,3.521,researchers worldwide in microsoft
108.56,4.16,research
110.0,4.64,hci deals with the design execution and
112.72,3.6,assessment of computer systems and
114.64,2.56,related phenomenon that are for human
116.32,2.56,use
117.2,3.44,the goal of the discipline is to make
118.88,4.879,sure that the technologies we develop
120.64,4.96,are useful usable safe and enjoyable to
123.759,3.68,interact with for all people so that
125.6,3.999,humans can achieve their tasks whether
127.439,4.961,that's to get work done learn be
129.599,4.961,creative communicate or just play
132.4,4.08,in order to fulfill these goals tech
134.56,3.84,companies must attempt to
136.48,3.28,understand how people use technologies
138.4,2.32,and build systems based on that
139.76,3.839,knowledge
140.72,4.96,design or invent efficient effective and
143.599,3.441,safe interaction techniques for using
145.68,4.0,new systems
147.04,4.72,and put people first people's needs
149.68,4.4,capabilities and preferences should come
151.76,3.759,before the technology the new technology
154.08,4.0,invented should be designed to meet
155.519,4.161,users needs and requirements first not
158.08,3.2,the other way around
159.68,3.52,why is this important
161.28,3.599,a good user interface can improve
163.2,3.92,financial outcomes because the
164.879,4.801,experience can increase users loyalty
167.12,4.8,trust and make users happy ensuring
169.68,4.08,continued interaction with the system
171.92,3.92,we know this first hand on my team
173.76,3.839,because we study user emotion and we can
175.84,3.92,see happiness go up when interactions
177.599,4.72,with software allows user to get their
179.76,4.24,work done more effectively for example
182.319,3.521,we've seen evidence that users smile
184.0,3.68,significantly more often when good
185.84,3.44,search results come back quickly and
187.68,2.88,users don't have to reformulate their
189.28,3.12,search queries
190.56,3.36,happy users come back to use software
192.4,3.6,that pleases them
193.92,3.679,most hci researchers come from a varied
196.0,2.48,background of multi-disciplinary and
197.599,3.441,training
198.48,5.119,including computer science obviously
201.04,4.559,psychology because it studies people and
203.599,3.28,application of theories and methods
205.599,3.28,sociology for understanding
206.879,4.881,computer-mediated technology and
208.879,4.401,organizations and even industrial design
211.76,5.68,for the design of interactive products
213.28,6.879,like cars laptops mobile phones etc as
217.44,4.56,technology evolves ever more rapidly
220.159,2.881,human cognition remains relatively
222.0,3.36,stable
223.04,4.0,it's important now more than ever to
225.36,4.08,ensure that humans can use and
227.04,4.96,understand the design of new systems as
229.44,4.48,they emerge especially with the advent
232.0,4.959,of newly automated systems like
233.92,6.0,self-driving cars robots and telehealth
236.959,4.56,how do we as a society leverage hci to
239.92,4.879,ensure that these systems are designed
241.519,5.28,for human safety comfort and well-being
244.799,3.921,to that end let's take a tour of some of
246.799,4.881,the labs and researchers we have at msr
248.72,4.64,microsoft research working in hci i'm
251.68,3.759,super excited to give you a mini tour of
253.36,3.599,hci in the redmond labs here in building
255.439,3.681,99
256.959,3.201,first we're going to meet mar gonzalez
259.12,2.56,franco
260.16,3.68,mar is a principal researcher with the
261.68,3.6,epic research group she wonders what
263.84,3.68,spatial computing can tell us about
265.28,3.76,human behavior and how we can expand
267.52,3.04,digital content for immersive
269.04,3.2,experiences
270.56,3.52,beyond helping to create new ways of
272.24,4.399,experiencing technology through virtual
274.08,4.8,and augmented reality mars work explores
276.639,4.201,how new devices and technologies impact
278.88,3.52,our perception and
280.84,3.96,behavior
282.4,4.56,i'm margunthalet franco and this is the
284.8,4.32,epic lab the standard perception
286.96,4.959,interaction and cognition lab what we do
289.12,5.04,here is we explore the digital content
291.919,5.121,around us and we try to implement new
294.16,5.2,sensory abilities to it so that means we
297.04,4.96,studied very deeply perception
299.36,5.279,and we studied the behaviors that come
302.0,4.56,with the perception that we produce with
304.639,3.361,the new devices
306.56,4.079,so you might think perception and
308.0,3.44,behavior are very far apart it's a big
310.639,2.801,leap
311.44,4.08,but the truth is not and i think
313.44,4.479,studying behavior with understanding
315.52,4.48,perception is just missing part of it
317.919,4.641,because perception how we perceive the
320.0,4.96,world is going to change how we behave
322.56,4.8,and the ecological way to explore how
324.96,4.88,our prototypes are going to affect the
327.36,5.92,lives of millions when they go out
329.84,6.56,uh is to study both together
333.28,5.52,we're humans are visual animals right
336.4,4.799,it's been traditionally our method of
338.8,3.6,displaying information for
341.199,2.881,um
342.4,2.88,digital content it's been through
344.08,3.52,screens
345.28,5.04,and through bissell but
347.6,4.96,we are multi-sensory animals and we have
350.32,4.159,evolved to have multi-sensory
352.56,3.84,experiences which are far more
354.479,3.921,fulfilling
356.4,4.4,for example
358.4,4.16,audio is
360.8,4.959,we have more precision with audio
362.56,6.56,sometimes on a spatial because we our
365.759,5.44,eyes only look forward and audio is you
369.12,4.24,know all around us so we can hear things
371.199,4.081,that are on our back but we cannot see
373.36,5.04,things that are on our backs so it's
375.28,5.759,clearly something that we can enhance
378.4,4.56,our experiences with devices if we think
381.039,3.681,on a holistic way
382.96,3.2,what are the different sensors that
384.72,3.599,humans have
386.16,4.24,so you might ask why is this important
388.319,4.801,now right computers have been here for a
390.4,4.48,while and i think there's been a change
393.12,3.44,in paradigm in how we understand
394.88,3.92,computing
396.56,5.199,until now we had the screens in front of
398.8,4.959,us digital content was inside
401.759,5.681,more recently we're seeing a lot of
403.759,5.84,spatial computing devices that render
407.44,3.92,the digital content around us and that
409.599,3.841,that's changing a little bit how we're
411.36,4.559,gonna interact with the content
413.44,5.199,and in particular it's augmenting how we
415.919,5.201,need the sensory abilities to match
418.639,4.56,um and interact with the content if we
421.12,5.04,see an
423.199,5.041,object in front of us that we can grab
426.16,4.8,we want to feel that experience right
428.24,5.92,this is a sensory motor loop
430.96,5.679,that needs to be fulfilled
434.16,5.2,so i have some prototypes here
436.639,5.12,uh that i can show you
439.36,4.48,and i think they will explain a bit more
441.759,4.481,what we mean by augmenting the sensory
443.84,5.12,experience and perception so i want to
446.24,5.44,start with this one i love this one
448.96,4.959,this is called the keyboard and and you
451.68,3.359,you'll clearly see very easily how it
453.919,3.84,works but
455.039,4.641,um imagine well now it's in the northern
457.759,3.84,hemisphere it's apple picking season
459.68,3.76,right so imagine you're picking apples
461.599,2.961,inside virtual reality or augmented
463.44,4.56,reality
464.56,5.12,and as you go for the apple
468.0,3.52,the people comes to you and you just
469.68,3.359,grab it and it's such a fulfilling
471.52,4.0,experience
473.039,4.641,that once you've tried it it feels empty
475.52,3.679,to go into virtual reality without
477.68,3.359,haptic controllers
479.199,4.72,so we experiment a lot with these type
481.039,5.681,of things and we have
483.919,3.921,devices that
486.72,4.8,basically
487.84,5.759,extrude and will change the
491.52,3.359,normal as you're touching through a
493.599,2.561,surface
494.879,2.72,um
496.16,3.599,and you'll see there are many of them
497.599,4.72,that are controllers that you'll be
499.759,5.081,wearing but we're also trying to amend
502.319,5.201,the desktop so this is a new type of
504.84,4.12,fabrication based on aesthetic materials
507.52,3.84,we just publish it in nature
508.96,5.12,communication we're able to reduce a
511.36,4.88,shape display into nine actuators only
514.08,4.48,by changing how we
516.24,5.359,fabricate the materials on top of it
518.56,6.56,right so you you will touch for example
521.599,5.441,a shape and move around and be able to
525.12,4.159,experience a whole shape
527.04,4.88,and we have also these very cute ones
529.279,4.961,which are mini robots that come
531.92,4.4,just in time for whatever you want to
534.24,5.039,touch
536.32,4.959,so all of this is the
539.279,4.081,nice set of prototypes but there is
541.279,3.921,science behind it right
543.36,3.919,there are things we found
545.2,4.079,for example like the uncanny valley of
547.279,4.081,haptics that you can
549.279,3.921,go deep into this sensation that you
551.36,4.08,break the illusion because the haptics
553.2,4.72,don't match correctly uh what you're
555.44,6.48,expecting we publish that in science
557.92,6.8,robotics and i think it's hard sometimes
561.92,7.359,to detach theory from practice because
564.72,7.119,if you don't learn the theory behind it
569.279,5.201,you will not be able to replicate right
571.839,4.961,so many days we're inside but we also go
574.48,5.76,outside right we want to see how these
576.8,4.96,technologies go in the wild and we study
580.24,4.96,beyond touch
581.76,6.32,all sort of perception behind me you see
585.2,5.28,a bit of a vestibulator which will you
588.08,5.52,know we used to study vestibular system
590.48,5.76,but we also study a lot of sound because
593.6,5.28,once you are inside the content sound is
596.24,5.279,spatial like in real life which is also
598.88,5.92,a very big change in paradigm compared
601.519,5.841,to using the screens and
604.8,4.24,so in that area i'm working a lot with
607.36,4.8,the team of soundscape microsoft
609.04,6.239,soundscape they are enabling blind and
612.16,5.84,low bcn people uh to go around the world
615.279,5.521,and travel with a different form of gps
618.0,4.72,which is based on beacons it's a
620.8,2.96,different form of navigation if you
622.72,3.119,think of
623.76,4.16,the human
625.839,4.801,you know we were living in forests we
627.92,5.28,would hear sounds travel towards a
630.64,4.8,source of water we would hear
633.2,4.24,and you know that that would create a
635.44,4.32,mental map as we were going there so we
637.44,4.72,could return to the origin
639.76,5.68,and and more recently you know this idea
642.16,4.64,of sound emitting
645.44,5.2,systems
646.8,6.0,has been used in modern society right uh
650.64,2.96,churches minarets
652.8,4.0,and
653.6,5.44,mosques produce sound for people to know
656.8,4.08,and locate where they are so we're
659.04,4.479,trying to do that but with digital
660.88,4.88,content all around us i it would be
663.519,3.921,great if the pharmacy made noise so i
665.76,3.759,could go there and find where the
667.44,4.32,pharmacy is so we're trying to create
669.519,5.361,that type of experience
671.76,4.16,in particular i recommend reading this
674.88,3.12,uh
675.92,4.4,piece we put out in scientific american
678.0,4.079,just a couple of months back
680.32,3.68,so there are many of these subjects
682.079,3.681,we're thinking like apples that are
684.0,4.079,static right but
685.76,4.079,the truth is once you put this on you
688.079,2.801,might be talking to an avatar for
689.839,3.841,example
690.88,5.12,so we work a lot on avatars and we're
693.68,5.04,trying to figure out how people behave
696.0,5.04,with alberto lavataran there's so many
698.72,4.32,possible applications that it's even
701.04,4.56,beyond what we can do
703.04,4.4,for the particular case uh you know all
705.6,4.08,these applications of avatars but for
707.44,5.199,the particular case of ai i think we
709.68,4.159,have a duty there right um
712.639,3.76,we're
713.839,3.761,creating synthetic data currently people
716.399,2.801,are creating
717.6,3.2,training
719.2,4.48,self-driving cars
720.8,4.719,in environments that have no avatars
723.68,4.48,so you you basically have no
725.519,4.961,representation of humans there in many
728.16,4.96,cases we're just training
730.48,4.56,you know can you stop a designer and we
733.12,4.959,need to have the random
735.04,4.72,behavior of humans also inside there to
738.079,3.841,really have a good
739.76,3.68,digital substitute of real life
741.92,5.12,scenarios
743.44,4.88,and it's even more interesting because
747.04,3.599,once you have
748.32,4.16,humans in there you can trigger actions
750.639,2.801,that would happen very rarely in real
752.48,3.68,life
753.44,5.839,so you can cover many more scenarios
756.16,4.64,than if you're to record real footage so
759.279,2.721,synthetic training i think it's
760.8,5.44,something that
762.0,7.2,is of particular interest for ai and and
766.24,4.96,the merge of this avatar and
769.2,4.56,an ai content
771.2,5.36,so we have been very strong at releasing
773.76,5.759,libraries for everyone to use like the
776.56,5.12,microsoft rocketbox avatar library so
779.519,4.161,people around the world are also
781.68,4.8,exploring these ideas of how you
783.68,5.36,interact with this digital content and
786.48,6.479,avatars in this case and we have people
789.04,5.52,in the nih uh studying the psychological
792.959,2.88,responses
794.56,4.48,uh
795.839,6.0,in stanford ucl you know universities
799.04,4.96,around the world are using our avatars
801.839,4.481,so there is you know all sort of
804.0,5.04,applications and we're trying to see
806.32,6.4,where it goes uh also by providing means
809.04,6.08,for everyone to do research in this area
812.72,4.16,let's move on to hear from teddy sayed
815.12,3.839,teddy is a senior researcher in the ryze
816.88,4.079,group at microsoft research and also
818.959,3.361,leads the future of wearables team he
820.959,3.201,looks into the question of how
822.32,4.24,technology allows us to express our
824.16,4.08,identity we'll join teddy now to hear
826.56,3.839,more about how smart fabrics and
828.24,4.08,wearables are used to create unique new
830.399,3.841,user interfaces to explore human
832.32,4.48,computer interaction in new areas
834.24,4.0,including fashion
836.8,3.36,my name is teddy said and i'm a senior
838.24,3.2,researcher at microsoft research i'm in
840.16,2.32,the ryze group and i lead the future of
841.44,2.8,wearables team
842.48,4.24,and so what i work on is really about
844.24,4.0,connected textiles intelligent textiles
846.72,3.6,wearables and really anything in between
848.24,4.0,that involves textiles in general
850.32,4.24,so speaking of textiles you can think of
852.24,4.48,textiles is you know stuff that's around
854.56,4.399,you every day it's in your clothing it's
856.72,3.28,on the couch you sit on it's in your gym
858.959,2.721,bag
860.0,3.04,really it's well into the fabric of
861.68,2.88,everything and every
863.04,3.12,thing we do every day
864.56,2.8,so you can imagine being at home or
866.16,3.119,working from home you're sitting on a
867.36,3.44,couch you're using your laptop you know
869.279,3.521,you're wearing clothing there's you know
870.8,3.36,the couch all those things have fabric
872.8,4.0,embedded in them and they're all really
874.16,3.919,woven around what we do today and then
876.8,3.52,when we think of
878.079,3.921,you know the textile experiences also
880.32,4.24,the social experiences right there's the
882.0,4.0,aspect of creativity and expression and
884.56,3.12,the clothing that we wear the activities
886.0,3.519,that we go to you'd imagine being at a
887.68,3.68,large concert or some really interesting
889.519,3.68,event out in public
891.36,4.159,but the whole point of this is a lot of
893.199,4.161,it you know clothing and textiles is a
895.519,3.601,part of what we do and it's really woven
897.36,3.52,into what we do every day
899.12,3.04,so when i talk about smart textiles and
900.88,2.8,intelligent textiles and connected
902.16,3.119,experiences what i'm really meaning here
903.68,3.44,is imagine there's some sort of
905.279,2.8,intelligence some type of sensing some
907.12,3.04,type of
908.079,4.721,interesting interaction enabled by a
910.16,4.16,textile um so when i think of this
912.8,3.36,entire space of textiles that i've
914.32,3.84,mentioned you know i like to think of it
916.16,3.76,as an ocean right and there's this whole
918.16,3.039,ocean and we're moving across this ocean
919.92,3.52,you know there's many companies
921.199,3.681,microsoft apple google et cetera et
923.44,4.639,cetera we're all trying to move in this
924.88,4.959,ocean but the problem here is that you
928.079,4.241,know the vehicle which we're moving on
929.839,4.0,this ocean is really a boat but it's a
932.32,3.6,boat made of car parts we're using
933.839,3.44,really chunky hardware we're using you
935.92,3.44,know maybe not the most optimized
937.279,3.281,software or hardware experiences
939.36,3.919,it's really chunky and so i like to
940.56,5.12,think of the space as moving forward
943.279,4.24,with a boat made of car parts but what
945.68,4.159,we're really looking for is moving this
947.519,4.32,space forward with boat parts so we need
949.839,3.44,stuff to be integrated into the fabric
951.839,2.8,we need gestures to be integrated into
953.279,3.521,the fabric we need the technology really
954.639,3.76,to be woven into what we do in everyday
956.8,2.959,life which i had mentioned earlier and
958.399,3.44,this really ties it back to mark
959.759,4.561,weiser's vision of ubiquitous computing
961.839,4.881,where you know computing is woven in
964.32,3.439,into the fabric of everyday life
966.72,3.039,so this is really what i mean about
967.759,4.801,smart textiles experiences and we want
969.759,4.721,to do is make the technology uh make
972.56,3.6,that boat better so how are we going to
974.48,3.2,do that as i mentioned before you know
976.16,2.799,we're in this ocean space and we want to
977.68,2.719,do a lot of
978.959,2.641,work that moves it forward we want
980.399,2.56,technology to be integrated into the
981.6,3.679,fabric we want it to be part of the
982.959,3.921,textile so you can imagine how are we
985.279,3.841,actually going to integrate sensing into
986.88,3.519,fabric because you can imagine there's
989.12,2.719,not going to be cameras available all
990.399,3.841,the time if we're sitting on a couch at
991.839,3.601,home watching a sports game or a movie
994.24,2.8,and our hands are dirty what are we
995.44,3.44,going to do well here would be a nice
997.04,3.919,use case of actually having textile
998.88,3.759,sensing integrated
1000.959,3.041,and in forbitrio we looked at how do we
1002.639,2.64,actually integrate sensing into the
1004.0,3.04,fabric and we came up with a pretty
1005.279,3.041,clever way of using machine learning to
1007.04,3.76,detect different gestures whether it's
1008.32,3.84,tap or click or even wave so traditional
1010.8,2.479,techniques that you see with camera we
1012.16,2.96,can actually do
1013.279,3.521,directly with fabric which i think is
1015.12,3.6,really really cool
1016.8,3.2,but moving beyond just sensing one of
1018.72,3.52,the challenges that we have with
1020.0,4.16,textiles is that textiles deform and
1022.24,3.439,there's a challenge of deformation and
1024.16,3.919,so what i mean by deformation is imagine
1025.679,4.0,you have a sensor directly on your shirt
1028.079,2.88,and if i scrunch it up this sensor is
1029.679,2.721,probably not going to work so how do we
1030.959,2.72,solve that this is what i mean by
1032.4,2.559,deformation
1033.679,2.481,so in
1034.959,2.161,this next part you're going to see here
1036.16,2.639,we're actually trying to solve for
1037.12,3.52,deformation and so the first place we
1038.799,3.841,solved this for was the pocket because
1040.64,4.0,the pocket is one place where you can
1042.64,3.679,put objects in it deforms quite heavily
1044.64,3.199,and if you can solve for a pocket you
1046.319,2.961,can most likely solve for the shirt in
1047.839,2.641,your gym bag that you take out and put
1049.28,2.48,on
1050.48,3.04,so here we're actually using some pretty
1051.76,3.039,cover again clever techniques with
1053.52,3.36,machine learning detect different
1054.799,4.0,objects that go into your pocket and not
1056.88,3.36,just objects but also uh gestures as
1058.799,4.721,well which is again one again going back
1060.24,4.64,to the to the areas of focus for hdi
1063.52,3.279,and last but not least i haven't touched
1064.88,3.84,upon in the previous two projects the
1066.799,3.921,human side right if you think of this
1068.72,4.079,whole space as an ecosystem
1070.72,3.839,right now this ocean is really being
1072.799,3.681,pulled by technology companies which is
1074.559,3.201,something i am you know not really
1076.48,2.8,passionate about i am passionate about
1077.76,3.12,wearables and we are as well at
1079.28,3.44,microsoft but this space should be
1080.88,2.88,really led by designers by apparel
1082.72,3.28,brands by the people that actually
1083.76,4.0,understand and have history with
1086.0,3.2,apparels and textiles
1087.76,3.52,so the idea here with project brookdale
1089.2,3.92,is can we empower that community to have
1091.28,4.24,that experience can we create textiles
1093.12,4.0,can we create apis can create hardware
1095.52,2.8,software experiences that enable them to
1097.12,2.4,then design
1098.32,3.2,you know the experiences that we want in
1099.52,4.48,the future for myself i don't want to be
1101.52,4.48,creating the next wearable textile or
1104.0,3.28,the next wearable but i want them to be
1106.0,3.12,empowered by the work that we do at
1107.28,3.12,microsoft which is our goal here
1109.12,2.72,and in project brookdale we ended up
1110.4,2.8,going to new york and the reason why we
1111.84,3.28,went to new york is obviously new york
1113.2,3.2,is a global fashion hub
1115.12,3.52,and a lot of interesting creative
1116.4,4.24,designers live there
1118.64,3.68,and work there and so by going there we
1120.64,3.919,want to actually explore what is it like
1122.32,4.8,to empower you know a set of designers
1124.559,4.721,with tools hardware software to create
1127.12,3.76,interesting wearable experiences and by
1129.28,3.92,this i mean you know using tattoo
1130.88,4.159,sensors using motion sensors using
1133.2,3.599,lights all the things that kind of exist
1135.039,3.52,today in the space of wearables can we
1136.799,3.281,design tools for them to empower them
1138.559,3.521,the idea here being
1140.08,3.44,if we want the space to be led by that
1142.08,3.599,industry we need to work with them side
1143.52,3.6,by side hci we really focus on the human
1145.679,3.441,side as well as the computer side but
1147.12,4.08,when you think of you know the space of
1149.12,3.76,textiles and really the broad space in
1151.2,3.12,general it's really about the people
1152.88,2.64,that are working in it
1154.32,3.2,and the impact that it has on the
1155.52,3.6,environment in the case of textiles you
1157.52,4.24,know there's a huge environment impact
1159.12,4.72,impact on the type of textiles we use
1161.76,3.68,the waste how it's manufactured now
1163.84,2.8,you're adding an element of intelligence
1165.44,2.32,right now there's hardware there's
1166.64,3.039,software involved that does all the
1167.76,3.76,computation so really there's a whole
1169.679,3.521,ecosystem that's involved
1171.52,3.279,in this space and because we're at such
1173.2,3.28,a point now where
1174.799,4.24,everything is really new we can actually
1176.48,3.76,define in design for sustainability in
1179.039,3.52,mind in the space of intelligent
1180.24,3.679,textiles so whether it's the case of you
1182.559,3.201,know the factory worker who's trying to
1183.919,3.201,integrate you know smart textiles at the
1185.76,3.039,apparel level
1187.12,3.36,to the brand that's actually making it
1188.799,4.481,to the end customer as well so we can
1190.48,5.12,design for sustainability in mind which
1193.28,3.519,is one of the really unique uh
1195.6,3.12,really aspects about the space that
1196.799,3.201,we're working in at microsoft research
1198.72,2.88,and so coming back to that analogy i
1200.0,3.44,described earlier with the boat parts
1201.6,4.319,and car parts you know what we're trying
1203.44,4.479,to do today is really emphasize building
1205.919,4.081,out that better boat whether it's better
1207.919,3.441,sensing through the fabrics
1210.0,3.36,sustainable fabrics that are also
1211.36,3.36,intelligent to designing better back-end
1213.36,3.36,systems that take into account the
1214.72,3.68,environmental impact it's really all
1216.72,3.28,about the ecosystem
1218.4,2.96,in moving forward in this ocean and that
1220.0,3.28,is one of the things i'm really excited
1221.36,3.6,about here at microsoft research
1223.28,3.12,so obviously this insane vision we have
1224.96,2.959,here at microsoft research is not just
1226.4,3.279,myself but it's a whole team of us at
1227.919,3.921,the future of wearables lab
1229.679,3.761,first off it's led by evelina barhudaran
1231.84,2.8,who is a co-innovator as well as a
1233.44,3.359,leader of business development and
1234.64,3.76,strategy for myself and the team
1236.799,2.641,as well as becky gangnon and gabrielle
1238.4,3.68,demon who handle a lot of the
1239.44,4.16,engineering as well as industrial design
1242.08,3.12,as well i have some amazing academic
1243.6,3.36,collaborators taehyun wu who's a phd
1245.2,3.2,student at dartmouth college as well as
1246.96,3.52,a supervisor and a colleague of mine and
1248.4,3.84,close friend dr zhing dong yang also at
1250.48,2.88,dartmouth college i also wanted to give
1252.24,2.799,a quick shout out to the microsoft
1253.36,3.28,research hardware lab who does amazing
1255.039,3.441,amazing work here moving this vision
1256.64,3.12,forward so before i leave you today i
1258.48,2.96,kind of want to leave you with a nice
1259.76,3.279,quote from walter benjamin was a
1261.44,4.08,personal favorite of mine
1263.039,4.88,work on good pros has three steps a
1265.52,4.72,musical stage when it is composed
1267.919,4.481,an architronic one one is built and
1270.24,4.08,textile one when it is woven
1272.4,3.6,so microsoft research we're composing a
1274.32,2.96,lot of the components you've seen today
1276.0,2.159,you know we're trying to make that boat
1277.28,2.0,better
1278.159,3.041,we're building all the necessary
1279.28,3.36,software and infrastructure for it
1281.2,2.8,but really what it comes down to
1282.64,2.96,especially you as the audience and
1284.0,2.64,looking for collaborators as well is
1285.6,2.64,weaving this all together through
1286.64,3.919,textiles so if you're someone who's
1288.24,5.04,interested in smart textiles connected
1290.559,4.081,experiences through you know jerseys or
1293.28,2.399,areas like that
1294.64,2.72,or even really just interested in
1295.679,2.641,wearables in general please get in touch
1297.36,2.4,and let's collaborate because that's
1298.32,2.64,really what we're all about at microsoft
1299.76,3.08,research
1300.96,4.32,up next you're going to meet anne
1302.84,3.959,paradiso anne is a principal research
1305.28,3.68,designer in the enable group here at
1306.799,3.921,microsoft research and she works to pair
1308.96,4.079,human-centered design and technology to
1310.72,4.319,enable expression and creativity the
1313.039,3.281,enable group creates technologies that
1315.039,2.561,improve the lives of people with
1316.32,3.12,disabilities
1317.6,3.6,community is one important aspect to the
1319.44,5.599,group's work so they design new
1321.2,6.479,technology with users not just for users
1325.039,5.76,i'm ann paradiso and i am a research
1327.679,5.041,designer at msr and i'm sitting here in
1330.799,3.681,the enable lab in
1332.72,3.439,redmond one of the things that i care
1334.48,5.199,deeply about and that i know all of my
1336.159,5.441,collaborators care deeply about is
1339.679,3.761,that gap between what happens in a
1341.6,5.36,research lab or in
1343.44,5.68,this lab or in a development environment
1346.96,4.32,and getting technologies that are
1349.12,4.08,critical into the hands of users who can
1351.28,3.68,use them and benefit from them we have
1353.2,5.04,several collaborators inside of
1354.96,5.44,microsoft who have different skill sets
1358.24,5.52,that when we combine them together we
1360.4,4.759,find we can be more effective as a team
1363.76,3.84,expressive pixels is a
1365.159,3.88,technology-mediated creativity toolkit
1367.6,3.6,it's the result of a long-standing
1369.039,4.88,collaboration among the enable group and
1371.2,4.4,central engineering teams at msr redmond
1373.919,3.521,and the microsoft small medium and
1375.6,3.28,corporate business team the platform
1377.44,3.2,embodies our shared belief that
1378.88,3.679,expression through technology art and
1380.64,3.519,communication should be an empowering
1382.559,3.201,experience for all
1384.159,3.76,expressive pixels can be paired with a
1385.76,4.399,variety of inclusive inputs and led
1387.919,4.0,displays to enable all sorts of novel
1390.159,3.681,alternative avenues for creative
1391.919,3.76,expression and communication here's a
1393.84,4.8,short introduction to the platform by
1395.679,5.201,expressive pixels co-creator gavin janke
1398.64,4.88,hi i'm gavin and i'm excited to share
1400.88,4.799,with you microsoft expressive pixels
1403.52,4.24,a fun new app that provides an inclusive
1405.679,3.36,experience for people with all abilities
1407.76,4.88,to express
1409.039,3.601,connect and share with others
1413.52,4.24,expressive pixels originally came about
1415.84,3.28,from a desire to provide a means of
1417.76,3.6,expression
1419.12,3.6,for some people verbal expressions may
1421.36,3.6,be challenging
1422.72,3.92,whether because of speech disabilities

1494.96,3.28,human and organization on the planet to
1497.12,3.28,achieve more
1498.24,4.72,so that word every
1500.4,4.0,is really where we focus that means
1502.96,3.199,every human
1504.4,2.72,not
1506.159,3.441,e
1507.12,3.919,not just humans who don't have hard
1509.6,3.28,problems to solve
1511.039,3.441,when you build relationships
1512.88,4.799,uh like we do with our creative
1514.48,5.679,collaborators and with our our community
1517.679,4.24,you're invested you're deeply deeply
1520.159,4.0,invested in their well-being as your
1521.919,4.961,friend your collaborator and your fellow
1524.159,5.601,human being and so that sense of
1526.88,4.159,investment purpose and empathy is what
1529.76,4.399,keeps
1531.039,5.76,everybody that's the glue that sense of
1534.159,4.561,of purpose that sense of common purpose
1536.799,4.801,is the connective tissue
1538.72,5.12,for all of us working in the space
1541.6,4.8,music is a primitive and powerful means
1543.84,4.16,of human communication and expression
1546.4,3.6,through it we can share emotions
1548.0,4.159,experiences and meanings with people
1550.0,3.44,across cultures and languages and even
1552.159,2.64,across time
1553.44,2.719,for the last five years we've been
1554.799,3.521,experimenting with a number of
1556.159,3.921,approaches to inclusive music in support
1558.32,4.0,of people with little to no motor
1560.08,3.92,ability who may also be experiencing
1562.32,3.28,speech loss
1564.0,4.24,the projects i'm going to show you next
1565.6,4.72,share one primary input constraint they
1568.24,3.2,have to be able to be played using just
1570.32,4.08,the eyes
1571.44,4.96,that is no speech no other movement the
1574.4,4.56,hands-free music project is an ongoing
1576.4,5.12,collaboration between microsoft local
1578.96,4.24,musicians and the als community
1581.52,3.36,it includes a suite of eye-controlled
1583.2,4.079,instruments and playing interfaces to
1584.88,4.24,support composition performance and live

1602.08,6.0,diagnosed with als
1604.72,6.16,uh obviously a lot of negatives here
1608.08,5.76,um but it's been very interesting
1610.88,2.96,to see
1614.0,5.96,some amazing things occur
1616.559,3.401,in the aftermath

1665.84,3.839,the cyclops is an eye instrument
1667.84,3.68,designed by music technologist willie
1669.679,4.321,payne during his summer internship with
1671.52,4.24,the enable experiences group here in msr
1674.0,4.08,willie built the cyclops to support
1675.76,4.639,improvisation and performance scenarios
1678.08,5.199,for musicians who only have control over
1680.399,5.361,their eyes and yes willie is doing his
1683.279,5.201,entire demo using just his eyes the
1685.76,6.88,cyclops has three main screens
1688.48,6.799,instrument sequence and audio effects
1692.64,4.88,the instrument page is the primary page
1695.279,4.961,for producing sounds
1697.52,5.44,tiny red dot is where the eye tracker
1700.24,5.039,detects my eye gaze
1702.96,5.12,when i stare long enough at a button on
1705.279,6.0,the screen it will cause it to press
1708.08,5.92,playing a sound
1711.279,4.88,the sequence tab contains extra controls
1714.0,4.64,for playing with the loop
1716.159,5.601,we can change the tempo to affect the
1718.64,3.12,speed of the music
1723.279,5.681,we can add accents to increase the
1725.52,6.96,volume of individual notes or rests to
1728.96,3.52,silence portions of the loop
1735.279,4.721,on the effects page
1736.96,5.439,we can fine tune how our sound actually
1740.0,2.399,sounds
1742.88,4.64,with just a few controls
1744.96,5.68,the cyclops is an expressive instrument
1747.52,5.2,capable of a wide range of sounds
1750.64,4.56,all controlled and triggered just with
1752.72,2.48,your eyes
1760.159,3.601,to me one of the best ways to learn is
1762.72,4.959,to do
1763.76,6.72,and the way that you learn uh how you
1767.679,5.36,can best serve a user community
1770.48,4.799,who is facing profound constraints due
1773.039,3.441,to ability loss because of disease
1775.279,2.4,progression
1776.48,2.24,is to
1777.679,3.521,meet them
1778.72,4.48,listen to them observe them
1781.2,3.92,and you know take part in as many
1783.2,4.8,activities as we can because
1785.12,4.32,experiential observation is super
1788.0,3.12,critical especially when you're trying
1789.44,2.56,to decide we're going to focus your
1791.12,3.52,efforts
1792.0,5.039,our space in general um we do a
1794.64,4.08,combination of things we do formal
1797.039,4.0,fundamental research
1798.72,4.72,in computer science write papers conduct
1801.039,5.36,studies create prototypes proofs of
1803.44,5.04,concepts evaluate them and release those
1806.399,4.88,findings into the world so that we can
1808.48,4.16,better inform the design of assistive
1811.279,2.321,and expressive technologies in the
1812.64,4.08,future
1813.6,6.079,we also incubate our own designs and
1816.72,5.04,technologies and we work iteratively and
1819.679,5.201,collaboratively with our user community
1821.76,4.88,to direct those activities we
1824.88,3.84,are honest about what we learn we put
1826.64,3.919,everything out
1828.72,2.959,in the open source or in the public
1830.559,2.401,domain
1831.679,4.961,we share
1832.96,5.839,we mentor students we mentor talent we
1836.64,3.84,we do all of those activities because
1838.799,2.88,that is how the progress is going to
1840.48,3.84,happen
1841.679,3.761,what way can we use technology in
1844.32,5.599,service
1845.44,7.599,to our goal of restoring or reinventing
1849.919,6.24,lost capability if you don't center your
1853.039,5.681,user community in every single activity
1856.159,4.721,every single research design
1858.72,5.839,or development or innovation activity
1860.88,5.919,that you have you will not be successful
1864.559,3.921,finally we'll hear from ken hinckley a
1866.799,3.12,senior principal researcher who's also
1868.48,3.039,from the epic group
1869.919,3.281,ken is going to talk with us about how
1871.519,3.921,devices can help to make sense out of
1873.2,4.319,our increasingly complex work lives and
1875.44,3.92,interactions with others he's worked on
1877.519,4.321,everything from sensing techniques
1879.36,4.799,cross-device interaction to novel device
1881.84,4.4,form factors today he's going to tell
1884.159,3.841,you a little bit about surface fleet
1886.24,3.52,this technology has implications for
1888.0,4.799,something many of us can relate to these
1889.76,5.279,days the home workspace
1892.799,3.76,i'm ken hinckley i work here at the lab
1895.039,3.441,microsoft research
1896.559,3.681,we innovate across hardware software and
1898.48,3.439,the human experience
1900.24,3.439,we do all kinds of cool research in
1901.919,4.321,terms of interaction with devices and
1903.679,4.401,also studying how people use devices and
1906.24,4.0,also interact with one another
1908.08,4.64,sweet study collaboration we study how
1910.24,4.159,people do you know work in productivity
1912.72,3.12,uh we study how they actually use their
1914.399,3.441,devices in terms of just picking things
1915.84,3.439,up looking at them moving them around
1917.84,3.439,all this kind of stuff so we have lots
1919.279,3.601,of you know very fun things that we do
1921.279,3.52,one of the you know exciting areas that
1922.88,3.36,we work in a lot is you know sort of
1924.799,3.281,figuring out how to leverage smarts
1926.24,3.76,about the world around us so bringing in
1928.08,4.88,things like sensors or you know sort of
1930.0,4.48,unusual inputs like speech or gaze or
1932.96,3.52,you know camera inputs that kind of
1934.48,4.24,thing to have a more natural way of
1936.48,3.679,working with our devices the actual name
1938.72,3.52,epic is an acronym right so it stands
1940.159,3.281,for extended perception interaction and
1942.24,3.039,cognition
1943.44,3.28,so we work across all these topics so
1945.279,2.961,the perception is the human perception
1946.72,3.92,of how they see the world how they feel
1948.24,3.84,the world how they hear the world
1950.64,2.72,the interaction of course is you know
1952.08,2.719,interacting with things around you
1953.36,3.12,moving things like even just a simple
1954.799,3.6,mouse or picking up a device that's an
1956.48,3.039,interaction looking at someone that's an
1958.399,3.12,interaction you might not think of it
1959.519,3.841,that way but if our computers and
1961.519,3.681,devices can sense these things and
1963.36,3.199,respond to them appropriately
1965.2,2.8,it makes it so they can be much smarter
1966.559,3.281,about how they interpret you know what
1968.0,4.0,we're doing in the world um and then the
1969.84,3.52,cognition part is ties into you know not
1972.0,2.559,so much artificial intelligence but
1973.36,3.679,actual human you know genuine
1974.559,4.96,intelligence right and how people think
1977.039,3.841,about you know the world their tasks um
1979.519,3.76,how they think about interacting with
1980.88,3.919,one another uh and a lot of this is it's
1983.279,4.0,not just in your brain but it's actually
1984.799,3.841,externalized to the world so it um you
1987.279,3.201,know the so the e and epic stands for
1988.64,3.519,the you know this externalization or
1990.48,3.12,this extended nature of intelligence
1992.159,3.36,where your artifacts in the world
1993.6,3.439,actually encode information and you so
1995.519,2.721,you don't have to remember something you
1997.039,2.721,stick it on a post-it note and you stick
1998.24,3.439,it on your monitor and that's you know
1999.76,3.36,externalizing that reminder
2001.679,3.6,so that that's sort of the whole scope
2003.12,3.76,of the research in the group um so for
2005.279,3.041,example we do you know we've contributed
2006.88,2.799,to the new future work in terms of
2008.32,2.719,studying like what people do with their
2009.679,2.801,devices while they're working at home
2011.039,2.88,what kind of tasks are they doing how
2012.48,3.12,are they dougling tasks with their kids
2013.919,4.24,and their families and their
2015.6,4.0,multiple clients and all these things we
2018.159,3.201,work across
2019.6,3.199,things like you know haptic feedback for
2021.36,3.52,example so devices that can actually
2022.799,3.6,respond to you with you can feel
2024.88,2.48,tactilely you know what's going on in
2026.399,2.0,terms of
2027.36,2.559,you know if you're interacting with
2028.399,3.441,virtual reality you can feel objects in
2029.919,3.441,the world you can feel the shape of
2031.84,3.439,things maybe if you're not if you're a
2033.36,3.919,person who's not sighted
2035.279,4.0,so we do all kinds of things along those
2037.279,3.601,lines so we're kind of hurtling towards
2039.279,3.12,this future where everyone has these
2040.88,3.279,multiple screens and multiple devices
2042.399,2.88,all around them and this is a trend
2044.159,2.64,that's been particularly you know
2045.279,3.36,aggravated by this you know new future
2046.799,3.441,of work that we find ourselves in uh
2048.639,3.04,where suddenly we're working at home you
2050.24,2.96,know you've got your screen there maybe
2051.679,3.92,you've got your kids ipad there you know
2053.2,4.479,maybe you've got another computer at the
2055.599,3.841,at the ready um and you're you're just
2057.679,3.121,trying to get your work done across all
2059.44,3.6,these devices
2060.8,3.839,and so it's not unlike how people might
2063.04,3.44,work you know in an office space where
2064.639,3.601,they're spreading out uh information
2066.48,2.879,across multiple pieces of paper they're
2068.24,2.399,trying to you know lay out their
2069.359,3.28,thoughts you know organize things and
2070.639,4.561,kind of this informal way of putting
2072.639,4.641,things in space and so multiple devices
2075.2,3.919,can serve this same role so in a sense
2077.28,2.879,people you know they like to use space
2079.119,2.8,to think
2080.159,3.601,so we like to think of ways to do that
2081.919,3.361,in the digital world as well the main
2083.76,3.839,idea of surface lead is to make it easy
2085.28,3.92,to work across these multiple devices
2087.599,3.04,and sort of the objective is to make it
2089.2,2.639,easy to transition you know whatever
2090.639,3.921,activity you're working on from one
2091.839,4.161,device to another or from one location
2094.56,3.519,to another or even to pass it off to
2096.0,3.359,another person or to defer it to a
2098.079,2.401,future time when you're actually ready
2099.359,2.881,to work on it
2100.48,3.52,so having both technologies and user
2102.24,2.96,experiences that speak to that
2104.0,3.68,is something that we're looking at very
2105.2,4.0,closely um so in particular today i can
2107.68,3.36,talk a bit about something we're doing
2109.2,3.36,called the ultimate flexible workspace
2111.04,3.12,which is a device concept we've been
2112.56,4.24,exploring which makes us you can just
2114.16,4.72,walk up to your your your workstation at
2116.8,3.44,home uh with your tablet you just plop
2118.88,3.12,it into this armature that's kind of
2120.24,3.359,like an articulated lamp and then you
2122.0,2.72,can kind of posture your tablet anywhere
2123.599,2.321,in space
2124.72,2.879,and then the really cool thing is when
2125.92,3.199,you have multiple of these they're all
2127.599,3.201,aware of one another you can sort of
2129.119,3.681,juxtapose them you can split them apart
2130.8,3.6,you can put one down one up
2132.8,2.64,so you know just depending on your task
2134.4,2.48,and what you're trying to do and what
2135.44,3.6,information you want to see side by side
2136.88,4.239,it makes it super easy to dynamically
2139.04,3.76,create these formations of devices
2141.119,2.72,because it also senses these transitions
2142.8,2.319,all you have to do is put the device
2143.839,2.801,next to another one and it says like hey
2145.119,2.881,you want your document here and then you
2146.64,3.04,can just drag it over or you know
2148.0,3.119,whatever you want to do so it it makes
2149.68,3.04,it really easy to work in these kind of
2151.119,3.601,ad hoc workspaces that we have in our
2152.72,4.16,homes where often you know space is very
2154.72,3.6,limited uh you might have multiple
2156.88,3.52,screens but you're just you're kind of
2158.32,3.68,in this little you know sort of
2160.4,3.679,improvised desks in the corner of your
2162.0,3.359,living room somewhere right so uh making
2164.079,3.04,it really easy to work in those kind of
2165.359,3.281,spaces which you know also can translate
2167.119,3.841,to the future when we get back to the
2168.64,4.24,office and we're sharing spaces and
2170.96,4.639,conference rooms and so forth
2172.88,4.16,so in particular um last year which is
2175.599,3.201,actually during this you know pandemic
2177.04,3.84,remote work time we had a visiting
2178.8,3.52,researcher by the name of nick marquart
2180.88,3.52,uh who's a professor at universe
2182.32,3.6,university college london uh also
2184.4,3.52,happens to be a former intern who worked
2185.92,3.6,with me you know over 10 years ago now
2187.92,2.8,um and so nick and i have sort of done a
2189.52,2.8,number of projects over the year and he
2190.72,3.52,had this brainstorm about you know
2192.32,4.48,basically repurposing articulated lamps
2194.24,4.72,as a smart uh appliance you know desk
2196.8,4.64,appliance for the for the work at home
2198.96,3.76,situation um so the idea is that you
2201.44,3.2,basically take you know we literally
2202.72,4.399,ordered these armatures off of amazon i
2204.64,4.16,think right so they're like 20 bucks uh
2207.119,2.96,just added some sensors to them which
2208.8,2.799,are just you know they're basically just
2210.079,2.801,simple motion sensors it's the same as
2211.599,3.841,you would have in your smartphone or
2212.88,4.16,tablet already put a bunch of those on
2215.44,3.919,you know the different
2217.04,3.92,armature links there and then we can
2219.359,3.921,actually sense where the tablet is in
2220.96,4.0,space so as you you know position it you
2223.28,3.839,can let go of it it just stays there it
2224.96,4.159,knows its angle it knows its position is
2227.119,3.281,notice how it's postured relative to you
2229.119,3.441,you can put it over next to another
2230.4,4.0,device if that one also has an armature
2232.56,3.6,then that one also can know where it is
2234.4,3.52,relative to the other so they have this
2236.16,3.12,kind of spatial sense of like who's
2237.92,2.96,nearby just like you would be aware of
2239.28,3.52,if someone walked up behind you or next
2240.88,3.68,to you you collaborate with them so in
2242.8,3.2,that in that sense your devices are
2244.56,3.44,spatially aware they're aware of one
2246.0,3.76,another and they can present these
2248.0,4.24,opportunities to just easily move
2249.76,4.16,documents or pieces of work or to take
2252.24,4.32,the input or camera from one device and
2253.92,3.84,kind of access it on another so it makes
2256.56,3.36,it really easy to work in the sort of
2257.76,3.839,multi-device multi-screen future that we
2259.92,3.28,see ourselves moving towards in terms of
2261.599,2.801,technology trends as well as the
2263.2,2.639,experiences that people want to have
2264.4,3.199,with all these different screens in
2265.839,3.28,their lives
2267.599,2.881,right so when people are you know in
2269.119,3.441,these spaces where they're working
2270.48,3.92,across their digital content often we
2272.56,3.2,have these very you know complex sort of
2274.4,2.719,knowledge work type tasks we're doing
2275.76,3.839,where there's you're trying to get
2277.119,3.921,insights from across multiple documents
2279.599,3.201,across different sites on the web so
2281.04,3.36,you're trying to bring these together
2282.8,3.12,into new artifacts that you're creating
2284.4,4.56,for you know here's my idea here's my
2285.92,5.199,report is my presentation um so and this
2288.96,4.32,is you know it's cognitively demanding
2291.119,3.841,work so just being limited to one little
2293.28,3.92,screen to do that is just doesn't work
2294.96,4.08,so well and particularly people we find
2297.2,3.84,more and more are co-opting device other
2299.04,4.0,devices they already have into this so
2301.04,4.24,and and it goes beyond just um you know
2303.04,4.16,documents so for example if i'm in a
2305.28,4.079,teleconference call i might want to have
2307.2,3.76,the document up on one screen i might
2309.359,2.801,put the camera on my mobile phone which
2310.96,2.8,is somewhere else so it gets the right
2312.16,3.36,camera angle i can still see the content
2313.76,3.839,that i'm talking about and i can divide
2315.52,3.68,that across multiple devices you know or
2317.599,3.281,say someone sends me a you know a
2319.2,2.879,contract to sign right i don't want to
2320.88,2.64,take that and try to sign it on a big
2322.079,3.28,monitor i want to take that put it on my
2323.52,3.28,tablet i use the pen there to hand write
2325.359,3.201,it or annotate the document for
2326.8,2.96,something more or maybe i sketch up an
2328.56,2.799,idea there and then i want to get it
2329.76,2.4,back onto my big screen to do the work
2331.359,2.081,there
2332.16,3.6,so people like being able to extend
2333.44,4.159,their workspaces mix and match sort of
2335.76,3.04,the the best of each device that they
2337.599,3.601,have so they kind of leverage those
2338.8,3.68,strengths and use their multiple screens
2341.2,2.72,and multiple devices with all these
2342.48,3.44,different capabilities to compliment one
2343.92,3.199,another to kind of get more work done
2345.92,2.64,think more clearly about what they're
2347.119,4.441,doing and just kind of have that great
2348.56,3.0,idea
