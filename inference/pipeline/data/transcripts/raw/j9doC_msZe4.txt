0.0,3.72,hi it's Anastasia and welcome to my
1.89,3.27,channel today I want to talk to you
3.72,3.15,about what programming language you
5.16,3.3,should learn if you want to get involved
6.87,3.18,in quantum computing I'm going to
8.46,3.21,introduce you to some of these quantum
10.05,3.36,computing frameworks and packages that
11.67,3.03,are out there and give you all the
13.41,2.879,resources that you need to get you
14.7,3.659,started on coding on real quantum
16.289,4.08,computers today and yes quantum
18.359,3.601,computers do exist they were actually
20.369,3.721,out there they're for real that's a
21.96,3.809,question I get asked a lot and you can
24.09,3.99,code and with some of these packages on
25.769,3.93,real quantum chips synthesis do tend to
28.08,3.63,code in a lot of different programming
29.699,5.341,languages so for example I've done work
31.71,5.97,at C C++ even Fortran so I graduated
35.04,4.41,college in 2012 and I actually still
37.68,4.469,used for trams the supercomputer
39.45,3.12,upstairs would only take that but don't
42.149,1.831,worry
42.57,3.21,quantum computing has come to a more
43.98,3.36,modern age so if you want to learn
45.78,2.88,coding and get involved in quantum
47.34,4.109,computing what programming language
48.66,4.77,should you study my recommendation is
51.449,4.051,for you to learn Python and I know you
53.43,3.899,hear that a lot but hear me out there's
55.5,3.42,three major reasons why you should learn
57.329,3.601,Python if you want to get involved in
58.92,3.81,quantum computing it's easy to learn
60.93,3.6,there's a ton of resources out there and
62.73,3.9,a lot of quantum computing frameworks
64.53,3.33,are written for Python now I know
66.63,2.58,there's a lot of awesome quantum
67.86,3.57,computing languages out there that are
69.21,3.93,not based on Python there's Q sharp
71.43,3.57,which is Microsoft's quantum programming
73.14,3.6,language based on c-sharp and they're
75.0,3.57,silk which is this new programming
76.74,3.66,language out of ETH Zurich which looks
78.57,3.659,really cool but I want to cover those in
80.4,3.12,another video so if you're new to
82.229,2.911,programming and eventually want to get
83.52,3.09,involved with quantum computing these
85.14,4.019,are the reasons that I think you should
86.61,4.649,learn Python so number one it's simple
89.159,3.871,syntax and easy to learn Python is
91.259,3.271,beginner friendly even if you're new to
93.03,3.36,programming and haven't touched code
94.53,3.81,before Python is almost written like a
96.39,4.29,sentence so you can almost intuitively
98.34,4.319,feel like what it's supposed to do and
100.68,3.509,Python is basically everywhere for
102.659,2.971,example the Mac OS comes with it
104.189,3.18,pre-installed so you don't even have to
105.63,4.019,install anything or do any complicated
107.369,4.53,setup to get started with Python you can
109.649,4.321,do so many things with Python I've used
111.899,4.231,it for web apps web scrapers automate
113.97,4.71,some boring stuff to save me time so
116.13,4.559,it's a pretty amazing language in fact
118.68,3.539,according to stack overflow Python is
120.689,3.901,now the most popular programming
122.219,4.171,language overtaking Java and JavaScript
124.59,4.83,so definitely a great thing to learn
126.39,5.55,number two lots of resources out there
129.42,4.23,like I mentioned you can use Python for
131.94,4.079,scripting web development a
133.65,4.32,and now quantum computing because people
136.019,3.78,use it for so many things there are so
137.97,3.72,many resources out there so you can
139.799,4.5,learn from books YouTube videos or
141.69,4.5,interactive coding tutorials and because
144.299,3.031,python is beginner friendly and a lot of
146.19,3.03,people learn it as their first
147.33,4.17,programming language it'll introduce you
149.22,3.299,to all these broader coding concepts so
151.5,3.03,don't worry if you don't know anything
152.519,4.171,about for loops or recursion it'll
154.53,3.929,usually be covered in these resources so
156.69,3.24,down below in the description I've
158.459,3.271,linked a bunch of my favorite Python
159.93,3.869,learning resources my favorite online
161.73,3.99,courses dr. chucks Python for everybody
163.799,3.841,I really love it because it not only
165.72,3.96,introduces you to Python thinking but
167.64,3.9,also introduce you to mathematical and
169.68,3.36,computational thinking if you're more of
171.54,4.199,a book reader here are two books I'd
173.04,4.38,recommend for learning about Python the
175.739,3.72,first one is called learn Python the
177.42,3.72,hard way and it's been updated for
179.459,3.271,Python 3 and it's one of the first
181.14,3.269,programming books I've ever picked up
182.73,4.02,the other one that I heard great things
184.409,4.44,about is Python crash course for those
186.75,3.81,who'd like to do more YouTube videos and
188.849,3.601,learning coding from there free code
190.56,4.23,camp has a four-and-a-half-hour youtube
192.45,3.929,tutorial so just make sure to break it
194.79,3.87,up into little chunks and make a study
196.379,3.631,plan to get through it and finally if
198.66,3.84,you learn better through interactive
200.01,4.62,coding tutorials Python orgs learning
202.5,3.69,tutorials are amazing and number three
204.63,3.63,the most important reason why you should
206.19,4.62,learn Python is because there's so many
208.26,5.009,Python frameworks for quantum computing
210.81,4.019,a few years ago if you wanted to code on
213.269,3.991,a quantum computer it meant that you had
214.829,4.59,to be a researcher in a secret lab or in
217.26,3.809,graduate school to get access to one now
219.419,3.361,that's not true anymore quantum
221.069,3.48,computers exist in their cloud systems
222.78,4.079,let's let you log in and run code on a
224.549,4.47,real quantum computer companies are now
226.859,3.96,making quantum computers this is really
229.019,3.271,opened up the opportunity for anyone who
230.819,3.51,wants to try the running code on a
232.29,3.659,quantum computer to do it a lot of these
234.329,3.511,packages are also open source and
235.949,3.271,welcome contributions from anyone so you
237.84,3.63,can really get started right now with
239.22,3.269,programming for quantum computers while
241.47,2.609,there are more quantum computing
242.489,3.78,frameworks than just these that I'm
244.079,4.05,gonna talk about some of them are kind
246.269,3.06,of close source or not available to
248.129,3.301,anyone unless you're part of a
249.329,3.331,university or a group so I really wanted
251.43,3.54,to focus on the ones where you don't
252.66,4.65,need any special access so let's talk
254.97,3.989,about cirque Circus Google's library for
257.31,3.929,writing manipulating and simulating
258.959,3.751,quantum circuits currently you can't run
261.239,3.151,any of these circuits on Google's
262.71,3.57,quantum computing chips but they have
264.39,2.94,said that'll make it available soon so
266.28,3.09,cross your fingers
267.33,3.6,another really cool thing about Google
269.37,3.6,is that the team at X has released
270.93,3.329,tensorflow quantum this is really
272.97,2.49,awesome because there's a ton of people
274.259,3.241,there working on quantum machine
275.46,3.63,learning tens our little quantum works
277.5,3.27,with quantum data and working with both
279.09,3.63,classical machine learning models and
280.77,3.81,quantum models together to start
282.72,3.27,learning about tensorflow quantum go to
284.58,3.119,their website because there's a ton of
285.99,3.0,code and learning samples and jupiter
287.699,3.601,notebooks that you can play around with
288.99,4.709,to learn more about the system another
291.3,4.23,framework is called kiss kit kiss kit is
293.699,3.481,IBM software development package for
295.53,3.479,working with noisy quantum computers at
297.18,3.66,all different levels they have 4
299.009,4.47,different modules to use called Terra
300.84,4.049,err Ignace and aqua used for working
303.479,3.301,with quantum computers from the circuit
304.889,4.141,and the pulse level all the way up to
306.78,4.379,the optimized algorithms level Terra has
309.03,4.289,the low-level elements so for example
311.159,4.861,the circuits and the pulses air is a
313.319,3.961,simulator and the noise models eNOS is
316.02,3.389,really used for mitigation of those
317.28,4.08,noise models and aqua is used for higher
319.409,3.81,level quantum algorithms you can run
321.36,3.57,these on IBM's real quantum chips in the
323.219,3.391,cloud iBM has also released an open
324.93,3.419,source textbook with basic quantum
326.61,3.48,computing concepts and how to use kiss
328.349,3.421,kit they also have a ton of tutorials
330.09,3.689,and Jupiter notebooks that are already
331.77,4.44,set up with example code and concepts so
333.779,4.531,you can run code very quickly motion is
336.21,4.35,D waves tool you can use ocean to
338.31,4.32,connect 2d ways leap platform and run
340.56,4.259,code on their simulators or D waves
342.63,3.569,actual machines do you wave is a quantum
344.819,3.361,annealer so it's a little bit different
346.199,4.321,from the other two this type of machine
348.18,3.69,is great for optimization problems where
350.52,3.299,you need to quickly search over the
351.87,4.079,space and find a minimum or a solution
353.819,4.38,to a problem the webinar series has a
355.949,4.261,super-fun tutorial in choosing a Pokemon
358.199,4.47,team using Q Bo which is quantum
360.21,3.78,unconstrained binary optimization which
362.669,3.03,is a common algorithm and machine
363.99,3.84,learning so you can use a quantum
365.699,3.301,computer to choose the best Pokemon team
367.83,3.299,beyond that there's just so many
369.0,3.84,packages and tool boxes out there for
371.129,4.26,Python to make working with quantum
372.84,4.71,computers way easier for example a q-tip
375.389,4.53,or project you also a company called
377.55,3.75,Xanadu has released Penny Lane which is
379.919,2.881,a Python library for quantum machine
381.3,3.119,learning that connects to a bunch of
382.8,3.78,different cloud platforms and helps you
384.419,3.72,run quantum code on real computers so
386.58,2.85,python is a great programming language
388.139,3.09,to learn if you're interested in working
389.43,3.239,with quantum computers one day it's also
391.229,3.481,a generally good programming language to
392.669,3.72,have in your skill set a bunch of
394.71,2.879,companies are hiring Python programmers
396.389,3.06,and it's one of the fastest growing
397.589,3.211,languages out there so whether you're
399.449,3.15,just starting out in computer science
400.8,3.45,you're an experienced programmer there's
402.599,3.151,a chance for anyone at any level to
404.25,2.97,become involved with quantum computing
405.75,3.12,today so I've included a bunch of
407.22,3.21,resources below all the ones I've talked
408.87,3.269,about the different webinars and
410.43,3.63,tutorials that I've talked about in this
412.139,3.84,video click the description they'll all
414.06,3.3,be in there so I hope you enjoyed this
415.979,3.03,video and I hope you found some
417.36,2.85,interesting new resources and are
419.009,3.391,considering getting into quantum
420.21,3.84,computing programming so if you did I'd
