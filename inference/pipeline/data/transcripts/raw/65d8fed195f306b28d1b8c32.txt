SCOTT AARONSON: Well, I wanted to create my own video games,
originally, as a kid.
So, my advisor had a saying, "If you've never a missed a flight
you're spending too much time in airports." It applies more
generally as well.
Probably, like poking holes in a – in a tank for some lizards,
pet lizards that we bought and checking that indeed, if it's
ten holes this way and seven holes this way, then it
invariably is going to be 70 holes in total.
The biggest thing that most people don't realize so much is
the travel, right, the fact that you really get to see the world
just going to different conferences.
Having good ideas.
Well, I think they illuminate what can and can't be done in
computation according to the laws of physics, which if you
care about that sort of thing and a lot of people seem to,
then hopefully it's of interest to you.
Well, at the sort of level of the historic greats, I would
say, Alan Turing. At the level of people who I personally got
to know, I would say Umesh Vazirani, my advisor at
Berkeley. He had this saying, to concentrate on the high order
bits, right, just concentrate on the important stuff. Don't
worry about the trivial stuff and he really sort of showed
that by example.
What would surprise people is just how little in Theoretical
Computer Science we actually rely on computers. We use them
to check e-mail and do word processing pretty much
like anyone else.
Myself, probably. [Aside from yourself] Oh, aside from myself,
I guess, my computer is probably the most expensive thing there.
No, I don't play music. Nah, if it's – if it's ambience then
I'll enjoy listening to it but I'm happy to just hear the
sounds of the street.
