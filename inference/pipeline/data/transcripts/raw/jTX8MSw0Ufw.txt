14.639,4.921,developing highly intellectual robots
16.82,5.44,technology has been evolving in almost
19.56,4.799,all possible Fields providing various
22.26,3.72,job opportunities that are continuously
24.359,4.141,growing day by day
25.98,4.559,in this video let's discuss some of the
28.5,4.739,best Technologies for the coming year
30.539,4.981,Yes you heard it right we will focus on
33.239,3.541,the top 10 Technologies to learn for
35.52,2.879,2023
36.78,3.959,stick to the end of the video to know
38.399,5.34,which is the most trending technology of
40.739,4.5,2023 but before we begin consider
43.739,4.021,subscribing to our Channel simply learn
45.239,5.82,and hit the Bell icon to never miss any
47.76,5.76,updates so if you are a tech geek here's
51.059,4.5,a question for you what was the first
53.52,4.58,digitally operated and programmable
55.559,7.261,robot called here are the options
58.1,6.16,unicorn unimate unifac and yeah let us
62.82,4.56,know your answer in the comment section
64.26,5.039,below so without any further delay let's
67.38,3.599,check the technology which is at number
69.299,6.0,10 on our list
70.979,6.541,10 extended reality extended reality or
75.299,5.761,XR covers everything that falls under
77.52,7.38,augmented reality AR virtual reality VR
81.06,5.879,mixed reality Mr or anything in between
84.9,4.079,businesses and major industries like

123.659,3.121,to one hundred two thousand dollars
125.64,2.94,annually
126.78,4.259,let's unlock the next technology
128.58,4.14,training at number nine Edge Computing
131.039,4.021,more of architecture rather than
132.72,4.08,technology Edge Computing is a
135.06,3.66,distributed computing pattern that
136.8,4.32,brings data storage and computation
138.72,4.739,closer to the data source thereby
141.12,4.619,improving the response time and saving
143.459,4.201,the bandwidth it's considered an
145.739,5.22,important factor for the success of the
147.66,5.54,5G and iot industries as per reports
150.959,6.021,Edge Computing is estimated to reach

487.699,6.461,24.2 percent at the runner-up position
490.8,5.64,we have proof of work and proof of stake
494.16,4.14,decentralized cryptocurrency networks
496.44,4.259,must ensure that transactions are
498.3,4.86,carried out safely and securely without
500.699,5.701,a centralized organization like Visa or
503.16,4.86,PayPal to accomplish this networks use a
506.4,4.44,technology known as a consensus
508.02,4.92,mechanism proof of work and proof of
510.84,4.079,stake are the two consensus mechanisms
512.94,4.08,that enable all the computers in a
514.919,4.381,crypto Network to concur on which
517.02,4.56,transactions are valid
519.3,6.3,proof of work is the older one of them
521.58,6.6,used by Bitcoin ethereum 1.0 it uses
525.6,4.62,mining by miners around the world and
528.18,4.82,proof of stake is the newer consensus
530.22,6.299,mechanism that powers ethereum 2.0
533.0,5.62,cardano tezos which employs a network of
536.519,4.741,validators to validate the new
538.62,5.219,transaction update the blockchain and
541.26,4.199,earn a reward if to excel in this
543.839,3.841,technology you should have Proficiency
545.459,5.221,in at least one high level programming
547.68,5.339,language a solid grasp of cryptography
550.68,4.38,and security principles knowledge of
553.019,4.32,smart contracts and familiarity with
