0.48,6.24,again welcome to database system cs630
4.16,4.8,introduction to database these lectures
6.72,3.04,cover chapter one of our course sales
8.96,2.48,book
9.76,4.08,our main objective is to go through
11.44,5.839,different types of databases
13.84,5.359,and also database applications the basic
17.279,5.281,definitions
19.199,5.201,also database management functionalities
22.56,4.639,we should also discuss about the main
24.4,6.0,characteristics of database approach
27.199,5.281,and also the advantages
30.4,4.159,so we start with the types of databases
32.48,4.0,and database application
34.559,5.201,normally traditional applications will
36.48,4.56,be numeric and textural databases where
39.76,5.279,we store
41.04,6.4,values and text messages
45.039,5.36,but most recent or more recent
47.44,5.52,applications are multimedia database
50.399,4.561,where we can install media data such as
52.96,4.079,graphics images
54.96,3.599,also we have geographic information
57.039,4.241,system
58.559,4.8,biological and genome database that's
61.28,3.919,mostly in a computational biology
63.359,3.921,bioinformatics
65.199,3.121,data warehouses
67.28,3.839,mobile
68.32,6.24,databases such as our smartphone
71.119,6.801,or any mobile devices tablets etc
74.56,6.239,also real-time and active databases
77.92,5.04,such as a stock market and
80.799,4.401,database system
82.96,4.4,so a numeric and textual database system
85.2,4.72,we see a database
87.36,5.6,that provide numeric information such as
89.92,5.199,statistics or demographic information
92.96,4.56,it's a numeric databases
95.119,3.761,also traditional textual database
97.52,4.08,interfaces
98.88,4.32,allow users to search an index composed
101.6,6.08,of exclusively
103.2,6.8,of terms extracted from documents
107.68,4.799,now a multimedia database is a
110.0,4.56,collection of related
112.479,5.521,for multimedia data
114.56,5.44,so multimedia data can be images or
118.0,4.24,media data types
120.0,5.439,videos etc
122.24,5.199,we also have a mobile databases
125.439,4.24,which is in mobile computing devices
127.439,4.88,such as smartphones
129.679,5.28,and personal digital assistants also
132.319,5.681,store and share data over a mobile
134.959,5.681,network or a database which is actually
138.0,5.28,stored by the mobile device
140.64,4.72,this could be a list of contacts
143.28,3.84,price information
145.36,4.239,distance traveled or any other
147.12,4.24,information
149.599,2.801,we also have geographical information
151.36,4.159,system
152.4,4.24,which is a computer system for capturing
155.519,3.921,storing
156.64,6.48,checking and displaying data related to
159.44,7.68,positions on our health surface
163.12,6.64,now by relating similarly unrelated data
167.12,5.119,gis can help individuals and
169.76,3.6,organizations better understand spatial
172.239,4.0,patterns
173.36,5.68,and also relationships
176.239,5.36,biological and genome databases
179.04,4.96,can be again broadly classified into
181.599,4.0,sequence structure and functional
184.0,4.56,databases
185.599,6.0,so nuclear acid and protein sequences
188.56,6.319,are saw in a sequence databases
191.599,5.241,for example a nucleotide for dna
194.879,5.841,would be the
196.84,6.28,ac and the four nucleotides also protein
200.72,5.92,concepts protein sequence
203.12,5.679,agtc for dna
206.64,5.36,and then we also have
208.799,6.321,the structure normally for protein
212.0,4.799,structure databases to store a 3d
215.12,4.72,structure of a
216.799,4.8,protein or rna
219.84,5.52,then functional data based on what we
221.599,7.36,store the data but let's say the protein
225.36,5.599,functions etc dna function etc now human
228.959,3.601,genomic databases also are referred to
230.959,4.56,as online
232.56,5.36,repository of genomic variants
235.519,3.521,mainly described for a single or more
237.92,3.519,genes
239.04,3.919,or specifically for a population or
241.439,4.241,ethnic group
242.959,3.681,aiming to facilitate diagnosis at dna
245.68,3.52,level
246.64,4.159,and also to correlate genomic variants
249.2,4.0,with specific
250.799,4.8,phenotypic patterns and clinical
253.2,5.279,features
255.599,5.2,a data warehouse normally is where
258.479,3.761,companies or business organizations
260.799,3.921,store
262.24,4.56,historical data for so many years so
264.72,4.8,most business organizations may have a
266.8,5.52,regular database system for transaction
269.52,4.72,or we say transactional database
272.32,3.68,where they may have a policy that okay
274.24,4.32,every month we may
276.0,4.96,transfer our transaction database to our
278.56,5.199,data warehouse so data warehouse we may
280.96,4.88,have historical data for many years
283.759,4.961,and these datas are very good for
285.84,5.6,analytics such as using data mining
288.72,5.199,algorithm or machine learning algorithm
291.44,5.6,to find a knowledge from that database
293.919,5.201,system so a data warehouse again is a
297.04,5.12,type of data management system that is
299.12,5.28,designed to enable and support business
302.16,4.8,intelligence activities
304.4,4.799,especially analytics
306.96,4.079,so data warehouses are solely tended to
309.199,4.241,perform queries
311.039,5.281,and also analysis and often contain
313.44,5.599,large amounts of historical data
316.32,5.04,the data within a data warehouse is
319.039,3.6,usually derived from a wide range of
321.36,3.36,sources
322.639,5.681,such as application log files
324.72,5.84,transaction applications etc
328.32,3.68,also data warehouse centralizes and
330.56,3.6,consolidates
332.0,4.639,large amount of data from multiple
334.16,2.479,sources
336.88,4.8,we also have the real-time database
339.52,4.64,which is a database
341.68,4.32,that uses a real-time processing to
344.16,4.8,handle workloads
346.0,5.44,whose state is constantly changing
348.96,3.6,this differ from traditional databases
351.44,4.0,containing
352.56,4.0,persistent data mostly unaffected by
355.44,2.96,time
356.56,2.96,a very good example would be a stock
358.4,1.84,market
359.52,3.84,that
360.24,4.6,changes very rapidly rapidly and dynamic
363.36,4.48,in the real
364.84,4.68,time the recent development is the
367.84,4.56,social network
369.52,5.76,the internet example facebook twitter
372.4,4.32,linking and these organizations also
375.28,4.24,have their own
376.72,5.12,database system so social networks start
379.52,4.64,capturing a lot of information
381.84,4.24,about people and about communications
384.16,4.8,among people posts
386.08,4.16,twins photos videos and systems such as
388.96,4.079,facebook
390.24,5.92,twitter linking
393.039,5.201,search engines such as google bin yahoo
396.16,4.479,also collect their own
398.24,4.399,representative web pages for searching
400.639,4.161,purposes
402.639,4.481,now new technologies are emerging from
404.8,5.679,so-called known database software
407.12,6.24,vendors to manage vast amount of data
410.479,4.401,generated on the web
413.36,3.679,and big data
414.88,4.64,storage system involving large process
417.039,5.681,of distributed computers
419.52,5.84,and no sql system
422.72,5.759,also a large amount of data now reset on
425.36,5.2,the crowd which means it is a huge data
428.479,3.84,data centers using
430.56,3.52,thousands of machines
432.319,4.081,again the future lectures we shall go
434.08,4.8,through this concept especially
436.4,3.84,the null sql
438.88,3.36,now these are some of the basic
440.24,3.84,definitions in database management
442.24,4.32,system first we start with what is a
444.08,4.08,database again it's a collection of
446.56,3.68,related data
448.16,4.8,example will be a customer database
450.24,5.28,system or patient database
452.96,4.639,which means information about the
455.52,4.079,patients or customers
457.599,3.44,also what is the data data will be a
459.599,3.281,known facts
461.039,3.521,that can be recorded and have an
462.88,3.599,implicit meaning example would be a
464.56,5.759,patient's last name
466.479,5.84,or employee salary rate
470.319,4.16,meaning what means some part of the real
472.319,3.44,world about which data is stored in a
474.479,3.28,database
475.759,4.56,so example will be a student grade and
477.759,5.361,transcript at a university
480.319,5.28,then a database management system is the
483.12,4.16,software or the application
485.599,4.0,that we use to
487.28,4.56,create or develop
489.599,3.28,a database system and also
491.84,2.32,manage
492.879,4.72,and
494.16,5.2,manipulate the data in a database system
497.599,3.6,so a software package system to
499.36,5.2,facilitate the creation
501.199,5.201,and maintenance of computerized database
504.56,5.12,a database system now will be the
506.4,5.84,combination of a database software
509.68,4.64,and the data itself
512.24,4.4,and this is what discussed about
514.32,4.159,database system
516.64,4.24,how we can use the software to create
518.479,6.241,our data what tools we can use in the
520.88,6.32,software and how we can manage this data
524.72,5.119,if stored in the database
527.2,4.24,now the impact of databases and database
529.839,4.0,technology
531.44,5.12,in businesses for example banking
533.839,5.521,insurance retail transportation health
536.56,6.32,care manufacturer this business
539.36,6.8,organizations all use databases
542.88,6.079,because any business operation surely
546.16,5.04,data will be generated and this data
548.959,4.401,need to be stored somewhere we also have
551.2,3.68,service industries such as financial
553.36,4.0,real estate
554.88,3.84,legal electronic commerce small
557.36,4.32,businesses
558.72,5.679,also generate data so
561.68,5.279,they need database system to again store
564.399,5.041,their data and manage it education
566.959,4.241,resources for content and delivery
569.44,3.44,these resources also are stored in the
571.2,5.04,database system
572.88,6.32,most recently again example facebook
576.24,5.039,linking etc social network
579.2,5.68,environment and scientific applications
581.279,5.921,such as medicine and genetics
584.88,5.76,personalized application based on smart
587.2,5.28,mobile devices
590.64,4.24,now to simplify database system
592.48,3.68,environment normally we have three
594.88,4.399,levels
596.16,4.08,the the lower level is where our actual
599.279,2.881,data
600.24,3.36,is stored so here we see store data
602.16,3.44,definition
603.6,3.76,then the store database
605.6,4.16,in the future we shall discuss about
607.36,3.919,what is a mental data
609.76,4.24,then we have the middle tab which will
611.279,5.68,be the database manager software
614.0,5.12,we use it to create our environment and
616.959,4.481,we store the data we manage the data
619.12,5.04,from the user can only interact with the
621.44,4.0,system from the application programs or
624.16,3.52,queries
625.44,5.399,so we have database system database
627.68,6.719,management system then there's physical
630.839,5.721,storage so a typical database management
634.399,3.201,system functionality
636.56,3.76,can be
637.6,3.76,defining a particular database in terms
640.32,3.199,of
641.36,4.719,its data types structures and
643.519,4.641,constraints again our future lecture we
646.079,4.161,may discuss this more detail
648.16,4.72,also to construct or load the initial
650.24,3.839,database content on a secondary storage
652.88,4.399,medium
654.079,6.161,also manipulating the database
657.279,5.281,how to retrieve data using example query
660.24,5.599,or generating reports
662.56,6.08,also modifications inserting data
665.839,4.801,deleting data or update data in the
668.64,3.759,database system
670.64,3.84,accessing the database through a web
672.399,5.281,application
674.48,5.359,also processing and sharing by a set of
677.68,5.279,concurrent users and application
679.839,5.44,programs yet keeping all data valid and
682.959,5.041,consistent
685.279,4.081,so again database technology make all
688.0,3.6,this possible
689.36,3.68,application activities against a
691.6,4.4,database
693.04,5.2,here we say applications interact with a
696.0,3.68,database by generating
698.24,3.68,queries
699.68,4.96,queries that access different part of a
701.92,4.56,data and formulate a result of a request
704.64,4.4,a query normally will be a question that
706.48,5.2,we ask the system for example we have a
709.04,4.479,customer database system we can write a
711.68,4.8,query that we need all customers that
713.519,4.961,came from new york state or we need all
716.48,4.24,the customers that spend more than 50
718.48,4.64,dollars which means we have to write a
720.72,5.44,query to get a result we may have
723.12,4.959,thousand customers maybe only five
726.16,3.84,spend more than fifty dollars
728.079,6.401,we don't want to go through the
730.0,6.8,manually so using a query very quick
734.48,5.28,also transactions that may read some
736.8,5.52,data and update setting values or
739.76,4.0,generate new data and store that in a
742.32,4.639,database
743.76,6.16,applications must not allow unauthorized
746.959,5.68,users to access data
749.92,6.32,so that means application must allow
752.639,6.481,only authorized users to access data
756.24,4.8,that's security and also application
759.12,5.6,must keep up with changing user
761.04,5.84,requirement against the database
764.72,3.52,additional database management system
766.88,3.68,functionality
768.24,5.76,including protection or security
770.56,6.32,measures to prevent unauthorized assets
774.0,5.2,also active processing to take internal
776.88,5.519,actions on data
779.2,5.12,presentation and visualization of data
782.399,4.641,maintenance of the database and
784.32,4.959,associated programs over the lifetime of
787.04,4.88,the database application
789.279,4.641,also called a database or software or
791.92,3.84,system application
793.92,3.599,so in summary we went through different
795.76,4.16,types of database
797.519,3.76,the definition of database database
799.92,4.479,applications
801.279,5.841,and also the typical functionality of a
804.399,5.521,database management system so again this
807.12,4.8,is chapter one part one of our lectures
809.92,5.12,in the future lectures we may go through
811.92,6.919,detail about the few items we want here
815.04,3.799,thank you for your time
