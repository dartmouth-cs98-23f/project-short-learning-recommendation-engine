0.0,22.34,I want you to close your eyes and
18.15,7.68,imagine the image of a data scientist
22.34,7.029,are you picturing it but woody much
25.83,8.52,comes through your mind okay you may
29.369,7.701,open your eyes when people think about a
34.35,7.799,data scientist detained to imagine a
37.07,9.04,picture of a man in a you know lab coat
42.149,6.741,who maybe hasn't come for a while during
46.11,5.76,an artificial intelligence applying
48.89,5.14,algorithms and analyzing data to struck
51.87,8.369,insights for industrial or commercial
54.03,9.119,use but in reality the profile of a data
60.239,6.781,scientist requires the skills of the
63.149,6.51,polymath of a person whose expertise
67.02,6.66,spans across a significant number of
69.659,6.991,different areas of a person who embodies
73.68,10.53,the enterpreneur spirit and curiosity of
76.65,10.92,know Na da da Vinci in 2006 Singh LT
84.21,7.44,Smith the former CEO of Google said that
87.57,8.49,five exabytes of data were created since
91.65,7.23,the dawn of humanity until 2003 and that
96.06,6.9,today we are generating the same amount
98.88,6.57,of data every two days that's a huge
102.96,5.189,amount of data but the good news is that
105.45,6.419,the technology today enabled us to
108.149,11.601,handle process and analyze all the best
111.869,11.1,amount of information with the help of
119.75,6.43,artificial intelligence of machine
122.969,6.481,learning big data is being used for a
126.18,6.15,number of things for better profiling
129.45,4.22,users for doing personalized
132.33,6.14,recommendations for
133.67,7.44,health care and diagnosis for predicting
138.47,4.65,political revolution preventing crime on
141.11,4.44,even creating fine arts it's clear the
143.12,5.31,big data enhances human potential at
145.55,5.1,Alta data analytics we help large
148.43,4.8,organizations drive actionable insights
150.65,6.48,from all kinds of data to make a
153.23,6.03,difference and then when there's a
157.13,5.389,social debate like in the months after
159.26,6.449,the brexit we can analyze the data and
162.519,5.171,understand and map where the social
165.709,6.271,debate happens and what communities were
167.69,7.98,created we can see how the remainders
171.98,5.37,were opposed to the live community how
175.67,4.77,the media community was seated in the
177.35,4.949,middle kind of neutral how there was a
180.44,3.78,technical community which who were the
182.299,3.871,people talking about the economic and
184.22,3.45,social and political implications of the
186.17,5.49,back seat that were closer to the
187.67,5.97,remainer community we can see us all the
191.66,3.659,communities emerging like the Scottish
193.64,4.08,the supported Scottish which are closer
195.319,5.911,to the testes of the remainders or how
197.72,7.29,the US Republicans appear more in the
201.23,6.629,side of the brexit we can also analyze
205.01,5.4,and understand who were the most
207.859,4.051,influential people in the debate and how
210.41,3.66,the median is our birth position and
211.91,8.82,even predict what agendas will prevail
214.07,10.199,and as for a movie we can analyze far
220.73,8.099,more than what the analysts do that what
224.269,7.771,that critics say would say in Leonardo
228.829,5.101,DiCaprio's the documentary before the
232.04,4.8,flood documentary to raise awareness
233.93,5.79,about climate change we did this we
236.84,4.92,capture all the photo runs so that we
239.72,4.44,could analyze them understanding how
241.76,5.52,many of them DiCaprio Pearson how many
244.16,5.43,of them policymakers appear to
247.28,4.65,understand and determine which were the
249.59,7.649,aspects of climate change then trigger
251.93,8.369,more debate or we can understand as well
257.239,7.371,which of the visual sequences were share
260.299,4.311,and amplified in social media
265.11,6.82,an infection we can even predict trends
269.53,4.92,in fashion by analyzing the photographs
271.93,5.31,that people share in Instagram with
274.45,5.189,hashtags such as outfit of the day we
277.24,4.53,collect all the hundreds of thousands of
279.639,4.5,photos then we can analyze the
281.77,3.75,underlying influence of people sharing
284.139,3.451,those photos because we can see who
285.52,5.07,interacts with who and then see what
287.59,6.6,patterns emerge in the photos that the
290.59,8.25,most influential people share it's a
294.19,7.62,paradigm shift where we used to make
298.84,5.94,decisions made based on intuition and
301.81,4.59,guesswork now we can manage based on
304.78,10.94,evidence we can move to data-driven
306.4,14.46,decisions management guru Peter Drucker
315.72,7.57,said that you can not manage what you
320.86,5.25,cannot measure that's now there's no
323.29,8.1,excuse you can measure and you can
326.11,6.72,manage without the help of artificial
331.39,3.36,intelligence machine learning and all
332.83,4.55,the Big Data technologies we will not be
334.75,8.21,able to handle all this data revolution
337.38,10.36,but still the most important element in
342.96,7.78,driving inside out of data is what makes
347.74,5.9,a data scientist irreplaceable is a
350.74,2.9,human factor
357.79,7.67,the key to turn data into insight lies
362.26,6.53,in what we can do that machines can't
365.46,5.74,curiosity we all have access to Google
368.79,5.29,with billions of data points in Google
371.2,5.73,but it's your curiosity what little
374.08,5.64,Minds would you learn would you search
376.93,4.47,and therefore also would you filter and
379.72,6.42,how do you discover what's relevant to
381.4,7.02,you empathy and that is the key to
386.14,5.31,connect with others and to understand
388.42,6.39,what other people need Henry Ford said
391.45,4.95,if I would get if I could have asked
394.81,6.3,people what he wanted they would have
396.4,6.84,said faster horses imagination is the
401.11,11.46,key to his allies what nothing assists
403.24,13.47,yet creativity creativity is the key to
412.57,7.23,invent and articulate solutions to solve
416.71,6.39,problems communications is the key to
419.8,8.19,persuade to influence and to spread
423.1,9.18,ideas that create change and leadership
427.99,10.56,is the key to step up and move all these
432.28,11.97,people to action and at the center of
438.55,9.42,them all is curiosity because it is
444.25,8.85,curiosity for emotions that drives
447.97,7.83,empathy it is curiosity for ideas the
453.1,5.46,tribe's imagination with his curiosity
455.8,5.25,for solutions the drives creativity it
458.56,4.92,is curiosity for influencing that draws
461.05,4.85,communications and it is curiosity for
463.48,9.21,results that in the end drives
465.9,8.86,leadership the most important skill of a
472.69,6.6,data scientist is asking the right
474.76,7.23,question to data the curiosity of a data
479.29,6.0,scientist to us that drive those right
481.99,7.06,questions to iterate to understand human
485.29,6.999,issues to imagine the possibilities
489.05,6.63,to create an articulate solutions to
492.289,5.25,convey the message and insights with the
495.68,5.31,right visuals to make them actionable
497.539,7.59,those are the key elements that turn
500.99,7.53,data into something meaningful it's a
505.129,11.85,set of skills that no artificial
508.52,10.59,intelligence can match yet it's it is at
516.979,7.17,the intersection of Technology and
519.11,8.0,liberal arts where magic happens if the
524.149,6.211,Renaissance of the 14th and 17th century
527.11,5.26,was the cultural force that drove
530.36,6.41,humanity out of the Middle Ages and into
532.37,8.52,the modern era the Big Data Renaissance
536.77,6.73,is already unveiled as possibilities to
540.89,4.889,push human the human race forward with
543.5,6.39,the power of data it is up to us to
545.779,11.221,imagine what data and machines will do
549.89,10.43,for us remember that a fool with a tool
557.0,3.32,is still a fool
560.41,6.239,big data is not only about technology
568.6,8.35,big data and it's big brains big data
573.38,7.28,needs the curious brain of an artist to
576.95,3.71,make a difference thank you
