0.4,4.32,star wars fans would be familiar with
2.24,5.44,the golden life-sized hospitality robot
4.72,5.52,c-3po while star wars might be set in a
7.68,4.48,galaxy far far away the reality of
10.24,4.16,having machines talk and respond to us
12.16,4.24,in a human-like manner is already a
14.4,4.639,reality which keeps getting more and
16.4,4.24,more realistic with every passing day
19.039,3.841,the people you ask for queries on
20.64,4.24,websites your smart assistants even
22.88,4.319,calls made over the internet all of them
24.88,3.92,have one thing in common none of them
27.199,3.761,are actually human
28.8,4.32,now you must be thinking if they are not
30.96,4.48,human how do they manage to sound and
33.12,4.48,seem so human-like how do they respond
35.44,3.6,to me so intelligently and how are they
37.6,3.84,so articulate
39.04,4.16,this my friends is the magic of natural
41.44,3.6,language processing
43.2,4.4,what is nlp
45.04,4.16,natural language processing or nlp
47.6,3.52,refers to the branch of artificial
49.2,4.56,intelligence that gives the machines the
51.12,4.72,ability to read understand and derive
53.76,4.319,meaning from human languages
55.84,3.92,nlp combines the field of linguistics
58.079,3.841,and computer science to decipher
59.76,4.16,language structure and guidelines and to
61.92,4.32,make models which can comprehend break
63.92,4.08,down and separate significant details
66.24,3.76,from text and speech
68.0,3.76,every day humans interact with each
70.0,4.0,other through public social media
71.76,4.16,transferring vast quantities of freely
74.0,3.92,available data to each other
75.92,3.76,this data is extremely useful in
77.92,3.28,understanding human behavior and
79.68,3.119,customer habits
81.2,3.76,data analysts and machine learning
82.799,4.401,experts utilize this data to give
84.96,3.92,machines the ability to mimic human
87.2,3.52,linguistic behavior
88.88,3.84,this helps save millions in terms of
90.72,3.759,manpower and time as you don't need to
92.72,3.28,always have a person present at the
94.479,3.921,other end of a phone
96.0,4.96,nlp is also a lot more widespread than
98.4,4.56,you may realize you use it every day in
100.96,4.159,seemingly normal and insignificant
102.96,3.36,situations don't know how to correctly
105.119,3.36,spell a word
106.32,3.92,autocorrect has you covered
108.479,3.041,need to see if your article or thesis
110.24,2.559,will get flagged for copyright
111.52,3.599,violations
112.799,3.841,that's okay a plagiarism checker will
115.119,3.521,search through the web and find any
116.64,4.24,cases of published documents which may
118.64,4.64,match your work line by line
120.88,4.32,while nlp seems really cool yet a
123.28,2.96,cutting edge and complicated technology
125.2,3.36,concept
126.24,4.48,it is actually pretty easy to learn you
128.56,4.0,start off with a document or an article
130.72,4.239,to make your algorithm understand what
132.56,3.92,is going on in it you need to process it
134.959,3.841,into a form which is easily
136.48,4.16,comprehensible by the machine
138.8,4.96,this is no different than making a child
140.64,5.52,learn to read for the first time
143.76,4.32,you start off by performing segmentation
146.16,4.56,which is to break the entire document
148.08,4.239,down into its constituent sentences
150.72,3.68,you can do this by segmenting the
152.319,4.721,article along its punctuations like full
154.4,4.479,stops and commas for the algorithm to
157.04,3.919,understand these sentences we get the
158.879,4.801,words in a sentence and to explain them
160.959,4.081,individually to our algorithm so we
163.68,4.08,break down our sentence into its
165.04,5.04,constituent words and store them this is
167.76,3.6,called tokenizing where each word is
170.08,3.519,called a token
171.36,4.08,we can make the learning process faster
173.599,3.36,by getting rid of non-essential words
175.44,3.68,which do not add much meaning to our
176.959,4.161,statement and are just there to make our
179.12,5.199,statement sound more cohesive
181.12,4.88,these words such as are and the are
184.319,3.28,called stop words
186.0,3.519,now that we have the basic form of our
187.599,2.881,document we need to explain it to our
189.519,2.72,machine
190.48,4.56,we first start off by explaining that
192.239,5.041,some words like skipping skips skipped
195.04,3.76,are the same word with added prefixes
197.28,4.16,and suffixes
198.8,4.719,this is called stemming we also identify
201.44,4.799,the base words for different word tense
203.519,5.121,mood gender etc this is called
206.239,3.36,limitization stemming from the base word
208.64,3.12,lemma
209.599,4.321,now we explain the concept of nouns
211.76,4.64,verbs articles and other parts of speech
213.92,5.28,to the machine by adding these tags to
216.4,3.839,our words this is called part of speech
219.2,2.8,tagging
220.239,3.92,next we introduce our machine to pop
222.0,4.08,culture references and everyday names by
224.159,4.881,flagging names of movies important
226.08,4.48,personalities or locations etc that may
229.04,3.919,occur in the document
230.56,4.48,this is called named entity tagging
232.959,3.84,once we have our base words and tags we
235.04,3.199,use a machine learning algorithm like
236.799,3.44,naive bayes
238.239,2.961,to teach our model humans sentiment and
240.239,2.56,speech
241.2,3.759,at the end of the day most of the
242.799,3.601,techniques used in nlp are simple
244.959,2.801,grammar techniques that we have been
246.4,3.039,taught in school
247.76,3.839,here is a question for you
249.439,4.08,which of these nlp techniques is used to
251.599,3.521,obtain words from sentences
253.519,2.241,a stemming
255.12,2.16,b
255.76,3.599,tokenization
257.28,4.239,c limitization
259.359,3.921,d segmentation
261.519,3.761,give it a thought and leave your answers
