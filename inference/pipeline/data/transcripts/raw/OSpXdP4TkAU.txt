0.0,3.18,Hello and welcome to our video on NoSQL databases!
3.9,4.92,"What is a NoSQL database?
NoSQL stands for ""Not Only SQL.""  "
9.48,5.1,"It refers to a class of database management 
systems that do not use the traditional SQL  "
14.58,5.64,"relational database model. Instead, NoSQL 
databases use a variety of different  "
20.22,6.12,"models for storing and retrieving data, such as 
key-value pairs, documents, or graph structures."
27.12,6.12,"Brief history of NoSQL databases
NoSQL databases have been around for about two  "
33.24,5.34,"decades, but they have gained popularity in recent 
years due to the explosion of data being collected  "
38.58,6.9,"and stored by businesses and organizations. NoSQL 
databases are often used in situations where the  "
45.48,5.04,"data being stored is too large or complex to be 
easily managed with a traditional SQL database."
51.36,4.68,"NoSQL database features
NoSQL databases are highly  "
56.04,6.06,"flexible and can handle a wide variety of data 
types and structures. They are also often designed  "
62.1,5.22,"for horizontal scalability, which means that 
they can easily handle a large volume of data by  "
67.32,6.84,"adding more servers to the database cluster. Some 
NoSQL databases offer features such as automatic  "
74.16,4.92,"sharding and replication, which can improve the 
performance and reliability of the database."
79.92,3.9,"Types of NoSQL databases
There are several different  "
83.82,6.72,"types of NoSQL databases, including key-value 
stores, document databases, and graph databases.  "
91.44,5.16,"Key-value stores are designed to store data as 
a simple key-value pair, with the key being used  "
96.6,6.78,"to retrieve the value. Document databases store 
data as documents, which can contain complex data  "
103.38,5.64,"structures. Graph databases are used to store 
and query data that has complex relationships."
109.8,4.92,"When should NoSQL be used?
NoSQL databases are well-suited for  "
114.72,6.12,"use in applications with a large volume of data 
or a high number of users. They are also often  "
120.84,6.06,"used in web applications, where they can help 
to improve performance and scalability. However,  "
126.9,5.76,"NoSQL databases may not be the best choice for 
all situations, and it is important to carefully  "
132.66,4.86,"consider the specific needs of your application 
before deciding which type of database to use."
