0.35,2.65,"Hello friends, welcome to Gate Smashers"
3.025,3.54,"In today's video, we are going to
discuss about Von Newmann's architecture"
6.59,4.41,"or we call it stored memory
architecture or stored memory program"
11.001,1.999,What does it mean by stored memory?
13.225,3.775,Where we keep two things inside memory
17.001,5.999,"one is data and second is
program or set of instructions"
23.001,2.551,"Data means like we
write in program"
25.577,7.804,"or in processing in C program
int A=10, B=20, C=A+B"
33.406,5.846,"the kind of variables or constants 
we are defining there"
39.277,4.911,"where will we store all this data?
inside memory!"
44.2,3.458,"Which memory? 
Main memory!"
47.683,2.242,"and secondly we store, program"
49.95,2.064,Program means set of instructions
52.059,3.066,Instructions are how to do work
55.15,3.85,"we have many different 
type of instruction set available"
59.15,3.487,"Like if you have
heard about MBI, MOV command"
62.649,3.918,"we have ADD,
SUB, branch statement"
66.592,3.03,"All these commands or processes
has different commands"
69.647,4.058,"All these commands and
this data where to store it?"
73.73,3.454,"In one memory and which memory is that?
Main memory"
77.318,4.682,"Yes, you can store it in different
addresses in main memory"
82.001,6.276,"In some addresses you can store instructions
and in some addresses you can store data"
88.302,4.054,"Its opposite Harvard architecture
which was opposite of Von Newmann's"
92.512,3.928,"It said that we will store instruction
set in different memory"
96.465,2.686,and data in different memory.
99.176,3.509,"But here we are keeping
both things in same memory"
102.763,4.746,"And if you look carefully, in today's
time whatever architecture we are using"
107.534,6.353,We are keeping data and program in main memory
113.912,2.231,Secondly we have here is component
116.315,3.228,"This Von Newmann's diagram,
Von Newmann's architecture"
119.568,4.809,"Basically it also tells us which
components of basic computer architecture."
124.402,2.657,Which help in processing data
127.192,6.197,"What components are there
to convert input to output"
133.414,3.929,"So one is main memory where we are
keeping two things data and instructions"
137.454,2.116,After that comes our CPU
140.059,4.941,"CPU central processing unit 
And from here main work starts"
145.237,2.825,In this we have different components
148.074,3.533,"First is arithmetic and logical unit, ALU"
151.632,2.186,What is the purpose of ALU?
153.843,3.69,In ALU many circuits are available
157.558,3.873,"In digital we have different circuits 
We have adder, we have subtractor"
161.456,6.544,"With the help of which we do addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division,"
168.001,5.63,"AND operation, OR operation,
XOR, AND and we have shift operation"
173.656,5.043,"Many operations we use like
arithmetic operation or logical operation"
178.724,3.15,We perform them through ALU
181.94,2.469,"And in ALU different
circuits are available"
184.421,3.579,"which help in performing
all these operations"
188.001,2.999,Then we have registers
191.001,6.478,"Registers are basically the fastest
memory available we have is registers"
197.504,7.027,"They store temporary
data and size is very small"
204.731,6.269,"Smallest size memory is called registers
and it is storing data temporarily"
211.1,1.9,How much size can it be basically?
213.001,4.264,"Let's say 8 bits, means 1 byte 16 bits"
217.29,3.775,So basically we have sequence of bits
221.225,2.956,Sequence of bits is called registers
224.206,3.068,Or you can say sequence of flip flops
227.407,2.983,Because flip flops also store one bit
230.479,4.032,"So if you combine multiple flip
flops it will become registers"
234.689,4.311,"But the important point here
is that why are registers used?"
239.001,2.446,When we already have main memory available
241.472,2.053,"So what is the benefit of the
register when there is memory?"
243.55,3.829,"And why is the register
embedded on the CPU chip?"
247.404,1.639,The reason is speed
249.131,7.153,"Any operation we perform 
Let's say A=10, B=20, C=A+B"
256.309,1.922,Now where is this data stored?
258.298,2.702,"In main memory
Where will it perform?"
261.001,2.0,"This is arithmetic operation
Where will it perform?"
263.15,4.892,In ALU. So ALU has a very fast speed
268.067,3.109,And the main memory is also fast
271.242,2.821,But compatible to ALU is very slow
274.088,0.988,Now what will happen?
275.165,1.501,"If speed mismatches,"
276.691,3.309,"One person is working fast 
And other is working slowly"
280.001,1.593,"Then obviously there will
be a burden on one person"
281.619,3.46,"So the registers help
to reduce that burden"
285.104,1.392,What registers do is
286.607,4.393,"Temporarily store the data, the
intermediate results, the output and input"
291.025,3.975,"They are used to store them
temporarily and intermediately"
295.001,2.446,"You must have heard the
name of many different registers."
297.472,3.804,Although we will discuss this in detail later
301.301,1.531,But like program counter
302.978,5.414,"The next instruction to execute, that
address is stored in program counter"
308.44,3.56,"This is also a register 
Apart from that we have accumulator"
312.001,3.401,"Which is used to store
the intermediate results"
315.427,3.573,"There is input register, output
register, MAR, memory addressable"
319.175,5.825,"So all these registers help
to speed up the processing"
325.001,6.047,"And work as an intermediator 
between ALU and main memory"
331.073,1.927,Then we have control unit
333.001,3.93,Control unit is a very important factor
336.956,2.575,We have two things in control unit
339.731,1.916,One is timing signal
345.59,3.6,And the second is control signals.
353.05,2.569,Timing signal basically means timing
355.644,3.356,"Means which instruction will be
executed first and which will be after"
359.001,5.999,"Means let's say we have
10 instructions in the program"
365.001,3.999,"Now which instructions to
execute first and which later"
369.001,2.773,This is basically a very important factor
371.799,2.602,Let's say if you drive a car
374.489,2.732,Now we know in the car what the instructions are
377.246,3.464,"First we press the clutch 
Then we put the gear"
380.735,2.597,Then we accelerate slowly
383.399,2.601,this sequence of instructions
386.001,3.7,"Sequence of steps 
Do not do them up and down"
389.726,3.274,"If you do so,then the 
output can be different"
393.001,3.567,"So to do this work we
need dedicated hardware"
396.58,2.968,"And that hardware is
basically control unit"
399.573,3.131,So timing signals generate timing here
402.949,3.8,Every timing signal performs some action
407.001,3.999,"Then we have control signal
Control signal basically,"
411.3,5.7,"That we have so many registers, input
register, output register, PC, accumulator"
417.001,4.999,"There are many registers We can read
them, we are writing something in them"
422.001,4.999,"How to control all these, It should
not be that you are accessing the data"
427.001,3.27,"And the registers are busy somewhere
else, executing some other work"
430.296,3.139,"To perform all these
read write operations"
433.46,3.54,"We use control
signals in the register"
437.001,1.999,Control signals are like your mind
439.2,2.8,"Like our arms, our legs"
442.15,3.186,"How to move them, how to give instructions"
445.402,2.177,"Who is giving these instructions, our mind is"
447.604,2.173,So here the control signals
449.802,5.198,"Control signals control them How
to read and access the registers"
455.001,2.055,"Who has to do it first,
who has to do it later"
457.068,2.572,"So this control unit
is very important here"
459.665,2.335,Which is playing a major role.
462.45,5.55,"This Von Neumann's architecture, is
a very basic architecture given in 1945"
468.001,5.999,"But the main point here is
How the data is processed"
474.15,2.596,The data that we keep in the main memory
476.771,2.464,We call the data from there to the CPU
479.368,4.979,"And we process the registers in the
CPU, the ALU processes them"
484.413,2.296,"And gives the output
back to the main memory"
486.753,2.247,"And from the
main memory to the next"
489.001,1.999,"Where ever it is, the user
has to show on the monitor"
491.001,1.959,Or have to store in the secondary memory
492.985,2.131,This is how we process the data
495.204,3.796,"So this also helps you 
As a computer science student, you will know"
499.225,4.775,"How the work is done in a computer 
So it is showing that too here"
504.001,2.999,"So these are all the main components
After that we have input-output system"
507.001,3.999,"Means we have peripheral devices
Input devices like keyboard, monitors"
511.001,2.223,"And output devices, we have monitors"
513.249,2.915,So all these devices come to our next level
516.252,2.748,So basically we have this main architecture
519.001,3.934,"It tells us what is
the benefit of these components"
523.093,2.723,Now how can we attach these components
525.841,3.025,Attaching means network topology
529.049,1.73,Like we study in networks
530.804,1.96,"There is mesh topology, bus topology,"
532.776,3.224,"star topology it helps
different components"
536.001,5.582,"Because we have main memory, registers
Control unit, means this is the whole CPU"
541.672,4.839,"How we have to connect them
We connect them through bus"
547.001,4.676,"There are different types of buses
Means we have address bus, data bus"
551.702,2.298,"There are different types of
buses And how their work is"
554.001,2.999,We will discuss this later in the next video
557.025,2.975,"We basically implement this
with the help of multiplexers"
560.001,2.999,"So this is the Von Neumann's
diagram Von Neumann's architecture"
563.001,3.999,"Basically you have to remember this
That stored memory program is there"
567.001,3.999,"What is there in memory and
apart from this we have all the components"
571.001,3.999,"And what is the benefit of those
components, how they perform"
575.001,2.901,So this is all about the Von Neumann's architecture
577.991,0.867,Thank you.
