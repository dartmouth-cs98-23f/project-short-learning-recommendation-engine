0.39,4.54,"If you punch your credit card number into
a website and hit “submit”, I bet you"
4.93,4.33,"don’t want to have twenty fraudulent charges
on your bank account a week later. This is"
9.26,5.34,"why all serious online retailers use encryption
protocols. In this video, I want to tell you"
14.6,3.48,"how quantum mechanics can help us keep secrets
safe."
18.08,5.089,"Before I get to quantum cryptography, I briefly
have to tell you how the normal, non-quantum"
23.169,5.36,"cryptography works, the one that most of the
internet uses today. If you know this already,"
28.529,3.611,"you can use the YouTube tool bar to jump to
the next chapter."
32.14,5.009,"The cryptographic codes that are presently
being used online are for the most part public"
37.149,5.861,"key systems. The word “key” refers to
the method that you use to encrypt a message."
43.01,5.09,"It’s basically an algorithm that converts
readable text or data into a mess, but it"
48.1,5.65,"creates this mess in a predictable way, so
that the messing up can be undone. If the"
53.75,5.179,"key is public, this means everybody knows
how to encrypt a message, but only the recipient"
58.929,1.82,knows how to decrypt it.
60.749,5.031,"This may sound somewhat perplexing, because
if the key is public and everybody knows how"
65.78,6.43,"to scramble up a message, then it seems everybody
also knows how to unscramble it. It does not"
72.21,5.39,"sound very secure. But the clever part of
public key cryptography is that to encode"
77.6,5.39,"the message you use a method that is easy
to do, but hard to undo."
82.99,4.41,"You can think of this as if the website you
are buying from gives you, not a key, but"
87.4,4.649,"an empty treasure chest that locks when you
close it. You take the chest. Put in your"
92.049,5.201,"credit card number, close it. And now the
only person who can open it, is the one who"
97.25,6.7,"knows how to unlock it. So your message is
safe to send. In practice that treasure chest"
103.95,4.91,"is locked by a mathematical problem that is
easy to pose but really hard to solve."
108.86,4.98,"There are various mathematical problems that
can, and that are being used, in cryptographic"
113.84,5.27,"protocols for locking the treasure chest.
The best known one is the factorization of"
119.11,5.58,"a large number into primes. This method is
used by the algorithm known as RSA, after"
124.69,4.629,"its inventors Rivest (i as in kit), Shamir,
and Adleman. The idea behind RSA is that if"
129.319,4.511,"you have two large prime numbers, it is easy
to multiply them. But if you only have the"
133.83,4.92,"product of the two primes, then it is very
difficult to find out what its prime-factors"
138.75,3.36,"are.
For RSA, the public key, the one that locks"
142.11,5.43,"the treasure chest, is a number that is derived
from the product of the primes, but does not"
147.54,5.39,"contain the prime factors themselves. You
can therefore use the public key to encode"
152.93,5.22,"a message, but to decode it, you need the
prime factors, which only the recipient of"
158.15,5.729,"your message has, for example the retailer
to whom you are sending your credit card information."
163.879,6.22,"Now, this public key can be broken, in principle,
because we do know algorithms to decompose"
170.099,5.371,"numbers into their prime factors. But for
large numbers, these algorithms take very,"
175.47,5.46,"very long, to give you a result, even on the
world’s presently most powerful computers."
180.93,4.919,"So, maybe that key you are using can be broken,
given a hundred thousand years of computation"
185.849,5.331,"time. But really who cares. For all practical
purposes, these keys are safe."
191.18,4.91,"But here’s the thing. Whether or not someone
can break one of these public keys depends"
196.09,5.18,"on how quickly they can solve the mathematical
problem behind it. And quantum computers can"
201.27,6.13,"vastly speed up computation. You can see the
problem: Quantum computers can break cryptographic"
207.4,6.66,"protocols, such as RSA, in a short time. And
that is a big security risk."
214.06,5.1,"I explained in a previous video what quantum
computers are and what to expect from them,"
219.16,4.92,"so check this out if you want to know more.
But just how quantum computers work doesn’t"
224.08,5.36,"matter so much here. It only matters that
you know, if you had a powerful quantum computer,"
229.44,5.76,"it could break some public key cryptosystems
that are currently widely being used, and"
235.2,1.85,it could do that quickly.
237.05,4.359,"This is a problem which does not only affect
your credit card number but really everything"
241.409,5.621,"from trade to national security. Now, we are
nowhere near having a quantum computer that"
247.03,5.14,"could actually do such a computation. But
the risk that one could be built in the next"
252.17,5.97,"decades is high enough so that computer scientists
and physicists have thought of ways to make"
258.14,2.65,public key cryptography more secure.
260.79,5.71,"They have come up with various cryptographic
protocols that cannot be broken by quantum"
266.5,5.54,"computers. This is possible by using protocols
which rely on mathematical problems for which"
272.04,5.92,"a quantum computer does not bring an advantage.
This cryptography, which is safe from quantum"
277.96,7.43,"computers is called “post-quantum cryptography”
or, sometimes, “quantum resistant cryptography”."
285.39,5.08,"Post-quantum cryptographic protocols do not
themselves use quantum effects. They have"
290.47,4.75,"the word “quantum” in their name merely
to say that they cannot be broken even with"
295.22,5.72,"quantum computers. At least according to present
knowledge. This situation can change because"
300.94,4.53,"it’s possible that in the future someone
will find a way to use a quantum computer"
305.47,6.75,"to break a code currently considered unbreakable.
However, at least at the moment, some cryptographic"
312.22,4.64,"protocols exist for which no one knows how
a quantum computer could break them."
316.86,4.71,"So, computer scientists have ways to keep
the internet safe, even if someone, somewhere"
321.57,5.68,"develops a powerful quantum computer. Indeed,
most nations already have plans to switch"
327.25,4.81,"to post-quantum cryptography in the coming
decade, if not sooner."
332.06,5.66,"Let us then come to quantum cryptography,
and its application for “quantum key distribution”."
337.72,4.75,"Quantum key distribution is a method for two
parties to securely share a key that they"
342.47,5.781,"can then use to encode messages. And quantum
physics is what helps keep the key safe. To"
348.251,4.78,"explain how this works, I will again just
use the simplest example, that’s a protocol"
353.031,6.189,"known as BB Eighty-four, after the authors
Bennett and Brassard and the year of publication."
359.22,5.71,"When physicists talk about information transfer,
they like to give names to senders and receivers."
364.93,4.76,"Usually they are called Alice and Bob, so
that’s what I will call them to. Alice wants"
369.69,5.09,"to send a secret key to Bob so they can then
have a little chat, but she does not want"
374.78,5.0,"Bob’s wife, Eve, to know what they’re
talking about. In the literature, this third"
379.78,6.05,"party is normally called “Eve” because
she is “eavesdropping”, hahaha, physics"
385.83,3.67,"humor.
So, Alice creates a random sequence of particles"
389.5,4.9,"that can have spin either up or down. She
measures the spin of each particle and then"
394.4,5.03,"sends it to Bob who also measures the spin.
Each time they measure spin up, they note"
399.43,5.47,"down a zero, and each time they measure spin
down, they note down a one. This way, they"
404.9,6.06,"get a randomly created, shared sequence of
bits, which they can use to encode messages."
410.96,5.64,"But this is no good. The problem is, this
key can easily be intercepted by Eve. She"
416.6,5.39,"could catch the particle meant for Bob in
midflight, measure it, note down the number,"
421.99,3.32,"and then pass it on to Bob. That’s a recipe
for disaster."
425.31,5.52,"So, Alice picks up her physics textbooks and
makes the sequence of particles that she sends"
430.83,4.41,"to Bob more complicated.
That the spin is up or down means Alice has"
435.24,5.12,"to choose a direction along which to create
the spin. Bob has to know this direction to"
440.36,5.521,"make his measurement, because different directions
of spins obey an uncertainty relation. It"
445.881,4.819,"is here where quantum mechanics becomes important.
If you measure the direction of a spin into"
450.7,6.63,"one direction, then the measurement into a
perpendicular direction is maximally uncertain."
457.33,5.51,"For a binary variable like the spin, this
just means the measurements in two orthogonal"
462.84,6.18,"directions are uncorrelated. If Alice sends
a particle that has spin up or down, but Bob"
469.02,5.23,"mistakenly measures the spin in the horizontal
direction, he just gets left or right with"
474.25,1.74,fifty percent probability.
475.99,5.74,"Now, what Alice does is to randomly choose
whether the particles’ spin goes in the"
481.73,5.39,"up-down or left-right direction. As before,
she sends the particles to Bob, but – and"
487.12,4.44,"here is the important bit – does not tell
him whether the particle was created in the"
491.56,5.27,"up-down or left-right direction. Since Bob
does not know the direction, he randomly picks"
496.83,4.52,"one for his measurement. If he happens to
pick the same direction that Alice used to"
501.35,5.65,"create the particle, then he gets, as previously,
a perfectly correlated result. But if he picks"
507.0,4.05,"the wrong one, he gets a completely uncorrelated
result."
511.05,5.4,"After they have done that, Alice sends Bob
information about which directions she used."
516.45,5.44,"For that, she can use an unencrypted channel.
Once Bob knows that, he discards the measurements"
521.89,5.37,"where he picked the wrong setting. The remaining
measurements are then correlated, and that’s"
527.26,1.3,the secret key.
528.56,5.06,"What happens now if Eve tries to intersect
the key that Alice sends? Here’s the thing:"
533.62,5.11,"She cannot do that without Bob and Alice noticing.
That’s because she does not know either"
538.73,5.79,"which direction Alice used to create the particles.
If Eve measures in the wrong direction – say,"
544.52,5.16,"left-right instead of up-down – she changes
the spin of the particle, but she has no way"
549.68,5.79,"of knowing whether that happened or not.
If she then passes on her measurement result"
555.47,5.8,"to Bob, and it’s a case where Bob did pick
the correct setting, then his measurement"
561.27,5.27,"result will no longer be correlated with Alice’s,
when it should be. So, what Alice and Bob"
566.54,5.9,"do is that they compare some part of the sequence
they have shared, again they can do that using"
572.44,5.29,"an unencrypted channel, and they can check
whether their measurements were indeed correlated"
577.73,5.0,"when they should have been. If that’s not
the case, they know someone tried to intercept"
582.73,3.18,the message. This is what makes the key safe.
585.91,5.96,"The deeper reason this works is that in quantum
mechanics it is impossible to copy an arbitrary"
591.87,5.77,"state without destroying it. This is known
as the no-cloning theorem, and this is ultimately"
597.64,4.66,"why Eve cannot listen in without Bob and Alice
finding out."
602.3,5.66,"So, quantum key distribution is a secure way
to exchange a secret key, which can be done"
607.96,5.84,"either through optical fiber or just free
space. Quantum key distribution actually already"
613.8,5.5,"exists and is being used commercially, though
it is not in widespread use. However, in this"
619.3,5.48,"case the encoded message itself is still sent
through a classical channel without quantum"
624.78,1.39,effects.
626.17,5.53,"Quantum key distribution is an example for
quantum cryptography, but quantum cryptography"
631.7,6.55,"also more generally refers to using quantum
effects to encode messages, not just to exchange"
638.25,5.11,"keys. But this more general quantum cryptography
so far exists only theoretically."
643.36,7.11,"So, to summarize: “Post quantum cryptography”
refers to non-quantum cryptography that cannot"
650.47,6.07,"be broken with a quantum computer. It exists
and is in the process of becoming widely adopted."
656.54,5.46,"“Quantum key distribution” exploits quantum
effects to share a key that is secure from"
662.0,5.08,"eavesdropping. It does already exist though
it is not widely used. “Quantum cryptography”"
667.08,5.7,"beyond quantum key distribution would use
quantum effects to actually share messages."
672.78,4.42,"The theory exists but it has not been realized
technologically."
677.2,4.811,"Having said that, let us talk for a moment
about your personal security and NordVPN who"
682.011,4.909,"have been sponsoring this video. NordVPN is
a software that you install on your laptop"
686.92,4.88,"or phone and it keeps you safe as you browse
the internet. It does not rely on a public"
691.8,5.62,"key system, like RSA that I talked about earlier,
but instead uses AES, that’s the Advanced"
697.42,5.89,"Encryption Standard. AES is based on a symmetric
key that is known to both of the communicating"
703.31,4.82,"parties. You use the NordVPN app to connect
to one of their servers and browse the web"
708.13,5.38,"from there. This keeps your data safe even
on a public wireless. Better still, you can"
713.51,4.15,"choose your “location” from any one of
their more than five thousand servers all"
717.66,4.7,"over the world. So, if you ever encounter
a video that won’t play where you are, it"
722.36,5.12,"takes but a click to solve the problem.
You can now get sixty-eight percent off their"
727.48,6.44,"two-year plan and one additional month free
if you go to nordvpn dot org slash sabine"
733.92,5.96,"and use the coupon code sabine, that’s S
