0.0,5.94,Hanne students coming to the next topic
2.31,6.119,that is the user interface design so
5.94,5.64,here it's the name itself is saying that
8.429,5.101,a user interface design user means we
11.58,4.83,are the people we are communicating with
13.53,5.43,the software we are interfacing some
16.41,7.23,user interface design is helpful to the
18.96,6.72,users to access the web pages so the
23.64,5.729,user interface is first it is a
25.68,6.599,front-end the user interface is so I am
29.369,6.991,writing UI as a user interface user
32.279,5.85,interface is a front end application we
36.36,4.17,call it as a front-end application
38.129,4.801,because we are accessing that page so
40.53,3.869,that is present in front of us so that's
42.93,4.74,why we call it as a friend and
44.399,10.68,application it is a front-end
47.67,14.189,application view to which user interacts
55.079,9.061,in order to use the software so the user
61.859,4.83,wants to use the software so with the
64.14,5.64,help of this user interface applications
66.689,5.161,so the user user interface applications
69.78,4.47,of front-end application view to which
71.85,5.159,the user interacts in order to use the
74.25,8.659,software so here in the user interface
77.009,5.9,regional design user can manipulate
83.509,7.72,manipulate and control software and
88.11,4.92,hardware so the user can have the chap
91.229,4.561,permissions to manipulate and control
93.03,7.92,the software as well as the hardware by
95.79,7.2,means of by means of user interface so
100.95,6.059,with the help of the user interface only
102.99,6.69,this user that user can manipulate and
107.009,6.75,control hardware as well as the software
109.68,7.049,with the help of this user interface so
113.759,5.07,let us take one example so in this
116.729,5.761,example suppose today whatever user
118.829,6.091,interface we are founding is is one at
122.49,4.83,most every place like we're in Vista
124.92,4.979,technologies that exists so like right
127.32,4.74,from computers in the computers we are
129.899,3.331,having the user interface so which you
132.06,3.33,are seeing else
133.23,5.399,so the Windows desktop whatever you open
135.39,5.01,that is an user interface okay so it's a
138.629,3.511,if you want to manipulate and control
140.4,4.979,any software and the hardware in your
142.14,5.489,system you need some user interface
145.379,4.621,these are device so with the help of
147.629,4.021,this user interface you are going to
150.0,3.09,manipulate and control all the
151.65,3.96,software's that are present in your
153.09,4.95,system as well as the hard bits so just
155.61,7.08,like a computer a computer is one of the
158.04,7.949,user interface design means it I user
162.69,7.17,interfaces found in computers in the
165.989,5.731,same way in the mobile phones in the
169.86,3.659,mobile phones you are having the user
171.72,3.81,interface means whatever you are seeing
173.519,5.821,on that small phone that is a user in
175.53,5.519,user view it is a friend tender which is
179.34,4.14,an applique user interface which is a
181.049,5.401,front-end application view so that will
183.48,7.47,be provided in mobile phones in the same
186.45,8.0,way in the cars or in airplanes even in
190.95,6.659,music players everything you can find
194.45,9.369,every digital technology you can find
197.609,9.391,the user interface etc so this user
203.819,7.32,interface provides fundamental platform
207.0,11.4,for human-computer interaction it
211.139,11.451,provides platform this user interface
218.4,4.19,design provides a platform for
224.0,9.88,human-computer interaction and it is
230.79,6.96,also a part of a software so this user
233.88,8.009,interface can be graphically text based
237.75,5.94,or audio based depending upon the
241.889,5.82,hardware and the software combinations
243.69,8.689,that you are using on the systems so the
247.709,9.381,software becomes
252.379,6.781,the software becomes most popular when
257.09,10.74,you can say that software becomes more
259.16,17.689,popular becomes most popular if its user
267.83,16.97,interface is if its user interface is
276.849,7.951,attractive simple to use
286.93,12.1,responsive in short time responsive in
293.44,9.009,short time and clear to understand clear
299.03,6.18,to understand then only we can say that
302.449,4.56,software becomes most popular so if you
305.21,3.54,take any mobile phone okay in your
307.009,4.47,mobile phone yeah I install some apps
308.75,7.02,means some software you install so when
311.479,6.841,you it becomes more popular when that
315.77,5.489,app becomes most popular when that app
318.32,6.12,is more attractive so if you if you are
321.259,5.611,going to access that app that software
324.44,4.68,means that is it which is consisting of
326.87,4.59,some user interface so by seeing that
329.12,4.2,app it suppose it is somewhat colorful
331.46,2.79,and somewhat friendly if it is
333.32,4.14,attractive
334.25,5.789,it becomes more popular and if it is
337.46,4.53,simple to use without complications the
340.039,4.921,app is going to be used very simple
341.99,5.429,okay so then it becomes most popular and
344.96,3.989,the responsive in short time so this is
347.419,4.831,one of the important while you're
348.949,5.4,accessing anything any software the main
352.25,4.349,thing it has to response in within a
354.349,5.25,short time if suppose it is lagging
356.599,5.461,means whenever you enter a button if the
359.599,5.31,next page is opening it takes it takes
362.06,5.609,some time okay you it be it doesn't
364.909,4.741,becomes popular so when the software
367.669,4.081,becomes most popular if it's user
369.65,5.16,interface is responsive in short time
371.75,5.13,and if it user interface is clear to
374.81,5.09,understand so whenever the user
376.88,5.31,interface is attractive simple to use
379.9,4.69,responsive in short time clear to
382.19,4.11,understand then only you are software
384.59,6.38,that's software whatever
386.3,4.67,you're using that becomes most popular
391.09,12.87,so the user interface user interface is
397.099,10.801,broadly broadly divided into two
403.96,6.51,categories so generally the user
407.9,7.489,interface is divided into two categories
410.47,9.159,so the one is command line interface
415.389,7.71,command line interface so with the help
419.629,5.611,of the command line prompt that is the
423.099,4.451,command line prompt by you're you
425.24,4.41,interacting with the software as well as
427.55,4.079,the hardware so the user interface is
429.65,3.93,broadly divided into either command line
431.629,6.331,interface or you can go for the
433.58,6.239,graphical user interface so with the
437.96,4.29,help of the apps or with the help of
439.819,5.641,some list of features you can interact
442.25,5.879,directly with the software or hardware
445.46,4.47,by using graphical user interface so the
448.129,5.641,user interface may be command line
449.93,7.68,interface or graphical user interface so
453.77,5.989,this is about the user interface thank
457.61,2.149,you
