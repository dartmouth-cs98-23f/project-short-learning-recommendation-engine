second,duration,transcript
9.2,4.8,okay guys good morning okay so have
12.639,4.321,nothing for today
14.0,5.6,chapter 15 evaluation inspection
16.96,4.0,analytics and models
19.6,4.0,so aims
20.96,4.88,so describe the key concept i shaded
23.6,5.12,with the inspection methods
25.84,4.56,explain how to do heuristic evaluation
28.72,3.519,and walkthroughs
30.4,3.2,explain the role of analytics in
32.239,3.601,evaluation
33.6,6.08,describe house to you how to use speed
35.84,3.84,loss a predictive model
39.76,4.479,like so sometimes
41.36,4.64,it is not practical to involve user in
44.239,2.961,any evaluation because they are not
46.0,4.399,available
47.2,5.039,or there is insufficient time or it is
50.399,4.881,difficult to find people
52.239,6.96,so in such circumstances other people
55.28,5.68,often refer to us a expert or researcher
59.199,2.791,can provide feedback
60.96,2.079,these people are
61.99,2.809,[Music]
63.039,4.08,who are knowledgeable about both
64.799,4.561,interaction design and the needs and
67.119,4.641,typical behavior of user
69.36,5.28,various inspection methods for develop
71.76,5.44,alternatives to usability testing in the
74.64,4.799,early 1990s drawing on the software
77.2,4.48,engineering practice where code and
79.439,4.481,other type of inspection are commonly
81.68,2.24,used
84.159,5.041,the evaluation method described so far
86.88,3.84,in our previous lesson have involved
89.2,4.72,interaction
90.72,5.28,with or direct observation of user
93.92,4.72,so in this uh lesson we introduce
96.0,5.2,methods that are based on understanding
98.64,6.08,a user through knowledge codified in
101.2,6.879,heuristic or data collected remotely or
104.72,6.079,models that predict user performance so
108.079,5.121,none of this method required user to be
110.799,4.721,present during the evaluation
113.2,5.12,inspection methods typically involve an
115.52,4.32,expert role playing the user perform the
118.32,4.399,product's design
119.84,5.2,analyzing aspect of an interface and
122.719,6.16,identifying any potential usability
125.04,6.16,problem by using a set of guidelines
128.879,5.921,so the most well known are the heuristic
131.2,3.6,evaluation and the walkthroughs
134.879,4.881,analytics involved user interaction
137.2,4.8,lagging which usually done remotely so
139.76,5.36,predictive models involve analyzing the
142.0,5.2,various physical and mental operations
145.12,4.479,that are needed to perform a particular
147.2,6.0,task at the interface and operation
149.599,5.601,analyzing them as a quantitative measure
153.2,6.399,so one of the most commonly used
155.2,4.399,productivity model is the beats law
161.2,3.679,so heuristic evaluation
165.68,4.8,heuristic evaluation is a usability
168.0,7.04,inspection method that was
170.48,4.56,developed by nielsen and his colleague
175.2,4.0,and
176.319,6.0,later modified by other researchers or
179.2,5.92,evaluating specific types of system
182.319,6.321,so in heuristic evaluation expert guided
185.12,4.96,by a set of usability principle known as
188.64,3.12,a
190.08,3.04,heuristic
191.76,4.32,so
193.12,6.0,evaluate whether user interface elements
196.08,6.159,such as dialog box menus navigation
199.12,5.119,structure online health and so on
202.239,4.56,uh on point the tried and tested
204.239,5.36,principle so this heuristic closely
206.799,5.601,resemble high level design principle
209.599,5.36,sample making design consistent
212.4,5.839,reducing memory load and using terms
214.959,6.0,that user understand so the original
218.239,5.841,setup heuristic for atl evaluation was
220.959,5.121,developed by jacob nyonsen
224.08,6.32,and his colleague who derived the
226.08,7.76,apparently from the analysis of a 249
230.4,3.44,usability problem
236.08,5.76,so the vice version of nielsen regional
239.12,2.72,heuristic
242.319,5.2,first we have the visibility
244.959,5.28,of system status
247.519,5.041,so visibility of system status
250.239,3.441,the system should always keep user
252.56,3.519,informed
253.68,4.799,about what is going on through
256.079,3.68,appropriate feedback with reasonable
258.479,3.921,time
259.759,5.521,next we have um
262.4,6.079,match between system and the real world
265.28,5.44,so meaning um
268.479,5.841,the system should speak the user
270.72,6.479,language with words phrases and
274.32,5.04,concept familiar to the user rather than
277.199,4.641,system oriented terms
279.36,5.68,by the read word a convention making
281.84,5.359,information appear in a natural and a
285.04,3.599,logical order
287.199,4.481,then we have
288.639,5.84,user control and freedom
291.68,5.519,user control and freedom
294.479,5.361,users often choose system function by
297.199,5.121,mistake and will need a clearly marked
299.84,4.799,emergency exit to leave the unwanted
302.32,4.719,state without having to go through an
304.639,5.84,extended dialog box
307.039,7.041,example support of undo and
310.479,4.961,next we have the consistence consistency
314.08,3.44,and standard
315.44,4.64,so users should not have to wonder
317.52,4.56,whether different words situation or
320.08,4.16,action mean the same thing
322.08,6.08,uh
324.24,7.76,meaning follow the platform convention
328.16,3.84,then we have the error prevention
333.36,5.04,uh error prevention so even better than
335.84,4.639,good error message is a careful design
338.4,4.4,that prevent a problem from occurring in
340.479,4.72,the first place so either eliminate
342.8,3.6,error prone condition or
345.199,2.881,or check
346.4,4.72,more than a present user with a
348.08,5.2,confirmation option before they commit
351.12,5.6,to the action
353.28,6.72,then we have the recognition then recall
356.72,5.84,it means minimize the user memory load
360.0,3.68,by making objects action and option
362.56,3.28,visible
363.68,4.079,the user should not have to remember
365.84,3.68,information from one part of the
367.759,3.921,dialogue to another
369.52,5.679,instruction or use of system should be
371.68,5.519,visible or easily retrievable whether
375.199,4.481,whenever appropriate
377.199,5.361,then we have the flexibility and
379.68,5.84,efficiency of use
382.56,2.96,accelerators
385.6,3.599,so
386.4,5.2,unseen by the novice user may often
389.199,4.881,speed up the interaction for the expert
391.6,5.439,users such that the system can cater to
394.08,5.04,both inexperienced and experienced user
397.039,4.561,so meaning it allows users to tailor
399.12,3.6,frequent action
401.6,3.439,then
402.72,4.319,we have the aesthetic and
405.039,4.401,minimalist design
407.039,5.041,um
409.44,4.8,it means dialog box should not contain
412.08,5.36,information that is
414.24,6.72,irrelevant or rarely needed so every
417.44,5.84,extra unit of information in a dial.com
420.96,5.76,competes with the relevant units of
423.28,5.039,information and diminish their relative
426.72,4.0,visibility
428.319,6.241,next we have
430.72,4.8,help user recognize diagnose recover
434.56,3.52,from
435.52,2.56,errors
439.919,4.0,message should be
441.44,5.68,or error message should be expressed in
443.919,5.441,a plain language so meaning no codes so
447.12,6.639,precisely indicate the problem and
449.36,4.399,constructively suggest a solution
454.88,2.64,help
456.03,3.41,[Music]
457.52,4.72,help and documentation
459.44,4.879,so have an augmentation so even though
462.24,4.32,it is better if the system can be used
464.319,4.0,without documentation it may be
466.56,3.199,necessary to provide help and
468.319,3.761,augmentation
469.759,5.601,any such information should be easy to
472.08,5.6,search focus on the user tasks these
475.36,5.04,concrete steps to be carried out and not
477.68,3.84,to be too large before bleeding on
480.4,1.39,okay
481.52,1.84,so
481.79,2.77,[Music]
483.36,2.64,next
484.56,5.44,dial
486.0,5.039,so number of evaluators and wrap them
490.0,3.28,so
491.039,4.321,this heuristic uh
493.28,5.199,are intended to be used by judging
495.36,4.16,aspect of the interface against
498.479,3.361,them
499.52,5.359,for example uh if a new social
501.84,5.6,networking system is being evaluated
504.879,4.88,they the evaluator may consider how a
507.44,5.12,user would find find out how to add
509.759,4.72,brands to her network or to his network
512.56,4.399,so the evaluator is meant to go through
514.479,4.8,the interface several times inspecting
516.959,4.08,the barges interaction elements and
519.279,4.961,comparing them with the lease of
521.039,5.36,usability principle
524.24,3.84,for example heuristic
526.399,4.241,razor and each
528.08,5.84,iteration usability problem will be
530.64,6.24,identified other diagnosis will be
533.92,5.68,refined until
536.88,4.72,she or he is satisfied that the majority
539.6,5.2,of the
541.6,5.28,of the of them are clear
544.8,4.64,although many heuristics apply to the
546.88,5.12,most product example to be consistent
549.44,5.12,and provide meaningful feedback some of
552.0,5.6,the core heuristics are too general for
554.56,5.6,evaluating products that have come
557.6,4.96,come onto the market since nielsen and
560.16,4.48,mollich first develop the method
562.56,5.36,such as smartphones and other mobile
564.64,6.319,device digital toys online communities
567.92,5.359,ambient device and new web services
570.959,4.56,we also suggest developing categories
573.279,4.641,specific heuristics that apply the
575.519,4.561,specific class of prada as a supplement
577.92,4.72,to the general heuristic
580.08,4.319,evaluator and researcher
582.64,4.879,have therefore typically developed their
584.399,5.921,own heuristic by tailoring a nelson
587.519,4.481,heuristic with other design guidelines
590.32,4.24,market research and requirements
592.0,2.56,document
594.8,5.84,exactly with a heuristic are appropriate
598.48,5.039,and how many are needed for different
600.64,5.36,product is the debatable and depends on
603.519,4.961,the goals of the evaluation but most
606.0,5.279,sets of heuristics have been
608.48,4.72,have between 5 and 10 items
611.279,4.721,so this number provides a good range of
613.2,5.6,usability criteria by which to judge the
616.0,4.32,various aspect of the interface
618.8,3.599,more than 10 becomes difficult for
620.32,3.519,evaluators to remember
622.399,4.161,fewer
623.839,6.041,fewer than pythons not to be sufficient
626.56,3.32,and discriminating
630.0,4.72,a key question that is frequently asked
632.48,5.28,is how many evaluators
634.72,4.48,are needed to carry out two heuristic
637.76,3.92,evaluation
639.2,5.6,while one evaluator can identify a large
641.68,5.04,number of problems he or she may not
644.8,5.36,catch all of them
646.72,7.119,okay sure she may also have a tendency
650.16,6.0,to concentrate more on one aspect of
653.839,5.12,aspect at the expense of missing other
656.16,5.84,for example uh in the study of heuristic
658.959,6.0,valuation where 19 evaluators were asked
662.0,6.079,to find 16 usability problems in a voice
664.959,7.32,response system allowing the customer
668.079,4.2,access to their backup
675.279,2.401,nelson
676.48,2.799,found a
677.68,4.24,substantial difference between the
679.279,4.881,number and type of usability problem
681.92,4.8,found by the different evaluator
684.16,4.96,he also notes that while some usability
686.72,4.96,problems are very easy to find by all
689.12,5.04,evaluators there are some problems that
691.68,5.599,are found by very few experts
694.16,5.919,therefore he urged that it's important
697.279,5.441,to involve multiple evaluator in any
700.079,6.961,heuristic evaluation and recommends
702.72,6.16,between 3 and 5 evaluators
707.04,4.4,his findings suggest that
708.88,5.44,they can typically identify identify
711.44,4.079,around 75 percent of total disability
714.32,4.16,problem
715.519,5.76,as shown in our figure that's
718.48,2.799,said nothing
721.44,5.519,okay so however
723.76,5.519,employing multiple experts can be costly
726.959,6.241,skillful expert can capture many of the
729.279,6.401,usability problem by themselves and some
733.2,5.199,consultancies now use this technique as
735.68,3.92,the basis for critiquing interactive
738.399,3.761,products
739.6,5.6,a process that has become known as an
742.16,4.239,expert treaty or expert treat in some
745.2,4.8,countries
746.399,5.361,but using only one or two experts on the
750.0,4.8,heuristic evaluation
751.76,4.079,can be a problematic since research has
754.8,2.96,challenged
755.839,5.921,news and findings and question whether
757.76,6.639,even three to pipe evaluator is adequate
761.76,4.4,for example
764.399,3.841,carton and
766.16,3.919,woodridge
768.24,4.48,point out that the number of experts
770.079,5.361,needed to find 70 percent of problem
772.72,5.04,depends on the nature of the problems
775.44,5.199,their analysis of the problem frequency
777.76,6.319,and severity suggest that the highly
780.639,3.44,misleading findings can
785.44,2.48,so result
785.76,6.48,conclusion from this is that more is
787.92,6.8,better but more is also more expensive
792.24,3.839,okay so however
794.72,3.84,um
796.079,5.44,because user and special facilities are
798.56,4.959,not needed for heuristic evaluation and
801.519,4.641,it is a comparatively
803.519,5.201,inexpensive and quick it is popular with
806.16,5.679,developer and is often known
808.72,5.44,as a discount evaluation
811.839,4.721,so for a quick evaluation of an early
814.16,4.239,design one or two experts can probably
816.56,2.959,identify most potential disability
818.399,2.56,problem
819.519,3.68,but if a
820.959,4.961,total evaluation of a fully working
823.199,5.361,prototype is needed then having a team
825.92,4.4,or expert conducting table ratio and
828.56,4.48,comparing your findings would be
830.32,2.72,advisable
835.839,5.721,heuristic for websites focus on criteria
844.72,3.919,in the recent year
846.88,3.6,so considerable attention has been
848.639,3.76,purposed on the web
850.48,3.52,mobile apps and other digital
852.399,4.0,technologies
854.0,3.6,okay so here is orbital rating website
856.399,3.281,have become
857.6,3.919,increasingly important and several
859.68,3.36,slightly different setup heuristics have
861.519,3.841,been developed
863.04,3.919,a different sets of uh
865.36,4.4,mobile weighting website have been
866.959,4.0,developed based on news and original and
869.76,4.0,heuristic
870.959,5.841,one of this was developed by adibad
873.76,6.16,okay so after discovering that muslim
876.8,5.839,heuristic did not address a problem of a
879.92,5.2,continuously evolving web he also found
882.639,4.64,that there was an overlap between
885.12,3.519,several of the guidelines
887.279,3.12,and
888.639,4.88,that they varied widely in terms of
890.399,6.24,their scope and specificity which made
893.519,3.12,them difficult to use
897.199,3.601,okay so extra from the use of
898.959,4.32,development
900.8,5.76,that emphasize the web design issue
903.279,6.641,first we have the clarity
906.56,6.639,okay so clarity make the system as clear
909.92,5.359,concise and meaningful as possible for
913.199,5.121,the intended audience
915.279,5.201,write a clear concise copy only use
918.32,4.879,technical language for a technical
920.48,4.4,audience right clear and meaningful
923.199,5.841,meaningful labels
924.88,4.16,use meaningful icons
930.079,4.961,next we have um
931.92,6.08,minimize unnecessary complexity and
935.04,2.96,cognitive goal
939.6,5.599,so meaning make the system as simple as
942.72,4.96,possible for the user to accomplish
945.199,5.361,their tasks so remove unnecessary
947.68,5.92,functionality process step and visual
950.56,4.0,clutter use progressive disclosure to
953.6,2.56,hide
954.56,3.76,advanced feature
956.16,4.16,break down complicated processes into a
958.32,5.12,multiple step
960.32,6.959,prioritize using size shape color
963.44,6.0,alignment and proximity
967.279,4.641,then we have provide the user with the
969.44,4.88,context
971.92,5.039,okay so interface should provide user
974.32,5.04,with a sense of context in time and
976.959,2.401,space
979.519,7.281,provide a clear site name and purpose
983.36,3.44,highlight the current section
986.959,5.361,in the navigation provide a breadcrumb
989.519,7.12,trade use appropriate feedback message
992.32,4.319,show numbers of step in a process
998.24,3.839,reduce the
999.519,5.041,perception of the latency by providing
1002.079,5.12,visual cues example in progress
1004.56,6.079,indicator or by allowing user to
1007.199,6.0,complete other tasks while reading
1010.639,6.721,next we have promote positive and
1013.199,4.161,pleasurable user experience
1017.44,3.92,okay so
1018.959,4.081,the user should be treated with respect
1021.36,4.079,and the design should be
1023.04,5.759,aesthetically pleasing and promote a
1025.439,5.52,pleasurable and rewarding experience so
1028.799,5.12,create a pleasurable and attractive
1030.959,4.08,design provide easily attainable goals
1033.919,3.601,and
1035.039,5.28,provide rewards for the usage and
1037.52,2.799,progression
1041.199,6.801,so using heuristic bandwidth
1044.88,5.6,ambient display
1048.0,3.52,again so heuristic evaluation has also
1050.48,3.68,been used
1051.52,5.12,to evaluate abstract aesthetic
1054.16,4.879,peripheral display the portrait none
1056.64,4.24,critical information at the periphery of
1059.039,4.321,the user attention
1060.88,4.88,so since this device are not designed
1063.36,4.88,for past performance the researcher had
1065.76,3.919,to develop a set of heuristics that took
1068.24,3.84,this into account
1069.679,4.161,so they did this by developing two
1072.08,3.68,ambient display
1073.84,4.88,one indicated how to
1075.76,5.6,close a bus in the bus stop by showing
1078.72,6.24,its number move upward on the screen the
1081.36,5.76,other indicated how light or dark it was
1084.96,3.04,outside by lightening or darkening the
1087.12,1.919,light
1088.0,4.48,display
1089.039,5.52,so in our figure there are modified uh
1092.48,4.96,nielsen heuristic to address the
1094.559,4.801,characteristic of ambient display and as
1097.44,4.239,a group of experts to evaluate the
1099.36,4.4,display using them
1101.679,4.401,okay so the heuristic that they develop
1103.76,5.279,includes some that were specifically
1106.08,5.52,geared towards ambient systems such as
1109.039,4.961,visibility of state so the state of this
1111.6,5.36,space should be clear when it's placed
1114.0,5.12,in an intended setting
1116.96,3.92,peripherality of this place or the
1119.12,5.04,display should be
1120.88,5.36,an obtrusive and remains so unless it
1124.16,4.399,requires the user attention
1126.24,4.559,users should be able to easily monitor
1128.559,3.521,the display so in this study the
1130.799,2.401,researcher found out that a
1132.08,4.08,three-to-five
1133.2,6.8,evaluator were able to identify this 40
1136.16,5.2,to 60 percent of known usability issue
1140.0,3.36,in the valley of study different
1141.36,4.4,researchers used the same heuristic with
1143.36,4.8,different ambient application
1145.76,5.84,they found a 75 percent of known
1148.16,7.12,usability problems with the 8 evaluators
1151.6,6.079,and 35 to 55 were found with three to
1155.28,5.84,five evaluators suggesting that the more
1157.679,6.801,evaluator you have the more accurate the
1161.12,6.16,result will be as other researchers uh
1164.48,5.04,have also reported heuristic for other
1167.28,4.88,products adopted from instant original
1169.52,5.68,heuristic have continued to be developed
1172.16,5.12,and include heuristic for evaluating
1175.2,4.64,shared group wear
1177.28,4.24,video games multiplayer games and online
1179.84,5.76,communities
1181.52,4.08,and information visualization
1186.24,2.88,and
1186.84,4.76,[Music]
1189.12,5.6,eight golden rules of a set guideline
1191.6,5.68,first developed in the mid-1980s
1194.72,4.8,are also frequently adapted for use with
1197.28,5.68,the different types of system
1199.52,6.08,and environment and use as a heuristic
1202.96,5.36,or identifying usability problem
1205.6,4.319,so the first having a adidas eight night
1208.32,4.16,and golden rules
1209.919,4.88,uh strive for consistency
1212.48,5.12,so consistent sequence of action should
1214.799,5.36,be required in similar situation
1217.6,5.52,identical to terminology should be used
1220.159,5.321,in from minimums and help screen and
1223.12,4.64,consistent coder laid out
1225.48,4.199,capitalization points and so on should
1227.76,4.159,be employed
1229.679,4.081,exceptions such as record confirmation
1231.919,3.601,or delete commands or no
1233.76,3.68,echoing password should be
1235.52,4.399,comprehensible and
1237.44,4.96,limited in number
1239.919,4.481,next are catered to universal use
1242.4,4.639,usability
1244.4,5.2,meaning recognize the means of diverse
1247.039,4.481,users and design for
1249.6,4.559,plasticity and facilitating
1251.52,5.039,transformation of content so now buys to
1254.159,5.281,expert a different age range
1256.559,4.561,disabilities and technological diversity
1259.44,4.0,each energy and spectrums of
1261.12,4.4,requirements that guides design adding
1263.44,5.28,picture to numbers such as
1265.52,6.48,explanation and pictures for experts as
1268.72,5.439,shortcuts and password pacing can enrich
1272.0,6.08,the interface design and improve the
1274.159,4.721,purchases of system quality
1278.08,1.76,next
1278.88,2.72,offer
1279.84,4.319,informative feedback
1281.6,4.959,so for every user action there should be
1284.159,4.88,a system feedback for frequent and
1286.559,3.441,monitor action the response can be
1289.039,2.0,or less
1290.0,3.679,whereas
1291.039,5.601,for infrequent and major action the
1293.679,4.801,response should be more substantial
1296.64,4.08,visual presentation of object of
1298.48,4.48,interest provided a convenient
1300.72,3.68,environment for showing changes
1302.96,4.719,explicitly
1304.4,5.68,next we have the dialog a design dialog
1307.679,4.401,to yield a closure
1310.08,4.56,sequence of action should be organized
1312.08,4.479,into groups with the beginning middle
1314.64,4.48,and end
1316.559,5.36,informative feedback at the completion
1319.12,6.0,of group of action gives a operation the
1321.919,6.24,satisfaction of accomplishing a sense of
1325.12,6.0,relief a signal to drop contingency
1328.159,5.52,plans from the minds and an indicator to
1331.12,5.679,prepare for the next group of action for
1333.679,6.161,example ecommerce website will be user
1336.799,5.201,from selecting product will check out
1339.84,5.44,ending with a clear confirmation page to
1342.0,5.52,complete the transaction
1345.28,4.96,next we have prevent errors
1347.52,5.44,as much as possible we sign the systems
1350.24,5.919,uh such that user cannot make serious
1352.96,5.04,error for example gray out menu
1356.159,2.961,items that are not appropriate and do
1358.0,3.28,not allow
1359.12,4.96,alphabetic characters in numeric entry
1361.28,4.0,builds if a user makes an error the
1364.08,3.28,interface should
1365.28,4.48,detect the error and uh
1367.36,5.36,and offer simple constructive and
1369.76,6.159,specific instruction for recovery for
1372.72,5.92,example a user should not have to retype
1375.919,5.441,an entire name address from if they
1378.64,5.6,enter invalid zip code but rather should
1381.36,5.76,be guided to repair only the uh
1384.24,2.88,the quality part
1387.28,5.12,error action should leave the system
1389.76,5.039,state unchanged or the interface should
1392.4,3.519,give instruction about the restoring
1394.799,3.601,mistake
1395.919,3.521,next we have permit easy reversal of
1398.4,3.6,action
1399.44,6.479,as much as possible action should be
1402.0,3.919,reversible so this feature
1406.08,6.079,relieves anxiety since the user knows
1409.76,5.279,the errors can be unbanned
1412.159,3.921,and encourage exploration of unfamiliar
1415.039,3.361,option
1416.08,4.32,the units of reversibility may be a
1418.4,4.96,single action
1420.4,6.56,or data entry task or complete group of
1423.36,7.84,actions as entry of name address block
1426.96,4.24,next we have the support internal
1431.919,3.041,so experienced user
1434.08,3.28,uh
1434.96,4.959,strongly desired the sense that they are
1437.36,4.96,in charge of the interface and that the
1439.919,4.88,interface responds to their action
1442.32,4.719,they don't want a surprises or changes
1444.799,4.321,in familiar behavior and they are
1447.039,4.801,annoyed by
1449.12,5.84,reduced data entry sequence difficulty
1451.84,5.68,obtaining sr information and inability
1454.96,5.28,to produce their desired result
1457.52,4.159,last we have the reduce the short-term
1460.24,3.6,memory loads
1461.679,5.281,humans limit capacity for information
1463.84,6.0,processing in short-term memory
1466.96,2.88,is um
1470.32,3.839,that we can remember so
1476.24,4.16,so it requires a designer to avoid
1478.48,4.96,interfacing which user must remember
1480.4,5.519,information from one screen and then use
1483.44,4.96,the information on the other other
1485.919,4.321,screen it means that the smartphone
1488.4,3.279,should not require the entry of the
1490.24,4.24,phone numbers
1491.679,4.961,website location should remain visible
1494.48,4.4,multiple page display should be
1496.64,4.72,consolidated and sufficient training
1498.88,6.08,time should be allotted for complex
1501.36,3.6,sequence of action
1505.2,5.599,so three stages for doing heuristic
1508.0,2.799,evaluation
1511.84,3.52,doing heuristic evaluation can be broken
1514.159,3.601,down into
1515.36,4.48,into three main stages
1517.76,4.08,okay first is um
1519.84,5.439,the briefing session
1521.84,5.839,to tell experts what to do
1525.279,4.081,okay
1527.679,4.561,so
1529.36,5.76,a prepared script is useful as a guide
1532.24,4.72,and to ensure each person receive the
1535.12,4.559,same repeat
1536.96,5.76,then the evaluation period in which each
1539.679,5.201,expert typically spend one to two hours
1542.72,5.52,independently inspecting the product
1544.88,5.2,using a heuristic or guidance the expert
1548.24,3.439,needs to take at least two passes
1550.08,4.079,through the interface
1551.679,5.36,the first pass gives appeal for the flow
1554.159,5.201,of the interaction and the products fall
1557.039,5.12,the second pass allows the evaluator to
1559.36,5.199,propose a specific interface element in
1562.159,5.281,the context of the whole product and to
1564.559,6.081,identify potentially usability problem
1567.44,5.2,if the evaluation is for
1570.64,4.8,functioning product the evaluator need
1572.64,6.08,to save some specific user tasks in mind
1575.44,5.68,so that exploration is focused
1578.72,5.52,suggesting tasks may be helpful but many
1581.12,5.2,experts suggest their own tasks however
1584.24,5.84,this approach is less easy if the
1586.32,6.56,evaluation is done early in a design
1590.08,4.32,vendors are only screened map up or
1592.88,3.76,specification
1594.4,5.519,the approach needs to be adapted to the
1596.64,4.88,evaluation in circle circumstances
1599.919,4.561,while working through the interface
1601.52,5.68,specification or maps a second person
1604.48,4.96,may record the problem identified or the
1607.2,4.079,evaluator may think aloud
1609.44,4.16,alternatively she
1611.279,5.441,may take a note herself evaluator should
1613.6,6.8,be encouraged to be specific as possible
1616.72,5.52,and to record each problem clearly
1620.4,4.24,and
1622.24,5.12,that's the briefing session
1624.64,6.08,we session in which expert together to
1627.36,3.36,prioritize problem
1630.92,3.24,[Music]
1633.36,2.0,okay so
1634.16,3.36,[Music]
1635.36,4.16,they found i suggest a solution so the
1637.52,2.96,heuristic function of the evaluators
1639.52,3.44,attention
1640.48,4.4,on a particular issue so selecting
1642.96,4.959,appropriate heuristic is critically
1644.88,5.039,important so even though there are there
1647.919,4.88,is sometimes less agreement among
1649.919,5.601,evaluator that is
1652.799,4.721,is desirable as discussed
1655.52,4.72,in
1657.52,4.96,our next example okay there are fewer
1660.24,5.28,practical and ethical issues near
1662.48,6.16,evaluation uh than for other method
1665.52,5.84,because users are not involved
1668.64,5.519,a week is often cited as the time needed
1671.36,5.439,to train evaluator but this depends on
1674.159,4.561,the person's initial expertise so
1676.799,4.401,typical user can be taught to do
1678.72,4.88,heuristic evaluation although there have
1681.2,4.16,been range that this approach is not
1683.6,4.48,very successful
1685.36,7.76,a variation of this method is to take a
1688.08,5.04,team approach that may also involve user
1693.84,4.16,so advantages and right there
1700.32,3.44,okay so
1701.679,5.201,you might have been uh have the
1703.76,7.279,impression that heuristic evaluation is
1706.88,6.799,uh once a poor designer and it can
1711.039,5.601,reveal all the wrong with the design
1713.679,5.36,however it has a problems
1716.64,5.6,shortly after using evaluation was
1719.039,5.921,developed several independent studies
1722.24,6.159,compare urising evaluation with other
1724.96,5.36,methods particularly user testing
1728.399,4.481,they found that the different approaches
1730.32,5.359,often identify different problems and
1732.88,4.64,that sometimes heuristic evaluation is a
1735.679,4.081,severe problem
1737.52,4.32,so this urge for the using
1739.76,4.639,complementary methods
1741.84,5.36,furthermore heuristic evaluation should
1744.399,3.841,not be taught as a replacement for user
1747.2,3.76,testing
1748.24,5.36,another problem concerned expert
1750.96,4.16,reporting problems that don't exist in
1753.6,3.92,other words some of the expert
1755.12,4.159,predictions are wrong
1757.52,3.36,bailly's
1759.279,4.081,cite analysis
1760.88,5.039,from three published resources
1763.36,5.439,sources showing that only around 30
1765.919,5.281,percent of the problem reported were
1768.799,4.88,real usability problem
1771.2,3.68,some of which were serious others
1773.679,3.761,trivial
1774.88,5.84,however the heuristic evaluator missed
1777.44,6.16,about 20 percent of user problems
1780.72,5.52,furthermore about 43 percent of the
1783.6,4.72,problems identified by the expert were
1786.24,5.919,not problems at all
1788.32,6.239,okay so they were paul's alarm
1792.159,4.64,so bayless points out point out that
1794.559,5.441,this means only about half of the
1796.799,5.12,problem identifies our true problem
1800.0,4.559,more specifically for every true
1801.919,5.281,usability problem identified there will
1804.559,5.441,be a little over pulse alarm
1807.2,4.32,one is two and about one half of the
1810.0,4.159,miss problem
1811.52,5.6,so in this analysis is true heuristic
1814.159,5.361,evaluators tend to identify more false
1817.12,4.559,alarms and miss more progress than they
1819.52,4.72,have through hits
1821.679,5.12,so the question is how can the number of
1824.24,3.76,wholesalers or mysterious problems be
1826.799,3.841,reduced
1828.0,4.399,so checking the expert really have uh
1830.64,4.56,the expertise that they have claimed
1832.399,5.52,would have but how can this be done
1835.2,5.199,so one way to overcome this problem is
1837.919,5.36,to have several evaluators
1840.399,5.28,so this helps to reduce the impact of
1843.279,5.921,one person experience or poor
1845.679,6.641,performance using heuristic evaluation
1849.2,7.12,along with user testing and other method
1852.32,4.0,is also a good idea
1857.76,4.96,one heuristic evaluation has proven to
1860.0,5.519,be very useful and used by many
1862.72,4.72,usability experts over the years the
1865.519,4.0,guidelines were designed to be applied
1867.44,4.88,to pc based application
1869.519,5.121,there were being developed in 1980s
1872.32,4.88,giving the range of current technologies
1874.64,5.84,examples smartphones and barges other
1877.2,3.28,mobile device tablet
1880.559,5.201,ambient system they have been developed
1882.96,5.68,since nielsen device his original sets
1885.76,5.84,up heuristic so it raises the question
1888.64,5.36,whether they can continue to be used to
1891.6,4.959,test usability and user experience with
1894.0,4.96,a new product for example
1896.559,5.12,how useful will they be for evaluating
1898.96,6.64,wearable technologies such as smart
1901.679,5.84,watches and augmented glasses
1905.6,4.64,so what are the heuristic might be
1907.519,5.201,needed there's also overlap between how
1910.24,4.48,evaluation heuristic and other kinds of
1912.72,4.4,design guidance are used
1914.72,4.959,design guidelines and often converted
1917.12,5.2,into heuristics so it is possible to use
1919.679,6.081,this instead or in combination with
1922.32,3.44,heuristic evaluation
1926.88,3.279,cognitive work tools
1930.24,4.88,okay so walkthroughs have been
1932.399,5.76,used by system developers for many years
1935.12,5.679,or inspecting code and other concept
1938.159,5.201,offers an alternative approach to reduce
1940.799,4.641,the heuristic evaluation or predicting
1943.36,3.76,user problems without
1945.44,3.359,user testing
1947.12,4.0,as the name suggests walkthroughs
1948.799,4.0,involves walking through a task with a
1951.12,4.32,product and
1952.799,4.561,nothing problematic usability feature
1955.44,3.52,most walkthrough methods do not involve
1957.36,3.76,users
1958.96,4.88,others such as pluralistic walkthroughs
1961.12,5.84,involves a team that may include user as
1963.84,5.76,well as the developer and disability
1966.96,2.64,specialist
1970.24,3.0,so
1988.48,3.76,i've got the doctors involved simulating
1990.64,3.919,the user problem
1992.24,4.319,uh solving process of each step in a
1994.559,3.921,human computer dialogue
1996.559,4.401,checking to see if the user goals and
1998.48,4.72,memory for action can be assumed to be
2000.96,4.48,the next correction action
2003.2,5.44,so the defining feature is that they
2005.44,6.4,focus on evaluating design or ease of
2008.64,6.159,learning a focus that is motivated by
2011.84,4.88,observing observation that users learn
2014.799,3.841,by exploration
2016.72,3.839,okay so the step involved in cognitive
2018.64,4.48,walkthroughs are
2020.559,2.561,we have the
2025.039,4.961,characteristic of typical user are
2027.12,5.2,identified and documented and sampled as
2030.0,4.799,are developed the focus on aspect of the
2032.32,5.199,design to be evaluated
2034.799,4.801,a description map up or prototype of the
2037.519,4.801,interface to be developed is also
2039.6,5.199,produced along with a clear sequence of
2042.32,6.079,action needed for the user to complete
2044.799,6.401,the task a designer and one of more
2048.399,4.72,expert evaluator come together to do the
2051.2,4.0,analysis
2053.119,4.641,the evaluator walk through the action
2055.2,5.28,sequence for each task placing it with
2057.76,4.56,the context of a typical scenario
2060.48,3.76,and as they do
2062.32,3.12,this they try to answer the following
2064.24,2.639,question
2065.44,3.52,okay first is
2066.879,4.0,will the correct action be sufficient
2068.96,5.36,evident to the user
2070.879,4.96,so or will the user know what to do to
2074.32,3.68,achieve the task
2075.839,3.84,so will the user notice that the correct
2078.0,4.48,action is available
2079.679,5.2,so meaning can user see the button or
2082.48,3.919,menu item that they should be used for
2084.879,5.76,the next action
2086.399,4.24,it is apparent when it's needed
2091.119,4.321,next will the user
2093.04,4.319,associate and interpret the response
2095.44,4.48,from the action correctly so meaning
2097.359,4.401,will the user know from the feedback
2099.92,4.08,that they have made or correct or
2101.76,5.359,incorrect choice of action in other
2104.0,5.359,words uh will the user know what to do
2107.119,4.641,see how to do it and understand from
2109.359,3.76,feedback whether the action was correct
2111.76,2.4,or not
2113.119,3.121,um
2114.16,3.84,as the walkthrough is being done a
2116.24,3.359,record of critical information is
2118.0,3.76,compiling which
2119.599,6.561,assumption about the uh would cause
2121.76,6.319,problem and why are identified
2126.16,4.88,so note about
2128.079,6.801,side issues and design changes are made
2131.04,6.079,a summary of a result is a compile okay
2134.88,6.0,next the design is the revise of the
2137.119,3.761,peaks of the problem presented
2142.079,2.641,so plus
2151.68,5.84,are other type of work tools
2154.96,5.52,in which user developers and usability
2157.52,4.88,experts work together to step through
2160.48,4.0,a task or scenario
2162.4,4.0,discussing usability issue associated
2164.48,4.4,with the diagonal elements
2166.4,5.84,involved in the scenario step
2168.88,5.6,in a pluralistic
2172.24,4.64,each of the evaluator is asked to assume
2174.48,4.48,the role of a typical user
2176.88,3.68,scenarios of use consisting of your
2178.96,4.159,prototype screen
2180.56,5.279,are given to each evaluator who
2183.119,4.96,writes down the sequence of action they
2185.839,4.321,should take to move from one string to
2188.079,5.681,another without uh
2190.16,5.6,comparing with bellow panelists
2193.76,4.0,when the panelists discuss the action
2195.76,5.04,they each asset just before moving to
2197.76,4.88,the next round of screen so this process
2200.8,3.84,continues until all the scenarios have
2202.64,4.719,been evaluated
2204.64,5.36,okay so the benefits of pluralistic work
2207.359,3.521,tools includes a strong focus on user
2210.0,3.52,tasks
2210.88,4.239,at a detailed level example looking at
2213.52,4.8,the step taken
2215.119,6.0,okay so this level of analysis analysis
2218.32,6.0,can be uh a valuable for certain kinds
2221.119,5.281,of systems such as safety critical ones
2224.32,4.88,whereas usability problem identified for
2226.4,6.24,a single step could be critical to its
2229.2,6.0,safety and efficiency
2232.64,5.28,the approach length incept will uh
2235.2,5.28,parasitic participatory design practices
2237.92,4.56,by involving multi-disciplinary team in
2240.48,4.16,which users play a key role
2242.48,5.44,furthermore the group brings a variety
2244.64,6.8,of expertise and opinions or
2247.92,5.679,interpreting each stage of interaction
2251.44,5.2,limitation includes having to get all
2253.599,5.601,the experts together at once and then
2256.64,4.959,proceed at the rate of the slowest
2259.2,4.48,furthermore only a limited number of
2261.599,3.841,scenarios and
2263.68,4.399,transports through the interface can
2265.44,5.639,usually be explored because of the time
2268.079,3.0,constraint
2272.48,4.4,evaluation using analytics
2278.32,4.0,so analytics is a method for evaluating
2281.359,3.281,user
2282.32,5.2,traffic through a system
2284.64,5.28,so mostly such system involved
2287.52,3.36,selling products or service
2289.92,3.36,uh
2290.88,4.64,so knowing what customers do and what is
2293.28,5.04,important for improving the product or
2295.52,4.599,service but analytics are also being
2298.32,5.2,used for evaluating
2300.119,3.401,non-transactional system
2303.839,5.361,when used to examine a topic on a
2305.839,5.76,website or part of the website
2309.2,4.96,as i mentioned in
2311.599,5.121,lesson in chapter seven the analytics
2314.16,5.12,are known as web analytics
2316.72,4.56,web analytics can be collected locally
2319.28,3.92,or remotely across the internet by
2321.28,4.799,lagging user activity
2323.2,4.96,counting and analyzing the data in order
2326.079,4.401,to understand what part of the website
2328.16,4.88,are being used and when
2330.48,5.2,all the analytics are from
2333.04,4.799,our form of evaluation that is
2335.68,4.96,particularly useful for evaluating the
2337.839,4.961,visibility of a website they are also
2340.64,5.12,valuable for business planning including
2342.8,6.16,the business of online education
2345.76,6.319,recently analytics have been applied to
2348.96,4.639,understand how learners in massive open
2352.079,3.201,online courses
2353.599,4.081,and other web buys
2355.28,4.24,web-based education courses interact
2357.68,3.84,with this system
2359.52,3.2,for example the developers of this
2361.52,5.2,system are
2362.72,6.879,interested in that as such question as
2366.72,5.359,why do learners enroll in this system
2369.599,3.76,and what point do learners tend to drop
2372.079,3.201,out and why
2373.359,4.081,what are the characteristics of learners
2375.28,4.319,who complete the course compared with
2377.44,4.32,those who do not complete it
2379.599,4.641,so
2381.76,4.64,now so many companies are developing
2384.24,4.4,their own analytics tools
2386.4,4.959,other use of the service of companies
2388.64,4.0,such as google and
2391.359,2.881,vice
2392.64,4.56,so which uh
2394.24,5.52,specialize in providing analytics and
2397.2,4.56,the analysis necessary to understand
2399.76,3.92,large volume of data
2401.76,4.24,typically these
2403.68,4.56,companies present their analysis in
2406.0,4.8,forms that are easy to devel for
2408.24,5.68,developers and website a manager to
2410.8,4.08,understand for example in graphs tables
2413.92,4.159,and
2414.88,6.76,other types of data visualization
2418.079,6.881,the homepage of pcstat or
2421.64,5.4,pricestat.com so contains a short uh
2424.96,4.56,promotional video describing the hints
2427.04,4.24,of services that the company offers and
2429.52,3.28,why these services are important to
2431.28,4.24,businesses
2432.8,5.279,an example of how web analytics can be
2435.52,4.799,used to analyze and help developers to
2438.079,6.401,improve our website performance is
2440.319,5.841,provided by that analysis
2444.48,3.839,okay so
2446.16,5.12,example okay
2448.319,6.241,uh mountain wines okay
2451.28,5.92,uh it's located in saratoga california
2454.56,5.2,so it aims to create a memorable
2457.2,3.76,experience for guests who visit the
2459.76,3.68,barnyard
2460.96,4.24,so following on the traditional started
2463.44,4.639,by paul mason
2465.2,6.399,world famous winemaker
2468.079,5.76,mountain wines offers a beautiful venue
2471.599,4.881,for a variety of events including
2473.839,6.321,weddings corporate meetings dinner
2476.48,6.24,parties birthday concert and vacation so
2480.16,4.88,mountain vines uses a variety
2482.72,6.72,of advertising media to attract
2485.04,8.079,customers to its website and in 2010
2489.44,7.44,invest invested about
2493.119,6.0,thousand dollar a month in advertising
2496.88,4.56,however the website has remained
2499.119,5.041,unchanged for several years because the
2501.44,4.639,company didn't have a way of evaluating
2504.16,4.159,its effectiveness and could not decide
2506.079,4.24,whether to increase or decrease the
2508.319,5.28,investment in
2510.319,5.921,the they then decide to employ
2513.599,5.201,a business staff to use their web
2516.24,4.879,analytics tools prior to the in
2518.8,4.0,this thing this company the only record
2521.119,3.521,that mountain once had
2522.8,4.319,of the effectiveness of itself
2524.64,4.0,advertising came from the front desk
2527.119,3.601,employees who were
2528.64,5.199,instructed to ask visitor how did you
2530.72,4.96,hear about mountain lions
2533.839,4.24,so obviously that
2535.68,5.04,provided mountain wines with data
2538.079,5.601,showing how their website was being used
2540.72,4.639,by potential customer example you
2543.68,3.04,get a like that's showing
2545.359,2.161,your
2546.72,6.08,uh
2547.52,7.2,nothing figure 15.4 and for 15.5
2552.8,5.039,provides an overview of the number of
2554.72,5.52,page view of the website per day
2557.839,5.441,so you speak your pinpoint will provide
2560.24,5.359,additional details and show the hours by
2563.28,4.96,our traffic so clicking on the first
2565.599,5.681,icon for the details show where the ip
2568.24,3.92,address of the traffic are located
2571.28,3.36,so
2572.16,5.04,visit us can also provide information
2574.64,5.12,about such thing as which visitor are
2577.2,5.44,new to the site which are with uh
2579.76,3.92,returners and which other pages visitors
2582.64,4.16,came from
2583.68,5.84,so using this data and data provided by
2586.8,6.08,visit staff mountain ones could see
2589.52,5.92,visitor totals and traffic's average
2592.88,5.68,traffic sources traffic visitor activity
2595.44,7.52,and more we discovered uh the importance
2598.56,6.88,of visibility for the top search words
2602.96,4.8,they could pinpoint where guests were
2605.44,4.08,going on their website and they could
2607.76,6.24,see where their guests were
2609.52,4.48,geographically geographically located
2616.0,4.72,social analysis
2618.4,4.719,so more recently other types of
2620.72,4.0,specialist analytics have also been
2623.119,3.441,developed such as
2624.72,3.44,visual analytics
2626.56,4.24,in which thousands and sometimes
2628.16,6.32,millions of data points are displayed
2630.8,4.799,and manipulated visually
2634.48,4.0,such as
2635.599,5.441,social network analysis
2638.48,4.96,example so light logging is another
2641.04,5.12,interesting variation that can be used
2643.44,5.76,for evaluation as well as for sharing
2646.16,4.32,information with friends family and
2649.2,3.84,colleagues
2650.48,5.28,so typically live lagging involves
2653.04,5.76,recording gps location
2655.76,4.72,data and personal interaction data on
2658.8,3.92,smartphones
2660.48,4.8,in an evaluation context this can raise
2662.72,5.04,privacy concern even though users tend
2665.28,6.0,to get used to being that they generally
2667.76,6.0,want to remain in a control of lagging
2671.28,3.559,so this
2673.76,4.8,dilemma
2674.839,7.161,analyzing uh social networking behavior
2678.56,6.24,sub invasion of privacy so some analytic
2682.0,5.92,software can be used by it administrator
2684.8,6.4,to track a worker's behavior on social
2687.92,5.36,networking site during working hours
2691.2,5.119,and the data collect that can be used to
2693.28,5.839,determine who is collaborating with room
2696.319,5.52,and to inform developers about how much
2699.119,5.441,of their application are being used
2701.839,4.161,or concept often referred to as
2704.56,4.08,stickiness
2706.0,5.119,so while this reason per tracking user
2708.64,4.16,appeared to be a bona pipe so this is a
2711.119,5.2,threat to
2712.8,3.519,personal privacy
2716.96,4.8,uh using web analytics again so there
2719.44,5.36,are two types of web analytics on-site
2721.76,5.2,and off-site analytics
2724.8,4.16,so your on-site analytics are used by
2726.96,3.04,website owners to measure booster
2728.96,4.08,behavior
2730.0,5.359,new upside measure a website visibility
2733.04,4.72,and potential to acquire an audience on
2735.359,5.441,the internet regardless of the who owns
2737.76,4.8,the website so in recent years
2740.8,4.08,however the difference between upside
2742.56,4.48,and on-site analytics has learned but
2744.88,4.32,some people still use this term
2747.04,4.0,additional sources may also be used to
2749.2,5.2,augment the data collected about a
2751.04,5.36,website such as an email direct mail
2754.4,4.4,campaign details
2756.4,5.199,data sales and history
2758.8,4.799,data which can be paired with a
2761.599,4.48,web traffic data to provide further
2763.599,5.041,insight into the user behavior
2766.079,5.841,example are they in google analytics
2768.64,6.959,even as early as 2012 google analytics
2771.92,6.64,was analytics was the most widely used
2775.599,3.921,on the site web analytics and statistics
2778.56,3.519,service
2779.52,6.48,more than 50 percent of the
2782.079,6.561,10 000 most popular website at that time
2786.0,4.319,use google analytics and its popularity
2788.64,2.63,continues to soar
2790.319,2.881,um
2791.27,4.73,[Music]
2793.2,4.8,shows part of google analytics for compa
2796.0,4.72,how home buying
2798.0,4.119,website for the previous edition of this
2800.72,4.399,book
2802.119,5.561,ideabook.com for the week uh starting at
2805.119,5.521,the end of the november 2018 until the
2807.68,6.0,beginning of december 2018.
2810.64,7.199,okay so it's 17 of popular analytics
2813.68,4.159,nothing in google analytics delay so
2818.4,4.8,since 2012
2820.24,5.119,so in addition to google analytics other
2823.2,5.2,tools continue to emerge that provide
2825.359,5.601,additional layers of information
2828.4,5.84,so good access control option enroll in
2830.96,5.359,real-time data collection
2834.24,4.48,uh most analytics
2836.319,5.201,including another type we should trust
2838.72,4.96,search marketing social media marketing
2841.52,4.48,and brand activity links and content
2843.68,4.32,marketing and it's particularly useful
2846.0,4.48,for leak management and analysis
2848.0,4.96,analysis so you
2850.48,6.599,are most analytics now then what
2852.96,4.119,initially visits www.moss.com
2858.0,3.599,also have the
2859.28,4.799,through social metrics
2861.599,5.281,uh autonomous attracts social media
2864.079,4.161,metrics and helps calculate social media
2866.88,2.4,marketing
2868.24,5.079,okay
2869.28,4.039,so you're gonna type send
2876.88,5.12,general record website visitor action
2879.599,5.96,and uses meta statistic to create this
2882.0,3.559,file shipment
2886.72,3.44,predictive models
2889.2,3.2,okay
2890.16,5.199,so similar to inspection methods and
2892.4,5.919,analytics predictive models evaluate a
2895.359,4.801,system without user being present
2898.319,4.321,so rather than involving expert
2900.16,5.36,evaluator role-playing user as
2902.64,5.28,inspection or tracking their behavior
2905.52,5.039,as in analytics predicted models use
2907.92,4.48,formulas to derive values measure of
2910.559,4.641,user performance
2912.4,5.439,predictive modeling provide estimate of
2915.2,5.28,the efficiency of different system for
2917.839,4.961,various kinds of tasks for example a
2920.48,5.359,smartphone designer may choose to use
2922.8,5.68,predictive model because it can enable
2925.839,5.52,her to determine accurately
2928.48,5.2,which is optimal layout of keys on the
2931.359,3.601,phone for allowing common operation to
2933.68,2.96,be performed
2934.96,5.84,so two types of predictive models have
2936.64,6.64,been particularly influential in hci
2940.8,5.92,and interaction design over uh over the
2943.28,8.0,years the pitch though which
2946.72,7.119,we will discuss really in the next slide
2951.28,6.16,and the goms or
2953.839,6.081,goms it up models which are rarely used
2957.44,5.919,now as a tool were designed in the early
2959.92,5.76,1980s primarily for comparing pc-based
2963.359,4.96,interface for tasks that were highly
2965.68,2.639,predictable
2969.04,3.2,always a defeats here
2972.72,5.04,so the pit's law
2975.2,4.96,predicts the time it takes to reach a
2977.76,4.559,target using pointing device
2980.16,4.72,so it was originally used in human
2982.319,4.8,factor research to model the
2984.88,5.04,relationship between the speed and
2987.119,4.161,accuracy when moving towards a target on
2989.92,3.36,a display
2991.28,4.72,in the interaction design it has been
2993.28,5.279,used to describe the time it takes
2996.0,5.2,to point at the target based on the size
2998.559,3.841,of the object and the distance to the
3001.2,3.2,object
3002.4,4.0,specifically it is used to model the
3004.4,2.88,time it takes to select object on the
3006.4,3.199,screen
3007.28,4.16,such as alpha geometric or different
3009.599,4.161,spatial configuration
3011.44,4.8,one of its main benefits that
3013.76,5.839,it can help designer decide whether to
3016.24,5.52,locate physical or digital button what
3019.599,4.24,size they should be and how close
3021.76,5.2,together they should be on a touch
3023.839,6.081,display or physical device to begin with
3026.96,4.159,it was most useful for designing
3029.92,4.88,physical
3031.119,5.521,laptop or pc keyboards layouts and the
3034.8,4.4,placement of physical keys on mobile
3036.64,5.52,devices such as smartphone
3039.2,5.28,watches and remote controls
3042.16,4.88,since lenses have been used more for
3044.48,5.359,designing the layout of digital input
3047.04,4.64,displayport touch screen interfaces
3049.839,4.321,especially for considering the
3051.68,5.2,effectiveness of the new ways of single
3054.16,4.88,digit typing such as using
3056.88,5.199,fingers or swiping
3059.04,6.24,so the bigger the target the easier
3062.079,6.161,and quicker it is to reach
3065.28,5.6,this is why interface have a big buttons
3068.24,5.119,are easier to use than interface that
3070.88,4.959,presents lots of tiny buttons clamps
3073.359,2.48,together
3075.92,4.72,it's though also pretty
3077.839,5.041,but the most quickly access target on
3080.64,4.8,any computer display are the four
3082.88,4.16,corners of the screen this uh this is
3085.44,4.32,because of their
3087.04,4.64,uh pinning action example the side of
3089.76,4.4,the display constraint the user from
3091.68,5.6,over stepping the target
3094.16,6.72,however as pointed out by thug
3097.28,6.319,on his asphalt.com website
3100.88,4.88,corners seems strangely to be avoided at
3103.599,4.641,all costs by the designer
3105.76,5.12,it still can be useful for evaluating
3108.24,6.24,system where the time to physical locate
3110.88,5.679,an object is critical to a pass at hand
3114.48,4.4,in particular it can help designer to
3116.559,5.04,think about where to locate object on
3118.88,5.199,the screen in relation to each other
3121.599,4.881,these are specially useful for mobile
3124.079,4.881,device where there is a limited space
3126.48,3.52,for placing icons and buttons on the
3128.96,3.28,screen
3130.0,3.44,for example in the study carried out by
3132.24,4.48,nokia
3133.44,7.28,pixel was used to predict expert
3136.72,6.56,expert texts uh enter rates for server
3140.72,3.76,inputs methods on 12t cell phone key
3143.28,3.44,file
3144.48,5.2,the study has the designer to make
3146.72,6.0,decision about the size of the key their
3149.68,5.12,positioning and the sequence of presses
3152.72,4.56,to perform common dust
3154.8,4.48,trade-offs between the size of a device
3157.28,3.68,and accuracy of using
3159.28,3.44,it were made
3160.96,3.119,with the help of the calculation from
3162.72,4.24,this model
3164.079,5.52,pits law have also been used to compare
3166.96,4.32,eye tracking input with manual input for
3169.599,4.72,visual target
3171.28,5.36,so to compare different ways of mapping
3174.319,3.76,a chinese character to the keyboard of
3176.64,3.919,cell phones
3178.079,4.881,and and also to investigate the backup
3180.559,4.401,the size of physical gap between display
3182.96,6.399,and proximity of targets in multiple
3184.96,7.44,display environment and it also used to
3189.359,5.841,evaluate tilt as an input method or
3192.4,5.199,device with built in accelerometers such
3195.2,3.68,as touchscreen phones and tablet's
3197.599,2.72,computer
3198.88,4.08,so the us
3200.319,4.8,ask.com website also discuss
3202.96,4.32,the application of its law to
3205.119,6.0,smartphones and other new technologies
3207.28,3.839,with limited screen real estate
3216.559,4.0,some key point inspection can be used to
3218.8,4.319,evaluate requirements markup and
3220.559,4.881,functional prototype subsystem
3223.119,4.96,user testing heuristic evaluation may
3225.44,4.879,reveal different usability of problem
3228.079,3.681,design guidelines can be used to develop
3230.319,4.0,your listing
3231.76,5.12,walkthroughs are focused so are suitable
3234.319,5.441,reading small parts of products and
3236.88,6.16,analytics involve collecting data user
3239.76,5.12,activity of a website
3243.04,4.96,so
3244.88,5.6,in our lessons or in this lesson
3248.0,5.359,i presented inspection evaluation method
3250.48,5.52,focusing heuristic evaluation and work
3253.359,3.521,which are usually done by your
3256.0,2.48,your
3256.88,4.08,specialist
3258.48,4.96,usually you refer to an expert
3260.96,4.639,who roll these user
3263.44,4.8,with the design and prototypes in a
3265.599,4.161,specification using their substantial
3268.24,4.64,knowledge the kinds of problems that
3269.76,4.48,users typically encounter and then offer
3272.88,3.28,their opinion
3274.24,4.16,so here is the evaluation and workforce
3276.16,4.959,offer evaluator a structure
3278.4,5.6,to guide the evaluation process
3281.119,5.041,and analytics um
3284.0,5.359,in which user interaction are logged are
3286.16,6.48,often performed remotely and without a
3289.359,6.161,user being aware that their interaction
3292.64,4.24,rv income so very large of volume data
3295.52,3.92,are collected
3296.88,4.08,anonymized and static statistically
3299.44,4.159,analyze using
3300.96,4.56,specially developed software services
3303.599,5.121,so the analysis provides information
3305.52,5.279,about how a system is used example how
3308.72,4.48,different version of website or
3310.799,4.721,prototype performed or which part of a
3313.2,4.879,website are standard news possibly due
3315.52,3.68,to the port usability design or lack of
3318.079,2.72,appeal
3319.2,4.08,data are often
3320.799,5.681,presented visually so that it it is
3323.28,4.96,easier to see trends and interprets and
3326.48,4.56,results
3328.24,4.879,lastly pete's law is an example of a
3331.04,5.36,technique that can be used to predict
3333.119,6.081,user performance but determining whether
3336.4,4.8,a proposed interface system or a keypad
3339.2,4.399,layout will be optimized
3341.2,4.24,typically pizzle is used for
3343.599,3.921,use to
3345.44,4.879,compare different design up layouts for
3347.52,5.36,virtual or physical objects such as both
3350.319,5.121,on on a device or screen for small
3352.88,5.84,sequence of frequent nipple compass so
3355.44,6.32,evaluators typically find that they have
3358.72,4.8,modified this metal core valuation with
3361.76,4.4,the market since speed slow was
3363.52,4.96,originally developed that is similar to
3366.16,3.679,the other methods discussed
3368.48,4.48,in our
3369.839,5.441,earlier lesson which frequently also
3372.96,4.879,have to be modified
3375.28,5.559,okay so that's it for today and thank
3377.839,3.0,you
