4.497,2.67,"SPEAKER: Welcome back,
future data analyst."
7.167,3.81,"As a budding analyst, you'll
be exposed to a lot of data."
10.977,3.91,"People learn and absorb data
in so many different ways,"
14.887,3.08,"and one of the most effective
ways that this can happen"
17.967,1.74,is through visualization.
19.707,3.33,"Data visualization is the
graphic representation"
23.037,2.01,and presentation of data.
25.047,2.52,"In reality, it's just
putting information"
27.567,3.96,"into an image to make it easier
for other people to understand."
31.527,2.13,"If you've ever looked
at any kind of map,"
33.657,2.827,"whether it's paper
or online, then you"
36.484,3.053,"know exactly how
helpful visuals can be."
39.537,1.77,"Data visualizations
are definitely"
41.307,1.62,having a moment right now.
42.927,3.66,"Online we are surrounded by
images that show information"
46.587,2.08,in all kinds of ways.
48.667,1.76,"But the history of
data visualization"
50.427,2.46,"goes back way
further than the web."
52.887,3.42,"Visualizing data began
long ago with maps,"
56.307,1.86,"which are the visual
representation"
58.167,1.32,of geographic data.
59.487,3.39,"This map of the known
world is from 1502."
62.877,3.18,"Mapmakers continue to
improve their visualizations"
66.057,2.73,"as new lands were
charted, new data"
68.787,2.04,"was collected about
those locations,"
70.827,3.54,"and new methods for visualizing
the data were created."
74.367,2.43,"Scientists and
mathematicians began"
76.797,2.94,"to truly embrace the idea
of arranging data visually"
79.737,2.73,in the 1700s and 1800s.
82.467,3.3,This bar graph is from 1821.
85.767,2.52,"And it doesn't look too
different from bar graphs"
88.287,1.14,that we see today.
89.427,2.4,"But since the beginning
of the digital age"
91.827,3.96,"of Data Analytics in the
1990s, the scope and reach"
95.787,1.83,"of visualizations
have grown along"
97.617,1.89,"with the data they
graphically represent."
99.507,2.94,"As we keep learning how to
more efficiently communicate"
102.447,4.62,"with visuals, the quality of our
insights continue to grow too."
107.067,3.51,"Today, we can quantify
human behavior through data."
110.577,3.04,"And we've learned to use
computers to collect, analyze,"
113.617,1.46,and visualize that data.
115.077,2.19,"As an analyst in
today's world, you'll"
117.267,2.94,"probably split your time with
data visuals in two ways,"
120.207,2.58,"looking at visuals in order
to understand and draw"
122.787,4.29,"conclusions about data, or
creating visuals from raw data"
127.077,1.2,to tell a story.
128.277,2.46,"Either way, it's
always good to keep"
130.737,3.87,"in mind that data visualizations
will be your key to success."
134.607,2.97,"This is especially true once
you reach the point where you're"
137.577,2.61,"ready to present the results
of your data analysis"
140.187,1.02,to an audience.
141.207,3.09,"Getting people to understand
your vision and thought process"
144.297,3.54,"can feel challenging, but a
well-made data visualization"
147.837,2.31,"has the power to
change people's minds."
150.147,2.64,"Plus, it can help
someone who doesn't"
152.787,2.94,"have the same technical
background or experience as you"
155.727,2.28,form their own opinions.
158.007,2.64,"So here's a quick rule for
creating a visualization."
160.647,2.46,"Your audience should
know exactly what"
163.107,1.84,"they're looking at
within the first five"
164.947,1.46,seconds of seeing it.
166.407,2.16,"Basically, this means
the visual should"
168.567,1.71,be clear and easy to follow.
170.277,2.85,"And the five seconds
after that, your audience"
173.127,2.91,"should understand the conclusion
your visualization is making,"
176.037,2.7,"even if they aren't totally
familiar with the research"
178.737,1.17,you've been doing.
179.907,2.62,"They might not agree with your
conclusion, and that's OK."
182.527,1.52,"You can always
use their feedback"
184.047,2.58,"to adjust your visualization
and go back to the data"
186.627,1.84,to do further analysis.
188.467,1.61,"So now let's talk
about what we have"
190.077,2.01,"to do to create a
visualization that's"
192.087,4.05,"understandable, effective, and
most importantly, convincing."
196.137,1.68,Let's start from the beginning.
197.817,2.16,"Data visualizations
are a helpful tool"
199.977,2.85,"for fitting a lot of
information into a small space."
202.827,2.73,"To do this, you first need
to structure and organize"
205.557,0.78,your thoughts.
206.337,2.64,"Think about your objectives
and the conclusions"
208.977,2.46,"you've reached after
sorting through data."
211.437,1.98,"Then, think about
the patterns you've"
213.417,2.76,"noticed in the data, the
things that surprised you,"
216.177,2.46,"and of course, how all
of this fits together"
218.637,1.26,into your analysis.
219.897,2.82,"Identifying the key
elements of your findings"
222.717,2.04,"helps set the stage
for how you should"
224.757,1.77,organize your presentation.
226.527,1.98,"Check out this
data visualization"
228.507,3.72,"made by David McCandless, a
well-known data journalist."
232.227,3.57,"This graphic includes four
key elements, the information"
235.797,5.52,"or data, the story, the
goal, and the visual form."
241.317,3.45,"It's arranged in a four part
Venn diagram which tells us"
244.767,1.68,"that all four
elements are needed"
246.447,2.38,for successful visualization.
248.827,1.76,"So far you've learned
a lot about the data"
250.587,1.41,used in visualizations.
251.997,2.28,"That's important because
it's a key building"
254.277,1.92,block for your visualization.
256.197,3.15,"The story or concept
adds meaning to the data"
259.347,1.29,and makes it interesting.
260.637,2.49,"We'll talk more about the
importance of data storytelling"
263.127,2.25,"later, but for
now, just remember"
265.377,3.21,"that the story and the data
combined provide an outline"
268.587,1.38,of what you're trying to show.
269.967,4.46,"The goal or function makes the
data both useful and usable."
274.427,4.02,"And the visual form creates
both beauty and structure."
278.447,1.86,"With just two elements,
you can create"
280.307,1.86,a rough sketch of a visual.
282.167,2.92,"This could work if
you're at an early stage"
285.087,2.39,"but won't give you a complete
visualization because you'd"
287.477,1.71,be missing other key elements.
289.187,2.4,"Even using three
elements gets you closer,"
291.587,1.8,but you're not quite finished.
293.387,3.63,"For example, if you
combined information, goal,"
297.017,2.76,"and visual form
without any story,"
299.777,1.56,"your visual will
probably look fine,"
301.337,1.83,but it won't be interesting.
303.167,4.41,"On their own, each element has
value, but visualizations only"
307.577,2.64,"become truly powerful
and effective when"
310.217,3.49,"you combine all four elements
in a way that makes sense."
313.707,2.21,"And when you think about
all these elements together,"
315.917,3.54,"you can create something
meaningful for your audience."
319.457,3.0,"At Google, I make sure
to develop visualizations"
322.457,3.09,"to tell stories about
data that include all four"
325.547,1.18,of these elements.
326.727,2.69,"And I can tell you that
each element is a key"
329.417,2.02,to a visualization success.
331.437,3.68,"That's why it's so important
for you, as the analyst,"
335.117,3.66,"to pay close attention to each
element as we move forward."
338.777,2.37,"Other people might
not know or understand"
341.147,3.86,"the exact steps you took to come
to the conclusions you've made,"
345.007,2.16,"but that shouldn't stop
them from understanding"
347.167,1.26,your reasoning.
348.427,2.49,"Basically, an effective
data visualization"
350.917,2.49,"should lead viewers to
reach the same conclusion"
353.407,2.31,you did but much more quickly.
355.717,2.04,"Because of the age
we live in, we're"
357.757,1.83,"constantly being
shown different ways"
359.587,2.41,to view and absorb information.
361.997,1.55,"This means that
you've already seen"
363.547,2.13,"lots of visuals you
can reference as you"
365.677,1.74,design your own visualizations.
367.417,2.31,"You have the power to tell
convincing stories that"
369.727,3.09,"can change opinions
and shift mindsets."
372.817,1.59,That's pretty cool.
374.407,1.83,"But you also have
the responsibility"
376.237,2.79,"to pay attention to the
perspectives of others"
379.027,2.1,as you create these stories.
381.127,2.85,"So it's important to
always keep that in mind."
383.977,2.73,"Coming up, we'll start
drawing connections"
386.707,4.05,"between data and images to
create a strong foundation"
390.757,2.13,for your visual masterpieces.
392.887,1.245,I can't wait to get started.
396.832,3.339,[MUSIC PLAYING]
401.607,2.79,"Earlier, we talked about
why data visualizations"
404.397,3.76,"are so important to both
analysts and stakeholders."
408.157,1.64,"Now we'll discuss
the connections"
409.797,3.81,"you can make between data and
images in your visualizations."
413.607,3.33,"Visual communication of
data is important to those"
416.937,2.79,"using the data to
help make decisions."
419.727,2.52,"To better understand the
connection between data"
422.247,2.61,"and images, let's talk
about some examples of data"
424.857,3.87,"visualizations and how they can
communicate data effectively."
428.727,3.21,"You've maybe come across lots
of these in your daily life,"
431.937,2.65,"and we'll explore them
a little bit more here."
434.587,2.19,"A good place to
start is a bar graph."
436.777,4.55,"Bar graphs use size contrast
to compare two or more values."
441.327,2.19,"The horizontal line
of a bar graph,"
443.517,3.75,"usually placed at the
bottom, is called the X-axis."
447.267,2.56,"In bar graphs with
vertical bars,"
449.827,3.86,"the x-axis is used to represent
categories, time periods,"
453.687,1.32,or other variables.
455.007,1.86,"The vertical line
of a bar graph,"
456.867,3.76,"usually placed to the
left, is called the y-axis."
460.627,4.53,"The y-axis usually has a scale
of values for the variables."
465.157,2.24,"In this example,
the time of day is"
467.397,2.28,"compared to someone's
level of motivation"
469.677,2.52,throughout the whole work day.
472.197,3.12,"Bar graphs are a great
way to clarify trends."
475.317,3.24,"Here, it's clear this
person's motivation"
478.557,1.5,"is low at the
beginning of the day"
480.057,4.23,"and gets higher and higher
by the end of the workday."
484.287,3.119,"This type of visualization
makes it very easy"
487.406,1.831,to identify patterns.
489.237,2.039,Another example is a line graph.
491.276,2.431,"Line graphs are a
type of visualization"
493.707,1.86,"that can help your
audience understand"
495.567,2.46,shifts or changes in your data.
498.027,2.04,"They're usually used
to track changes"
500.067,2.04,"through a period of
time, but they can be"
502.107,2.25,paired with other factors too.
504.357,2.97,"In this line graph
we're using two lines"
507.327,2.67,"to compare the popularity
of cats and dogs"
509.997,1.62,over a period of time.
511.617,2.34,"With two different
line colors, we"
513.957,3.18,"can immediately tell that dogs
are more popular than cats."
517.137,2.46,"We'll talk more about
using colors and patterns"
519.597,2.82,"to make visualizations more
accessible to audiences"
522.417,1.59,later too.
524.007,2.86,"Even as a line
moves up and down,"
526.867,2.03,there's a general trend upwards.
528.897,2.58,"And the line for dogs
always stays higher"
531.477,1.8,than the line for cats.
533.277,1.98,"Now let's check out
another visualization"
535.257,2.02,you'll probably recognize.
537.277,2.15,Say hello to the pie chart.
539.427,3.06,"Pie charts show how much
each part of something"
542.487,1.71,makes up the whole.
544.197,2.4,"This pie chart shows
us all the activities"
546.597,1.62,that make up someone's day.
548.217,2.25,"Half of it's spent
working, which"
550.467,3.75,"is shown by the amount of space
that the blue section takes up."
554.217,1.89,"From a quick scan,
you can easily"
556.107,2.25,"tell which activities
make up a good chunk"
558.357,4.32,"of the day in this pie chart and
which ones take up less time."
562.677,2.7,"Earlier, we learned how
maps help organize data"
565.377,1.02,geographically.
566.397,1.62,"The great thing
about maps is they"
568.017,2.55,"can hold a lot of
location-based information,"
570.567,3.18,"and they're easy for your
audience to interpret."
573.747,3.03,"This example shows survey
data about people's happiness"
576.777,0.9,in Europe.
577.677,1.86,"The borderlines
are well defined,"
579.537,2.25,"and the colors added
make it even easier"
581.787,1.83,to tell the countries apart.
583.617,1.8,"Understanding the
data represented"
585.417,2.4,"here, which we'll come
back to again later,"
587.817,2.38,can happen pretty quickly.
590.197,2.3,"So data visualization
is an excellent tool"
592.497,2.22,"for making the connection
between an image"
594.717,2.1,"and the information
it represents."
596.817,1.92,"But it can sometimes
be misleading."
598.737,2.49,"One way visualizations
can be manipulated"
601.227,2.16,is with scaling and proportions.
603.387,1.14,Think of a pie chart.
604.527,3.69,"Pie charts show proportions and
percentages between categories."
608.217,4.02,"Each part of the circle, or pie,
should reflect its percentage"
612.237,2.95,"to the whole, which
is equal to 100%."
615.187,2.6,"So if you want to visualize
your sales analysis"
617.787,2.22,"to show the percentage
of your company's sales"
620.007,2.49,"that come from
online transactions,"
622.497,1.71,you could use a pie chart.
624.207,3.81,"The size of each slice would be
the percentage of total sales"
628.017,1.48,that it represents.
629.497,3.65,"So if your online sales
accounted for 60%,"
633.147,3.33,"the slice would be
60% of the whole pie."
636.477,1.65,"Now, here's a
misleading pie chart."
638.127,3.15,"It's supposed to show
opinions about pizza toppings,"
641.277,3.06,"but each slice or
segment represents"
644.337,1.75,more than one option.
646.087,2.63,"And they all add up
to well over 100%."
648.717,1.71,"There's lots of
ingredients listed"
650.427,2.34,"below the image that
are not even included"
652.767,0.99,in the visual data.
653.757,2.76,"And all of the segments
are the same size"
656.517,3.19,"even though they're supposed
to be showing different values."
659.707,2.36,"If a visualization
looks confusing,"
662.067,2.7,then it probably is confusing.
664.767,1.74,"Let's explore
another example where"
666.507,1.59,"the size of the
graphic components"
668.097,3.21,"comes into play, this
time with a bar chart."
671.307,2.46,"In a truncated bar
chart, like this one,"
673.767,3.66,"the values on the y-axis
don't start at zero."
677.427,5.91,"The data points start at 9,100
and are at intervals of 100."
683.337,2.19,"This makes it seem
like the data,"
685.527,3.06,"let's say, it's for novel clicks
per day on different website"
688.587,3.36,"links, is fairly wide ranging."
691.947,4.41,"In this view, website E
seems to clearly receive way"
696.357,3.15,"more clicks than website D,
which receives more clicks"
699.507,2.36,"than website C, and so on."
701.867,2.31,"While the graph is
clear and the elements"
704.177,3.42,"are easy to understand, the
way the data is presented"
707.597,1.68,is misleading.
709.277,3.57,"Let's try to fix this by
changing the graphs y-axis so"
712.847,2.88,that it starts at zero instead.
715.727,2.94,"Now, the difference between
the website clicks per day"
718.667,3.02,don't look nearly as drastic.
721.687,3.06,"By making the y-axis
start at zero,"
724.747,2.13,"we're changing the
visual proportions"
726.877,3.36,"to be more accurate
and more honest."
730.237,3.63,"Some platforms always
start their y-axis at zero,"
733.867,2.46,"but other programs,
like spreadsheets,"
736.327,2.62,might not fix the y-axis.
738.947,1.61,"So it's important
to keep this in mind"
740.557,1.95,when creating visualizations.
742.507,3.22,"By following the conventions
of data analysis,"
745.727,2.9,"you'll be able to avoid
misleading visualizations."
748.627,1.8,"You always want
your visualizations"
750.427,3.45,"to be clear and easy
to understand but never"
753.877,2.1,"at the expense of
communicating ideas"
755.977,2.05,that are true to the data.
758.027,2.99,"So we've talked about
some effective data-driven"
761.017,3.99,"visualizations, like bar graphs,
line graphs, and pie charts,"
765.007,2.22,and when to use them.
767.227,2.22,"On top of that, we've
discussed some things"
769.447,2.46,"to avoid in your
visualizations to keep them"
771.907,1.71,from being misleading.
773.617,3.15,"Coming up, we'll check out how
to make those visualizations"
776.767,1.8,reach your target audience.
778.567,3.445,See you then.
782.012,2.982,[MUSIC PLAYING]
786.487,1.74,"Earlier, we discussed
the relationship"
788.227,1.95,between data and images.
790.177,3.39,"Now we'll build on that to
explore what visualizations can"
793.567,3.39,"reveal to your audience and
how to make your graphics"
796.957,1.8,as effective as possible.
798.757,2.07,"One of your biggest
considerations"
800.827,1.86,"when creating a
data visualization"
802.687,2.67,"is where you'd like
your audience to focus."
805.357,3.03,"Showing too much can be
distracting and leave"
808.387,1.44,your audience confused.
809.827,3.22,"In some cases, restricting
data can be a good thing."
813.047,2.06,"On the other hand,
showing too little"
815.107,3.15,"can make your visualization
unclear and less meaningful."
818.257,3.21,"As a general rule, as long
as it's not misleading,"
821.467,2.46,"you should visually
represent only the data"
823.927,1.92,"that your audience
needs in order"
825.847,1.94,to understand your findings.
827.787,2.35,"OK, now let's talk
about what you"
830.137,1.92,can show with visualizations.
832.057,2.08,Change over time is a big one.
834.137,2.96,"If your analysis involves
how the data has changed"
837.097,3.93,"over a certain period, could be
days, weeks, months, or years,"
841.027,3.51,"you can set your visualization
to show only the time period"
844.537,2.22,relevant to your objective.
846.757,3.72,"This visualization shows the
search interests and news story"
850.477,4.14,"topics, like environment and
science and social issues."
854.617,3.57,"The viz is set up to show how
the search interest changes day"
858.187,1.05,to day.
859.237,3.87,"The bubbles represent the
most popular topic on each day"
863.107,2.46,in a given part of the US.
865.567,1.89,"As news stories
come up, the data"
867.457,3.42,"changes to reflect the
topic of those stories."
870.877,3.69,"If we wanted the data for
weekly or monthly news cycles,"
874.567,1.59,"we'd change the
interactive feature"
876.157,2.59,"to show changes
by week or month."
878.747,1.62,"Another situation
is when you need"
880.367,2.94,"to show how your
data is distributed."
883.307,2.49,"A histogram resembles
a bar graph,"
885.797,3.66,"but it's a chart that shows
how often data values fall"
889.457,1.95,into certain ranges.
891.407,2.82,"This histogram
shows a lot of data"
894.227,3.69,"and how it's distributed on a
narrow range from negative one"
897.917,1.8,to positive one.
899.717,3.57,"Each bin or bucket,
as the bar is called,"
903.287,1.98,"contains a certain
number of values"
905.267,3.66,"that fall into one
small part of the range."
908.927,2.43,"If you don't need to
show that much data,"
911.357,2.43,"other histograms would
be more effective,"
913.787,3.27,"like this one about the
length of dinosaurs."
917.057,2.49,"Here, the bins or
buckets of data values"
919.547,3.39,"are segmented so you can
show each value that falls"
922.937,2.86,into each part of the range.
925.797,2.73,"If your data needs to
be ranked, like when"
928.527,3.36,"ordering the number of
responses to survey questions,"
931.887,1.77,"you should first
think about what"
933.657,3.15,"you want to highlight
in your visualization."
936.807,2.91,"Bar charts with horizontal
bars effectively"
939.717,4.2,"show data that's ranked with
bars arranged in ascending"
943.917,2.55,or descending order.
946.467,3.63,"A bar chart should always
be ranked by value,"
950.097,3.6,"unless there's a natural order
to the data like age or time,"
953.697,1.35,for example.
955.047,3.9,"This simple bar chart shows
metals, like gold and platinum,"
958.947,1.92,ranked by density.
960.867,2.76,"An audience would be able
to clearly see the ranking"
963.627,2.67,"and quickly determine which
metals had the highest"
966.297,4.23,"density even if this data viz
included a lot more metals."
970.527,3.99,"Correlation charts can show
relationships among data,"
974.517,1.62,"but they should be
used with caution"
976.137,1.77,"because they might
lead viewers to think"
977.907,2.28,that the data shows causation.
980.187,3.21,"Causation, or a cause
effect relationship,"
983.397,3.81,"occurs when an action
directly leads to an outcome."
987.207,2.73,"Correlation and causation
are often mixed up"
989.937,2.82,"because humans like
to find patterns even"
992.757,1.39,when they don't exist.
994.147,3.74,"So if two variables look like
they're associated in some way,"
997.887,3.689,"we might assume that one's
dependent on the other."
1001.576,3.0,"That implies causation
even if the variables"
1004.576,2.22,are completely independent.
1006.796,3.03,"And if we put that data
into a visualization,"
1009.826,1.561,then it would be misleading.
1011.387,3.06,"But correlation charts
that do show causation"
1014.447,1.45,can be effective.
1015.897,3.23,"For example, this
correlation chart"
1019.127,3.48,"has one line of data showing
the average traffic for Google"
1022.607,2.58,searches on Tuesdays in Brazil.
1025.187,3.21,"The other line's for a specific
date of search traffic,"
1028.397,1.89,June 15.
1030.287,2.16,"So the data is
automatically correlated"
1032.447,1.74,"because both lines
are representing"
1034.187,2.88,"the same basic information,
but the chart also"
1037.067,1.53,shows one big difference.
1038.597,3.66,"When a football match or
soccer match for Americans"
1042.257,3.3,"began on June 15,
the search traffic"
1045.557,1.86,showed a significant drop.
1047.417,1.83,This implies causation.
1049.247,3.66,"Football is a very popular and
important sport for Brazilians,"
1052.907,2.82,"and the data in this
chart verifies that."
1055.727,3.6,"We've now talked about time
series charts, histograms,"
1059.327,2.76,"ranked bar charts, and
correlation charts."
1062.087,1.86,"Each of these
charts can visualize"
1063.947,1.86,a different type of analysis.
1065.807,2.88,"Your business
objective and audience"
1068.687,2.97,"will help figure out which of
these common visualizations"
1071.657,0.75,to choose.
1072.407,1.98,"Or you may want to check
out some other kinds"
1074.387,1.6,of visualizations out there.
1075.987,2.18,"There's also a glossary
of visualizations"
1078.167,2.05,"that you'll be able
to reference later."
1080.217,2.9,"So that wraps up our lesson
on creating visualizations."
1083.117,3.24,"Coming up next, we'll add some
more layers to your planning"
1086.357,1.57,and execution of visuals.
1087.927,2.984,So hang on tight.
1090.911,3.402,[MUSIC PLAYING]
1095.777,1.65,"So far, we've shown
that there's lots"
1097.427,2.16,"of choices you'll
make as a data analyst"
1099.587,2.44,when creating visualizations.
1102.027,2.49,"Each of your choices
should help make sure"
1104.517,3.95,"that your visuals are
meaningful and effective."
1108.467,1.61,"Another choice
you'll need to make"
1110.077,2.01,"is whether you want
your visualizations"
1112.087,3.01,to be static or dynamic.
1115.097,3.09,"Static visualizations
do not change over time"
1118.187,2.05,unless they're edited.
1120.237,2.04,"They can be useful when
you want to control"
1122.277,3.16,your data and your data story.
1125.437,4.39,"Any visualization printed on
paper is automatically static."
1129.827,2.1,"Charts and graphs
created in spreadsheets"
1131.927,1.78,are often static too.
1133.707,2.72,"For example, the owner
of this spreadsheet"
1136.427,3.15,"might have to change the data
in order for the visualization"
1139.577,1.26,to update.
1140.837,3.51,"Now, dynamic visualizations
are interactive or change"
1144.347,1.26,over time.
1145.607,2.07,"The interactive nature
of these graphics"
1147.677,3.57,"means that users have some
control over what they see."
1151.247,2.04,"This can be helpful
if stakeholders"
1153.287,1.86,"want to adjust what
they're able to view."
1155.147,2.88,"Let's check out a
visualization about happiness"
1158.027,2.13,that we've created in Tableau.
1160.157,2.73,"Tableau is a business
intelligence and analytics"
1162.887,4.32,"platform that helps people see,
understand, and make decisions"
1167.207,1.05,with data.
1168.257,3.3,"Visualizations in Tableau are
automatically interactive."
1171.557,3.0,"We'll go into the dashboard to
see how the happiness score has"
1174.557,4.71,changed from 2015 to 2017.
1179.267,4.41,"We can check this out in our
12th slide, yearly happiness"
1183.677,1.17,changes.
1184.847,2.58,"On the left, are the
country level changes"
1187.427,1.86,in happiness score.
1189.287,2.67,"The countries are sorted
by largest increase"
1191.957,2.13,to largest decrease.
1194.087,3.78,"On the right, there's a map
with overall happiness scores."
1197.867,3.03,"The color scale moves from
blue for the countries"
1200.897,2.64,"with the highest
happiness score to red"
1203.537,1.44,for those with the lowest.
1204.977,3.27,"If you look below the
map you'll notice a year"
1208.247,3.6,"to view slider where people can
choose which year's happiness"
1211.847,3.21,scores to display on the map.
1215.057,3.57,"It's currently set for
2016, but if someone"
1218.627,3.9,"wants to know the
scores for 2015 or 2017,"
1222.527,2.09,they can adjust the slider.
1224.617,3.57,"They could then make note of
how the color coding and score"
1228.187,3.62,labels change from year to year.
1231.807,4.47,"Other dynamic visualizations
upload new data automatically."
1236.277,2.73,"These bar graphs
continually update data"
1239.007,2.81,by the minute and second.
1241.817,3.94,"Other data visuals can do the
same by day, week, or month."
1245.757,3.5,"So if you need to, you can
show trends in real time."
1249.257,2.04,"Having an interactive
visualization"
1251.297,3.69,"can be useful for both you and
the audience you share it with."
1254.987,3.03,"But it's good to remember
that the more power you give"
1258.017,3.75,"the user, the less control
you have over the story"
1261.767,2.38,you want the data to tell.
1264.147,2.61,"It's something to keep in mind
as you learn how to create"
1266.757,1.8,your own visualizations.
1268.557,3.69,"You want to find the right
balance between interactivity"
1272.247,1.41,and control.
1273.657,1.89,"Something else to
consider is a choice"
1275.547,2.97,"between using a static
or dynamic visualization."
1278.517,2.1,"This will usually
depend on the data"
1280.617,2.82,"you're visualizing, the
audience you're presenting to,"
1283.437,2.95,"and how you're giving
your presentation."
1286.387,1.82,"Now that we've
made some decisions"
1288.207,2.89,"about what kind of data
it is we want to create,"
1291.097,2.54,"we can start thinking
about the design, which"
1293.637,3.06,"is exactly where we're going to
start talking about next time."
1296.697,2.856,See you there.
1299.553,3.318,[MUSIC PLAYING]
1303.892,2.625,"You probably didn't think you'd
be learning about art in a data"
1306.517,2.76,"analytics course, but that's
exactly what we're going to do."
1309.277,2.34,"Both data analysts
and artists use"
1311.617,2.02,elements of art in their work.
1313.637,2.15,"We'll introduce those
elements to you here,"
1315.787,3.85,"and we'll show you how to apply
them to visualizations later."
1319.637,6.33,"The elements we'll check out
our line, shape, color, space,"
1325.967,1.77,and movement.
1327.737,2.65,"Now, these aren't the
only elements to consider,"
1330.387,3.35,"but these particular ones can
add value to your data viz"
1333.737,3.24,"by making them more visually
effective and compelling."
1336.977,3.39,"Lines and visualizations
can be curved or straight,"
1340.367,4.71,"thick or thin, vertical,
horizontal, or diagonal."
1345.077,2.73,"They can add visual
form to your data"
1347.807,3.4,"and help build the structure
for your visualization."
1351.207,2.37,"These charts show
some of the variety"
1353.577,2.46,"that lines can bring
to your data viz."
1356.037,2.28,"The combo chart shows
two different types"
1358.317,3.93,"of lines both providing
a graphic for the data."
1362.247,4.5,"The line chart does the same
but uses curved lines instead."
1366.747,2.13,"Shapes are also known
for their variety."
1368.877,3.36,"Shapes and visualizations should
always be two-dimensional."
1372.237,2.34,"This is because
three-dimensional objects"
1374.577,2.52,"in a visualization can
complicate the visual"
1377.097,2.45,and confuse the audience.
1379.547,1.8,"Shapes are also a
great way to add"
1381.347,3.75,"eye catching contrast,
especially size contrast,"
1385.097,1.38,to your data story.
1386.477,2.52,"This circle, used
for a pie chart,"
1388.997,4.37,"lets someone quickly understand
the data in a familiar format."
1393.367,4.09,"Shapes with symmetry are
usually more familiar to people,"
1397.457,1.64,"so there's less work
for the audience"
1399.097,3.05,"to do when viewing
symmetrical data viz."
1402.147,2.76,"But the asymmetrical
shapes in this map"
1404.907,3.27,"are still instantly
recognizable as countries."
1408.177,2.1,"It's good to note
that the data you're"
1410.277,1.89,"sharing with your
audience will usually"
1412.167,5.15,"inform the types of shapes you
want to use in your database."
1417.317,5.14,"Next, we have colors, and
colors are, well, colors."
1422.457,2.13,"Of course, in the eyes
of artists and analysts,"
1424.587,2.28,colors can be much more complex.
1426.867,4.2,"Colors can be described by
their hue, intensity, and value."
1431.067,3.63,"The hue of a color is basically
its name, red, green, blue,"
1434.697,1.63,and so on.
1436.327,3.9,"Intensity is how bright
or dull a color is."
1440.227,2.49,"And finally, there's value."
1442.717,2.79,"The value is how light
or dark the colors"
1445.507,2.21,are in a visualization.
1447.717,3.57,"In more scientific terms,
value indicates how much"
1451.287,2.07,light is being reflected.
1453.357,2.4,"Dark values, with
some black added,"
1455.757,3.9,"are called shades of color,
like these shades of green."
1459.657,3.3,"Light values, with white
added, are called tints,"
1462.957,2.31,like these tints of blue.
1465.267,3.6,"In this map, there are
shades and tints of gray."
1468.867,2.34,"The value of these
colors help us understand"
1471.207,1.71,the population data in the map.
1472.917,3.63,"And varying the colors value
can be a very effective way"
1476.547,3.63,"to draw our audience's
attention to specific areas."
1480.177,4.44,"Space is the area between,
around, and in the objects."
1484.617,3.15,"There should always be space
in data visualizations,"
1487.767,3.19,just not too much or too little.
1490.957,2.16,"For example, the
space between the bars"
1493.117,3.03,"of a bar graph like this
one should be smaller"
1496.147,2.04,"than the width of
the bars themselves."
1498.187,1.86,"This will draw the
viewer's attention"
1500.047,2.31,"to the bar and the
data it represents"
1502.357,1.47,instead of the empty space.
1503.827,2.72,"Finally, there's movement."
1506.547,3.68,"Movement is used to create
a sense of flow or action"
1510.227,1.74,in a visualization.
1511.967,3.45,"One of my favorite examples
is the data viz, The Wealth"
1515.417,2.11,and Health of Nations.
1517.527,3.81,"This viz showcases a correlation
between the financial health"
1521.337,2.82,and physical health of nations.
1524.157,2.65,"It traces these
elements over time,"
1526.807,4.02,"so you can see how the two
correlated effects play out."
1530.827,2.88,"The movement pulls in
data from the 1800s"
1533.707,2.28,all the way up until recently.
1535.987,3.27,"The interactivity allows
for a greater volume of data"
1539.257,3.39,"to be displayed and will
reveal multiple stories"
1542.647,2.34,"from the same data
visualization."
1544.987,3.69,"Remember, this is something
that should be used sparingly."
1548.677,2.7,"There's a fine line between
attracting attention"
1551.377,2.16,and distracting the audience.
1553.537,2.91,"A static image lets you
control all elements"
1556.447,2.19,of the story you want to tell.
1558.637,2.88,"When you start incorporating
movement and interactivity,"
1561.517,1.83,"the story is
controlled by whoever"
1563.347,2.64,"is controlling the
interactivity, whether that's"
1565.987,2.52,"you or possibly your
audience, if you've"
1568.507,2.67,turned control over to them.
1571.177,3.78,"We'll discuss this delicate
balance later on in the course."
1574.957,2.43,"When you bring many
of these art elements"
1577.387,4.17,"together in a visualization
like this one about sea levels,"
1581.557,2.67,"it can be beautiful
and provoking."
1584.227,3.72,"It proves that there's a place
for creative expression in data"
1587.947,1.62,analytics.
1589.567,2.13,"Coming up, we'll
continue exploring ways"
1591.697,2.79,"to add meaningful creative
expression to your data viz."
1594.487,2.802,Bye for now.
1597.289,2.808,[MUSIC PLAYING]
1602.37,1.417,"Hopefully, by now,
we've developed"
1603.787,2.22,a clear picture of data viz.
1606.007,2.85,"We've explored everything
from design principles"
1608.857,3.84,"to the types of charts you can
use in your visualizations."
1612.697,2.94,"Choosing the right visualization
for your data findings"
1615.637,3.21,"can often come down
to one question, which"
1618.847,2.34,"one will make it
easiest for the user"
1621.187,3.31,"to understand the point
you're trying to make?"
1624.497,3.06,"No matter how complex
your analysis is,"
1627.557,3.57,"your audience will only care
about what's in front of them"
1631.127,2.46,"and how easy they
can understand it."
1633.587,1.98,"As you complete your
analyzes, you'll"
1635.567,3.27,"have to decide which
visualizations serve your needs"
1638.837,3.25,"and your audience's
needs for each task."
1642.087,3.08,"For example, if you want
to show a comparison"
1645.167,3.03,"of the different age groups
of visitors to a website,"
1648.197,3.48,"a line graph with a line
for each age group plus one"
1651.677,2.71,for total users would work.
1654.387,2.9,"Well, say you want to highlight
the differences among the age"
1657.287,2.49,"groups to compare
them more directly."
1659.777,3.18,"For that, you might use
a positive negative bar"
1662.957,2.95,chart like this.
1665.907,3.03,"We've touched on this before,
but let's make some more"
1668.937,1.83,"connections between
the data you'll"
1670.767,3.3,"have after analysis
and the visualizations"
1674.067,3.23,"you'll want to use
for different cases."
1677.297,2.28,We'll start with some charts.
1679.577,1.92,"You've worked with
some of these before"
1681.497,2.97,"and we'll cover more about
charts with more examples"
1684.467,1.15,later.
1685.617,1.79,"You'll also discover
that the best"
1687.407,2.37,"charts to suit
your purposes might"
1689.777,2.85,"depend on the needs of
your industry and company"
1692.627,2.91,"and the stakeholders who
will be in your audience."
1695.537,2.01,"For comparing data over
time, we showed you"
1697.547,3.21,"how line graphs can be
effective, like in this one."
1700.757,3.75,"Bar graphs and stacked bar
graphs, along with area charts,"
1704.507,2.04,"can also be good
ways to visualize"
1706.547,2.01,how data changes over time.
1708.557,2.95,"By the way, there's a
lot of charts out there."
1711.507,1.7,"We'll give you as
much information"
1713.207,2.5,"as possible about
as many as we can."
1715.707,2.39,"But doing your own
research or practicing"
1718.097,4.65,"using them in visualizations
will also be helpful."
1722.747,2.46,"When you're comparing
distinct objects,"
1725.207,4.17,"like in our example about
mobile versus computer usage,"
1729.377,2.58,"ordered bar and
grouped bar graphs"
1731.957,3.27,"and ordered column
charts are useful."
1735.227,3.12,"Then, there's charts that
show parts of a whole."
1738.347,2.13,"This is known as
data composition,"
1740.477,2.7,"and it's achieved by
combining the individual parts"
1743.177,3.09,"of a visualization and
displaying them together"
1746.267,1.02,as a whole.
1747.287,4.41,"Stacked bars, donuts,
stacked areas, pie charts,"
1751.697,2.97,and tree maps can do all this.
1754.667,2.01,"Now, to show relationships
in your data,"
1756.677,2.37,"you might want to use
scatterplot and bubble"
1759.047,3.54,"charts, column line
charts, and heat maps."
1762.587,1.95,"Let's revisit the
happiness data viz"
1764.537,2.37,to show you an example of this.
1766.907,2.82,"Each of these scatter
plots show the relationship"
1769.727,3.33,"between a country's happiness
score and one of the factors"
1773.057,2.69,that contributes to that score.
1775.747,2.33,"So the health versus
happiness scatterplot"
1778.077,3.09,"shows a strong relationship
between the life expectancy"
1781.167,3.96,"of people living in a country
and how happy those people are."
1785.127,3.16,"Basically, as life
expectancy increases,"
1788.287,2.36,so does their happiness score.
1790.647,2.94,"Speaking of happiness, a
successful data visualization"
1793.587,1.83,results in a happy audience.
1795.417,3.3,"So it's important to understand
how your audience is viewing"
1798.717,3.12,"your data visualizations
since they should always"
1801.837,1.65,be top of mind.
1803.487,1.86,And it all starts in the brain.
1805.347,2.13,"When processing
information, our brains"
1807.477,3.42,"try to find patterns and
rely on visual context."
1810.897,3.18,"As data analysts, we can
use our understanding"
1814.077,4.41,"of the human visual system
to produce better visuals."
1818.487,2.1,"When we create
visualizations, we"
1820.587,3.93,"can do so in a way that
helps the audience process"
1824.517,4.14,"the information and helps them
remember what they're seeing."
1828.657,2.19,"Visual journalist
Dona Wong proposes"
1830.847,2.01,"that effective visuals,
like the data viz"
1832.857,3.91,"we've been discussing here,
have three essential elements."
1836.767,2.81,The first is clear meaning.
1839.577,3.12,"Good visualizations clearly
communicate their intended"
1842.697,1.26,insight.
1843.957,1.89,"The second is a
sophisticated use"
1845.847,2.88,"of contrast, which helps
separate the most important"
1848.727,3.0,"data from the rest using
visual contexts that our brains"
1851.727,2.06,naturally look for.
1853.787,3.0,"The third essential element
for effective visuals"
1856.787,2.22,is refined execution.
1859.007,3.12,"Visuals with refined execution
include deep attention"
1862.127,3.72,"to detail using visual elements,
like lines, shapes, colors,"
1865.847,3.52,"value, space, and
movement, in other words,"
1869.367,2.88,"the elements of art that
we talked about earlier."
1872.247,1.61,"The first rule in
most businesses"
1873.857,1.53,is to satisfy the customer.
1875.387,2.49,"It's no different
with data analytics."
1877.877,1.98,"While your customers
will probably"
1879.857,2.07,"be managers and
other stakeholders,"
1881.927,3.06,"you should always think of
them first when creating data"
1884.987,1.41,visualizations.
1886.397,3.12,"Think about the five second
rule we called out earlier."
1889.517,3.27,"If you make your data viz
easy to look at and understand"
1892.787,2.76,"quickly, then you'll
have done your job."
1895.547,2.97,"And then you'll be satisfied,
just like your customers."
1898.517,2.43,"Coming up, we'll talk about
design thinking and data"
1900.947,0.99,visualizations.
1901.937,2.816,See you soon.
1904.753,3.353,[MUSIC PLAYING]
1909.547,2.1,"We've covered a lot of
ground in our exploration"
1911.647,1.2,of data visualizations.
1912.847,2.19,"We've talked a lot about
how your audience should"
1915.037,3.9,"be the focus when you are making
decisions about charts, colors,"
1918.937,4.62,"space, labels, and everything
else that goes into a data viz."
1923.557,2.94,"Now, let's talk about
design thinking."
1926.497,3.83,"Design thinking is a process
used to solve complex problems"
1930.327,2.48,in a user-centric way.
1932.807,2.61,"When you bring design
thinking into your work,"
1935.417,2.85,"you're trying to identify
alternative strategies"
1938.267,3.36,"for your visualizations that
might not be clear right away."
1941.627,1.95,"You have to challenge
your own thinking"
1943.577,2.79,"and explore different ways
of approaching the problems"
1946.367,2.28,and finding solutions.
1948.647,2.73,"Airbnb is one
example of a company"
1951.377,2.46,"that use a design
thinking approach to help"
1953.837,1.53,their business grow.
1955.367,3.3,"When the company, a vacation
rental online marketplace,"
1958.667,2.76,"wasn't generating as much
revenue as they wanted,"
1961.427,2.7,"they decided to
start experimenting."
1964.127,2.61,"Even though the data they
collected and analyzed"
1966.737,3.21,"was valuable, they needed
to look at their product"
1969.947,2.16,"through the eyes
of the customer."
1972.107,3.09,"They realized the photos of
the places that customers were"
1975.197,2.17,seeing just weren't very good.
1977.367,2.66,"So they decided to help
their customers replace"
1980.027,4.2,"the not-so-great photos with
more professional looking ones."
1984.227,3.81,"So they hired a photographer
and went door to door"
1988.037,3.42,"to take professional photos of
their New York City listings."
1991.457,2.52,"In a week, the listings
with these photos"
1993.977,1.89,"saw two to three
times more bookings,"
1995.867,3.54,"and their revenue nearly doubled
thanks to their new design"
1999.407,2.28,thinking user-based mindset.
2001.687,2.79,"If design thinking can work
for companies like Airbnb,"
2004.477,1.86,it can help data analysts too.
2006.337,3.6,"And data visualization is the
perfect stage of your analysis"
2009.937,2.84,to apply a user-based mindset.
2012.777,3.81,"If you use design thinking when
planning and creating your data"
2016.587,2.73,"viz, you'll be making
decisions based"
2019.317,2.73,"on the needs of the people
who will be viewing them."
2022.047,3.51,"This way your audience will be
engaged and enlightened by how"
2025.557,1.559,you visualize your findings.
2027.116,1.591,"While the design
thinking process"
2028.707,1.679,"comes in lots of
different forms,"
2030.386,2.73,they all have stages or phases.
2033.116,2.641,"We'll talk about five
phases that you can use when"
2035.757,2.28,creating data visualizations.
2038.037,6.32,"Empathize, define, ideate,
prototype, and test."
2044.357,1.98,"In the spirit of
design thinking,"
2046.337,3.0,"these phases don't have
to follow a set order."
2049.337,3.629,"Instead, think of them
as an overview of actions"
2052.966,3.0,"that can help you produce
a user centered design"
2055.966,1.531,in your visualizations.
2057.497,2.55,"In the empathize
phase, you think"
2060.047,2.879,"about the emotions and
needs of the target audience"
2062.926,3.511,"of your data viz, whether it's
stakeholders, team members,"
2066.437,1.469,or the general public.
2067.906,1.681,"Here you should
avoid areas where"
2069.587,2.28,"people might face
obstacles interacting"
2071.867,1.74,with your visualizations.
2073.607,2.28,"For example, let's say
you've been working"
2075.887,2.25,"on an analysis for a
pharmaceutical company"
2078.137,3.87,"about how patients have been
responding to a new treatment."
2082.007,2.38,"You're getting ready
to visualize the data,"
2084.387,2.51,"so you should think
about the audience, which"
2086.897,3.18,"will include stakeholders,
like pharmacists, doctors,"
2090.077,2.21,and other medical professionals.
2092.287,2.5,"Maybe you're thinking of using
a color scheme that you like,"
2094.787,1.98,"but you realize that
these colors might"
2096.767,2.25,be a challenge to some people.
2099.017,2.13,"The colors might be
too bright or dramatic,"
2101.147,3.66,"which might not be right for
the seriousness of the data."
2104.807,3.0,"Or the colors might not have
enough contrast for people who"
2107.807,2.66,have color vision deficiencies.
2110.467,2.46,"By adjusting the
colors, you'll be"
2112.927,3.43,"empathizing with the
needs of your audience."
2116.357,3.48,"If there's someone on your
team who is vision impaired,"
2119.837,2.79,"you'll want to find a way
to explain the data verbally"
2122.627,0.91,as well.
2123.537,1.67,"The define phase
helps you define"
2125.207,3.36,"your audience's needs, their
problems, and your insights."
2128.567,2.7,"This goes hand in hand
with the empathize phase"
2131.267,2.43,"as you'll use what you
learned in that phase"
2133.697,2.97,"to help you spell out exactly
what your audience needs"
2136.667,2.13,from your visualization.
2138.797,2.28,"You could use this phase
to think about which data"
2141.077,1.86,to show in your visualization.
2142.937,2.28,"Maybe this data viz
will also be presented"
2145.217,3.27,"to patients who are part
of your company's study."
2148.487,2.55,"While you'll need to
meet your objectives,"
2151.037,1.86,"there might be data
that could make"
2152.897,2.85,these people uncomfortable.
2155.747,2.48,"You can think of ways
to position that data"
2158.227,1.98,to make it more digestible.
2160.207,2.58,"Or if you're presenting
to different audiences,"
2162.787,1.62,"you can adjust
your visualizations"
2164.407,2.4,"to meet each group's
needs by seeking input"
2166.807,2.7,"from members of the group
or colleagues who've"
2169.507,2.37,worked with that group before.
2171.877,3.42,"In the ideate phase, you start
to generate your data viz"
2175.297,1.44,ideas.
2176.737,2.58,"You'll use all of your
findings from the empathize"
2179.317,5.25,"and define phases to brainstorm
potential data viz solutions."
2184.567,2.48,"This might involve creating
drafts of your visualization"
2187.047,2.1,"with different
color combinations"
2189.147,3.03,"or maybe experimenting
with different shapes."
2192.177,2.55,"Creating as many
examples as possible"
2194.727,2.73,will help you refine your ideas.
2197.457,2.7,"The key here is to always
remember your audience"
2200.157,2.79,"when coming up with
ideas and strategies."
2202.947,2.04,"You want to think about
how you can position"
2204.987,3.27,"your visualizations to meet
the needs and expectations"
2208.257,1.26,of your audience.
2209.517,2.67,"The final two phases
are prototype and test."
2212.187,2.79,"Here, you'll start putting
your charts, dashboards,"
2214.977,2.89,"or other visualizations
together."
2217.867,1.62,"If you've kept your
audience in mind"
2219.487,1.56,"through all the
phases to this point,"
2221.047,4.13,"then your data viz will be
informative and approachable."
2225.177,2.7,"You might want to create
lots of visualizations"
2227.877,3.38,"to choose which one best
meets your objective."
2231.257,2.16,"You can test your
visualizations by showing"
2233.417,1.92,"them to team members
before presenting them"
2235.337,1.59,to stakeholders.
2236.927,3.06,"If you've created more
than one for the same data"
2239.987,2.82,"or for different audiences,
like the medical professionals"
2242.807,2.71,"and the patients from
our earlier example,"
2245.517,2.69,"you can share all
of your options."
2248.207,3.15,"As always, listen to
any feedback you get."
2251.357,2.49,"Critiques, both
your own and others,"
2253.847,3.33,"are key to the design
thinking process."
2257.177,2.04,"They help you keep your
focus on the audience"
2259.217,3.48,"by integrating new ideas
in your final product."
2262.697,3.13,"The phrase thinking outside
the box is used a lot,"
2265.827,2.28,but it definitely applies here.
2268.107,4.25,"The box, in this case, is your
own usual way of approaching"
2272.357,2.28,data and it's visualization.
2274.637,2.61,"If you embrace design
thinking, you'll"
2277.247,2.22,"be able to create
super effective data"
2279.467,2.6,viz for any audience.
2282.067,2.25,"Up next, we'll cover
more things you"
2284.317,2.76,"need to consider
within your data viz."
2287.077,3.17,See you there.
2290.247,2.868,[MUSIC PLAYING]
2295.027,2.09,"So we've learned data
visualizations are designed"
2297.117,2.7,"to help an audience
process information quickly"
2299.817,1.54,and memorably.
2301.357,2.76,"You might remember the 5-second
rule we covered earlier."
2304.117,3.48,"Within the first 5 seconds of
seeing a data visualization,"
2307.597,2.16,"your audience should
understand exactly what"
2309.757,1.14,you're trying to convey.
2310.897,2.85,"Five seconds might
seem like a flash,"
2313.747,1.98,"but adding in
descriptive wording"
2315.727,3.0,"can really help your audience
interpret and understand"
2318.727,1.62,the data in the right way.
2320.347,2.52,"Your audience will be less
likely to have questions"
2322.867,4.02,"about what you're sharing if
you add headlines, subtitles,"
2326.887,1.98,and labels.
2328.867,3.03,"One of the easiest ways to
highlight key data in your data"
2331.897,1.95,viz is through headlines.
2333.847,3.48,"A headline is a line of words
printed in large letters"
2337.327,2.4,"at the top of the
visualization to communicate"
2339.727,2.29,what data is being presented.
2342.017,2.6,"It's the attention grabber
that makes your audience want"
2344.617,1.41,to read more.
2346.027,2.65,"Take charts, for example."
2348.677,3.81,"A chart without a headline is
like a report without a title."
2352.487,2.18,"You want to make it
easy to understand"
2354.667,2.17,what your chart's about.
2356.837,3.15,"Be sure to use clear,
concise language,"
2359.987,3.57,"explaining all information
as plainly as possible."
2363.557,3.36,"Try to avoid using
abbreviations or acronyms"
2366.917,3.27,"even if you think
they're common knowledge."
2370.187,4.53,"The typography and placement of
the headline is important too."
2374.717,2.07,It's best to keep it simple.
2376.787,2.52,"Make it bold or a
few sizes larger"
2379.307,2.37,"than the rest of the text,
and place it directly"
2381.677,3.33,"above the chart
aligned to the left."
2385.007,4.56,"Then, explain your data viz
even further with a subtitle."
2389.567,2.64,"A subtitle supports
the headline by adding"
2392.207,1.92,more context and description.
2394.127,2.76,"Use a font style that matches
the rest of the chart's"
2396.887,2.91,"elements, and place
the subtitle directly"
2399.797,1.59,underneath the headline.
2401.387,2.17,"Now, let's talk about labels."
2403.557,3.06,"Earlier, we mentioned Dona
Wong, a visual journalist"
2406.617,2.52,"who's well known for
sharing guidelines on making"
2409.137,2.11,data viz more effective.
2411.247,3.53,"She makes a very strong case
for using labels directly"
2414.777,3.63,"on the data instead
of relying on legends."
2418.407,1.8,"This is because
lots of charts use"
2420.207,2.91,"different visual properties,
like colors or shapes,"
2423.117,2.58,"to represent different
values of data."
2425.697,4.35,"A legend or key identifies the
meaning of various elements"
2430.047,1.86,"in a data visualization
and can be"
2431.907,3.78,"used as an alternative to
labeling data directly."
2435.687,2.91,"Direct labeling like this
keeps your audience's attention"
2438.597,3.81,"fixed on your graphic and helps
them identify data quickly,"
2442.407,2.07,"while legends
forced the audience"
2444.477,3.18,"to do more work because the
legend is positioned away"
2447.657,1.56,from the chart's data.
2449.217,2.4,"The truth is, the more
support we provide"
2451.617,1.74,"our audience, the
less work they have"
2453.357,3.12,"to do trying to understand
what the data is trying to say"
2456.477,3.54,"and the faster our story
will make an impact."
2460.017,2.16,"Now that we've covered
how to make a database as"
2462.177,2.49,"effective as possible,
next up, we'll"
2464.667,2.58,"figure out how to make
it accessible to all."
2467.247,3.34,See you in a bit.
2470.587,3.374,[MUSIC PLAYING]
2475.407,3.33,"Over one billion people in
the world have a disability."
2478.737,3.85,"That's more than the populations
of the United States, Canada,"
2482.587,4.46,"France, Italy, Japan,
Mexico, and Brazil combined."
2487.047,1.98,"Before you design
a data viz, it's"
2489.027,2.43,"important to keep
that fact in mind."
2491.457,2.43,"Not everyone has
the same abilities,"
2493.887,3.66,"and people take in information
in lots of different ways."
2497.547,2.76,"You might have a viewer
who's deaf or hard of hearing"
2500.307,1.89,and relies on captions.
2502.197,1.95,"Or someone who's
colorblind might"
2504.147,2.79,"look to specific labeling
for more description."
2506.937,2.82,"We've covered a lot of ways
to make a data visualization"
2509.757,2.49,"beautiful and
informative, and now, it's"
2512.247,1.77,"time to take that
knowledge and make"
2514.017,1.98,"it accessible to
everyone, including"
2515.997,2.25,those with disabilities.
2518.247,3.18,"Accessibility can be defined
a number of different ways."
2521.427,2.13,"Right from the start,
there's a few ways"
2523.557,1.68,"you can incorporate
accessibility"
2525.237,1.92,in your data visualization.
2527.157,2.59,"You just have to think
a little differently."
2529.747,3.56,"It helps to label data directly
instead of relying exclusively"
2533.307,3.84,"on legends, which require color
interpretation and more effort"
2537.147,1.74,by the viewer to understand.
2538.887,3.24,"This can also just make
it a faster read for those"
2542.127,2.55,with or without disabilities.
2544.677,1.47,Check out this data viz.
2546.147,2.07,"The colors make it
challenging to read,"
2548.217,2.37,and the legend is confusing.
2550.587,3.27,"Now, if we just remove the
legend and add in data labels,"
2553.857,0.88,bam!
2554.737,2.65,"You've got a clearer
presentation."
2557.387,2.81,"Another way to make your
visualizations more accessible"
2560.197,2.49,"is to provide text
alternatives so that it"
2562.687,2.8,"can be changed into
other forms people need,"
2565.487,3.5,"such as large print,
Braille, or speech."
2568.987,2.76,"Alternative text provides
a textual alternative"
2571.747,1.78,to nontext content.
2573.527,2.18,"It allows the
content and function"
2575.707,2.04,"of the image to be
accessible to those"
2577.747,3.27,"with visual or certain
cognitive disabilities."
2581.017,2.85,"Here's an example that shows
additional text describing"
2583.867,1.02,the chart.
2584.887,1.86,"And speaking of
text, you can make"
2586.747,2.67,"data from charts and
diagrams available"
2589.417,4.23,"in a text-based format through
an export to sheets or Excel."
2593.647,3.27,"You can also make it easier for
people to see and hear content"
2596.917,2.67,"by separating foreground
from background."
2599.587,3.33,"Using bright colors that
contrast against the background"
2602.917,1.98,"can help those with
poor visibility,"
2604.897,3.24,"whether permanently or
temporarily, clearly"
2608.137,1.95,see the information conveyed.
2610.087,2.67,"Another option is to
avoid relying solely"
2612.757,3.12,"on color to convey
information and instead"
2615.877,3.66,"distinguish with different
textures and shapes."
2619.537,3.3,"Another general rule is
to avoid over complicating"
2622.837,1.83,data visualizations.
2624.667,2.37,"Overly complicated
data visualizations"
2627.037,4.05,"turn off most audiences because
they can't figure out where"
2631.087,2.24,and what to focus on.
2633.327,3.54,"That's why breaking down data
into simple visualizations"
2636.867,1.2,is key.
2638.067,2.82,"A common mistake is including
too much information"
2640.887,3.72,"in a single piece or
including long chunks of text"
2644.607,2.74,"or too much information
in graphs and charts."
2647.347,3.14,"This can defeat the whole
purpose of your visualization"
2650.487,3.51,"making it impossible to
understand at first glance."
2653.997,3.69,"Ultimately, designing with
an accessibility mindset"
2657.687,2.76,"means thinking about your
audience ahead of time,"
2660.447,3.51,"focusing on simple, easy
to understand visuals,"
2663.957,3.69,"and most importantly,
creating alternative ways"
2667.647,3.27,"for your audience to access
and interact with your data."
2670.917,2.49,"And when you pay attention
to these details,"
2673.407,3.33,"we can find solutions that
make data visualizations more"
2676.737,2.14,effective for everyone.
2678.877,1.7,"So now you completed
your first close"
2680.577,1.98,"up exploration of
data visualization."
2682.557,2.19,"You've discovered the
importance of creating"
2684.747,2.31,"data viz that cater
to your audience"
2687.057,3.02,"while keeping focus
on the objective."
2690.077,2.94,"You learned different ways
to brainstorm and plan"
2693.017,3.15,"your visualizations and how
to choose the best charts"
2696.167,1.53,to meet that objective.
2697.697,2.43,"And you also learned how
to incorporate elements"
2700.127,3.21,"of science, art,
and even philosophy"
2703.337,2.16,into your visualizations.
2705.497,3.18,"Coming up, we'll check out how
to take all of these learnings"
2708.677,1.56,and apply them in Tableau.
2710.237,2.67,"You'll get to see how
this data visualization"
2712.907,4.92,"tool makes your data viz work
more efficient and effective."
