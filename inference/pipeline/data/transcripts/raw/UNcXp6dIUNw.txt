1.99,3.93,"An emerging technology in
computing is quantum computing."
5.92,2.88,"This is computing based
on quantum physics"
8.8,3.03,"rather than being based
on classical physics that"
11.83,1.92,uses 1s and 0s.
13.75,3.78,"This is not an upgrade to your
existing computing system,"
17.53,3.81,"but a type of computing that's
used alongside of our existing"
21.34,0.96,computers.
22.3,4.08,"This is an entirely new way
of performing calculations."
26.38,1.68,"With our traditional
computers, we"
28.06,3.27,"use classical mechanics,
which uses bits."
31.33,2.88,"Those bits are 0s
and 1s, and we can"
34.21,2.76,"apply algorithms
towards those 1s and 0s"
36.97,3.51,"to come up with a solution
to a particular problem."
40.48,3.09,"With quantum computing,
we no longer have bits."
43.57,3.75,"We have something called
quantum bits, or qubits."
47.32,3.78,"These bits are not 1s,
and they're not 0s,"
51.1,1.98,"but instead, they
exist somewhere"
53.08,2.85,in the middle between 1 and 0.
55.93,5.16,"They are effectively a 0
and a 1 at the same time,"
61.09,3.179,"and therein lies some of
the complexities surrounding"
64.269,1.801,quantum mechanics.
66.07,3.39,"Let's compare classical
computing to quantum computing."
69.46,1.89,"In our classical
computing, we might"
71.35,2.73,"want to perform a binary
calculation with four"
74.08,3.9,"separate bits, and we can take
any combination of those four"
77.98,2.31,bits to come up with a value.
80.29,3.51,"For example, we can combine all
of the different permutations"
83.8,2.16,"of those four bits,
and we can look"
85.96,2.49,"at every combination
of those four bits"
88.45,3.93,"to come up with 16
separate unique values."
92.38,3.3,"With quantum computing,
we can represent all 16"
95.68,5.04,"of those individual classic
bits as four individual qubits"
100.72,5.53,"because all of those are
both 0 and 1 simultaneously."
106.25,2.69,"So if it only takes
four individual qubits"
108.94,2.85,"to represent 16
values, we can start"
111.79,2.53,to scale this up very quickly.
114.32,2.54,"For example, if we had
eight different qubits,"
116.86,3.57,that would represent 256 values.
120.43,6.82,"If we had 16 qubits, that
represents 65,536 values."
127.25,3.11,"And if we look at
32 qubits, we now"
130.36,5.16,"have over 4 billion values that
are represented by a relatively"
135.52,2.25,small number of qubits.
137.77,1.98,"It's the scalability
that provides"
139.75,2.79,"some of the biggest potential
advantages for quantum"
142.54,0.87,computing.
143.41,1.68,"This could, for
example, allow us"
145.09,2.76,"to search through
enormous amounts of data"
147.85,2.29,in a very short period of time.
150.14,1.88,"This would change
medical technology,"
152.02,2.07,"it might allow us to
change the way we're"
154.09,1.86,"able to predict
the weather, this"
155.95,4.23,"could have an impact in
astrophysics, and so much more."
160.18,1.89,"One place that
quantum computing has"
162.07,3.33,"a direct effect on
technology with this scaling"
165.4,1.47,is cryptography.
166.87,2.58,"Today, we use very
large prime numbers"
169.45,3.12,"to be able to create the
complexity required to keep"
172.57,1.84,all of our data encrypted.
174.41,2.66,"But what if you had a
quantum computer that"
177.07,3.84,"was able to perform these very
large calculations in a very"
180.91,1.66,short period of time?
182.57,1.58,"This would
effectively render all"
184.15,2.19,"of our existing
cryptography useless"
186.34,3.72,"because our quantum computers
would be able to brute force"
190.06,3.4,"all of our encrypted
data very, very quickly."
193.46,2.84,"A description of how this could
be done with quantum computing"
196.3,1.41,was created by Peter Shor.
197.71,4.23,"He created what's called
Shor's algorithm in 1994,"
201.94,3.24,"where he looked at how we
were using prime numbers"
205.18,2.7,"and came up with a way
that you could greatly"
207.88,2.31,"shorten the process of
being able to factor"
210.19,1.27,this information.
211.46,2.39,"This could take processes
that would effectively"
213.85,2.88,"take longer than the
lifetime of the universe"
216.73,2.43,"and make them
something very feasible"
219.16,2.52,to use with quantum computing.
221.68,3.03,"Fortunately, researchers are
already looking at new ways"
224.71,4.33,"to provide cryptography in this
new world of quantum computing."
229.04,2.76,"One of the ways to
do this is with NTRU."
231.8,2.99,"This is a new way of
performing encryption"
234.79,3.51,"with quantum computing that
instead of using very large"
238.3,4.0,"prime numbers uses a
closest vector problem."
242.3,3.62,"This is a problem that is still
difficult for quantum computing"
245.92,2.76,"to calculate and would
be a very viable way"
248.68,1.53,to provide encryption.
250.21,1.71,"Researchers are also
putting together"
251.92,3.42,"other ideas that will help
us maintain the privacy"
255.34,2.7,"and encryption
technologies we need, even"
258.04,3.33,"in this newer generation
of quantum computing."
261.37,2.76,"One interesting characteristic
of quantum computing"
264.13,2.97,"is that if you examine
the quantum bits,"
267.1,3.54,"you will effectively be
changing those quantum bits."
270.64,2.7,"This means that we can send
information over a quantum"
273.34,2.34,"network, and on the
other side, we're"
275.68,3.87,"able to tell if anyone was
monitoring that conversation."
279.55,1.92,"This is especially
useful if you want"
281.47,1.83,to distribute encryption keys.
283.3,4.86,"You might want to use Quantum
Key Distribution, or QKD."
288.16,3.09,"This allows us to send
our encryption keys"
291.25,2.67,"across the network
to the other side"
293.92,1.8,"without the worry
of someone being"
295.72,3.19,"able to intercept that key
somewhere in the middle."
298.91,2.39,"We would send that
random string of qubits,"
301.3,2.46,"which was effectively
our encryption key,"
303.76,2.29,"across that quantum
network channel."
306.05,3.68,"Once the key is received, both
sides can verify that key,"
309.73,2.25,"and if it's
identical, then no one"
311.98,3.19,"viewed that key during
the transmission process."
315.17,3.38,"However, if someone was to
monitor that conversation,"
318.55,1.92,"it would change
the keys that were"
320.47,2.91,"received on the other
side, and those two keys"
323.38,1.41,would not verify.
324.79,3.06,"This greatly changes the
processes and procedures"
327.85,2.01,"we use for encryption,
and we'll want"
329.86,2.43,"to keep a close eye
on quantum computing"
332.29,2.66,as this technology matures.
