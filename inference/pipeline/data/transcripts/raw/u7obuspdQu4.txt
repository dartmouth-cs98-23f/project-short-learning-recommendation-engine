0.359,3.211,"Welcome to whiteboard programming where we
simplify programming with easy to understand"
3.57,4.4,"whiteboard videos and today I'll be sharing
with the difference between types of neural"
7.97,7.61,"networks, to be specific, the difference between
ann cnn and rnn... so let's get started!"
15.58,1.22,1.
16.8,4.57,"Artificial Neural Network (or ANN) Well, it
is a group where we have multiple perceptrons"
21.37,6.54,"or neurons at each layer and is also known
as a Feed-Forward Neural network because inputs"
27.91,3.22,are processed only in the forward direction.
31.13,4.5,"This type of neural networks are one of the
simplest variants of neural networks as They"
35.63,5.24,"pass information in one direction, through
various input nodes, until it makes it to"
40.87,1.54,the output node.
42.41,5.12,"This type of neural network may or may not
have hidden node layers, making their functioning"
47.53,2.98,more interpretable.
50.51,3.67,"Some of the advantages of Artificial Neural
Network (or ANN) include"
54.18,1.24,1.
55.42,3.66,"they store information on the entire network
2."
59.08,2.8,"they have the ability to work with incomplete
knowledge"
61.88,1.05,3.
62.93,2.82,"they offer fault tolerance and have distributed
memory"
65.75,1.21,4.
66.96,3.14,"they offer us the ability to work with incomplete
knowledge"
70.1,3.73,"Likewise, the disadvantages include,
1."
73.83,2.63,"they have huge hardware dependency
2."
76.46,4.44,"they sometimes have unexplained behavior which
can leave us tormeneted with results"
80.9,1.54,3.
82.44,4.02,"there is no specific rule for determining
the structure of artificial neural networks"
86.46,5.699,"and appropriate network structure is achieved
through experience and trial and error"
92.159,1.261,"Next one on the list, 2."
93.42,5.65,"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Now, they
are one of the most popular models used today."
99.07,4.88,"This type of neural network computational
model uses a variation of multilayer perceptrons"
103.95,6.38,"and contains one or more convolutional layers
that can be either entirely connected or pooled."
110.33,5.899,"Further, these convolutional layers create
feature maps that record a region of the image"
116.229,5.621,"which is ultimately broken into rectangles
and sent out for nonlinear processing."
121.85,3.851,"Some of the advantages of convolutional Neural
Network (or CNN) include"
125.701,1.049,1.
126.75,3.14,"They offer very high accuracy in image recognition
problems"
129.89,1.0,2.
130.89,5.12,"They are capable of automatically detecting
important features without any human supervision"
136.01,1.0,3.
137.01,4.19,"Weight sharing
Likewise, the disadvantages include:"
141.2,1.0,1.
142.2,3.81,"CNNs do not encode the position and orientation
of object"
146.01,1.32,2.
147.33,3.87,"They lack the ability to be spatially invariant
to the input data"
151.2,1.0,3.
152.2,5.47,"A lot of training data is required in order
for it to work efficiently"
157.67,1.95,"Next one on the list, 3."
159.62,5.32,"Recurrent Neural Network (or RNNs) Now, these
are a lot more complex than the ones we discussed"
164.94,1.0,so far.
165.94,5.07,"They save the output of processing nodes and
feed the result back into the model (and hence"
171.01,4.39,"they did not pass the information in one direction
only)."
175.4,4.26,"This is how the model is said to learn to
predict the outcome of a layer."
179.66,5.29,"Here, each node in the RNN model acts as a
memory cell, continuing the computation and"
184.95,6.75,"implementation of operations and if the networkâ€™s
prediction is incorrect, then the system self-learns"
191.7,4.88,"and continues working towards the correct
prediction during backpropagation."
196.58,3.85,"Some of the advantages of Recurrent Neural
Network (or RNNs) include"
200.43,1.0,1.
201.43,3.82,"An RNN remembers each and every information
through time."
205.25,4.959,"It is useful in time series prediction only
because of the feature to remember previous"
210.209,4.041,"inputs as well, this is called Long Short
Term Memory"
214.25,1.12,2.
215.37,5.21,"A Recurrent neural network are even used with
convolutional layers to extend the effective"
220.58,4.48,"pixel neighborhood
Likewise, some disadvantages include:"
225.06,1.0,1.
226.06,2.039,"They have gradient vanishing and exploding
problems"
228.099,1.691,2.
229.79,2.68,"Training an RNN is a very difficult task
3."
232.47,5.89,"It cannot process very long sequences if using
tanh or relu as an activation function"
238.36,6.189,"Next, let's summarize the difference between
ann cnn and rnn in a tabular format,"
244.549,1.031,1.
245.58,6.2,"ANNs operate on tabular or text data, whereas
CNNs operate on image data and RNNs operate"
251.78,2.19,on sequence data 2.
253.97,6.069,"Parameter sharing is not possible in ANNs,
whereas it is possible in CNNs and RNNs 3."
260.039,9.171,"ANNs and CNNs operate on fixed length input,
whereas RNNs don't 4."
269.21,5.909,"recurrent connections are not possible in
ANNs and CNNs whereas in RNNs, they can be"
275.119,2.991,achieved 5.
278.11,6.399,"Spatial relationships are only possible in
CNNs, and not in ANNs and RNNs 6."
284.509,6.86,"ANN is considered to be less powerful than
CNN, RNN whereas CNN is considered to be more"
291.369,6.341,"powerful than ANN, RNN and in terms of performance,
RNN includes less feature compatibility when"
297.71,3.299,compared to CNN 7.
301.009,4.91,"The main advantages of ANNs include Having
fault tolerance, and the ability to work with"
305.919,5.571,"incomplete knowledge whereas in CNNs, there
is High accuracy in image recognition problems,"
311.49,6.199,"and it offers Weight sharing further, an RNN
remembers each and every information and offers"
317.689,5.65,"Time series prediction With that, I hope this
