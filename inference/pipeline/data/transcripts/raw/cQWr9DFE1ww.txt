0.669,4.901,"We’re going to go through the 7 most important
data structures today and explain them as"
5.57,2.05,simply as possible.
7.62,3.86,"These are extremely important to learn whether
its for coding interviews, computer science"
11.48,1.84,"class, or building projects."
13.32,4.37,"We’ll be going through the list from easiest
to hardest, so beginners have a better idea"
17.69,1.39,of where to begin.
19.08,4.39,"We’ll go over a simplified explanation for
what each data structure is and talk about"
23.47,2.19,common uses for that data structure.
25.66,4.59,"I’ll also be putting the time complexity
for common operations on screen, but if you"
30.25,3.449,"don’t know what that is, don’t worry;
I’m just including it on the screen for"
33.699,1.471,people who want to see.
35.17,5.599,"Let’s not waste any time and get right into
it."
40.769,5.28,"Arrays
Arrays are ordered collections of data."
46.049,5.27,"Typically the data is all of a similar type,
like integers or strings, but some languages"
51.319,2.11,also allow for differing data types.
53.429,4.22,"An example of a real-life use for an array
would be if you had temperatures for the next"
57.649,4.631,"5 days, and wanted to store them so your program
could access them."
62.28,3.6,"Arrays are used all the time and for pretty
much everything, so they’re definitely the"
65.88,2.79,most important data structure to learn first.
68.67,4.84,"One of the amazing benefits of using an array
is that it’s very easy to find any element,"
73.51,4.56,"as each element in an array is assigned a
number called an index that you can use to"
78.07,1.67,find it.
79.74,5.689,"This form of numbering is often called “zero-based
indexing”, which just means the first element"
85.429,3.43,in the array is at an index of 0.
88.859,4.08,"This can often confuse new programmers, because
if you want to retrieve the second element,"
92.939,4.651,"you have to use its index, which is 1, not
2."
97.59,4.37,"While the advantage of arrays is that it makes
it easy to read elements (O(1)), the disadvantage"
101.96,3.909,"is that they have a slightly harder time inserting
or deleting elements (O(n))."
105.869,2.081,"Now, just a quick note."
107.95,4.089,"We won’t talk about memory much in this
video, but for the first two data structures"
112.039,4.341,"in this video, the memory component is very
simple, and important so you can tell the"
116.38,1.489,difference between them.
117.869,4.401,"We’ll use our temperature array from earlier
as an example."
122.27,4.099,"Arrays are stored in contiguous memory, which
means each of the elements in the array are"
126.369,2.61,next to one another in memory.
128.979,5.691,"If a new element is added in the middle of
the array, the entire array must shift down."
134.67,4.34,"But what would’ve happened if there was
already something in the next memory address?"
139.01,4.96,"To fit this new element in now, the array’s
memory will have to be reallocated to an entirely"
143.97,3.45,new space where all of the elements fit.
147.42,5.12,"While computers are incredibly quick, this
is not very efficient."
152.54,4.64,"Arrays are very good for reading elements,
but can a bit less efficient when it comes"
157.18,1.889,to insertion or deletion.
159.069,4.87,"Now we’ll take a look at a data structure
that’s the opposite."
163.939,5.971,"Linked Lists
While arrays were fast at reading elements,"
169.91,5.579,"and a bit slower at inserting or deleting,
linked lists are a bit slower at reading elements,"
175.489,3.58,but fast at inserting or deleting.
179.069,5.611,"Linked lists are similar to arrays, in that
they also store ordered lists of data elements."
184.68,5.0,"However, a huge difference is in the way they
are stored in memory."
189.68,4.669,"Each element of a linked list has what we
call a pointer, which is basically the address"
194.349,3.201,of the next element of the list.
197.55,5.36,"As a result, elements in a linked list do
not have to be stored beside each other."
202.91,4.53,"You can store the next element in any location,
and the previous element will point to it"
207.44,2.82,if you want to find it.
210.26,5.47,"The advantage of this is that it solves our
problem with array insertions and deletions."
215.73,4.37,"To add a new element, you find a free spot
in memory for it, and have the previous element"
220.1,2.56,point to it.
222.66,4.34,"To remove an element, you just delete the
element and have the previous point to the"
227.0,3.72,one ahead of the deleted element.
230.72,5.62,"The disadvantage of this is that linked lists
do not have indexes, as the elements are not"
236.34,2.59,stored right beside each other.
238.93,5.149,"This means that to find an element, we have
to go through the list starting from the beginning."
244.079,5.02,"If we want the third element, we have to first
look at the first element, see where it points,"
249.099,4.991,"go to the second, see where it points, and
then we find the third."
254.09,4.49,"If you think of a huge linked list, you can
start to understand why it’s not the fastest"
258.58,1.04,at reading.
259.62,2.21,"So, to recap."
261.83,4.8,"Arrays are faster when it comes to reading,
linked lists are faster when it comes to inserting"
266.63,2.9,and deleting.
269.53,4.601,"HashMap
Remember how arrays had values stored, and"
274.131,2.979,"for each value, there was an index that numbered
them?"
277.11,4.86,"Well, hash maps are essentially the same thing,
except that you can choose what the “index”"
281.97,3.66,"is, which hash maps call a key."
285.63,4.53,"The key and it’s value are commonly known
as key-value pairs."
290.16,6.12,"The other major difference between arrays
and hash maps is that hash maps are unordered."
296.28,3.73,"Hash maps are fast (O(1)) for both inserting
and removing elements."
300.01,4.07,"But the real benefit to using hash maps is
their ability to search quickly (O(1))."
304.08,4.02,"Let’s say you wanted to store a list of
capital cities."
308.1,4.08,"If we stored these in an array, we would have
to know the index for each one to read it."
312.18,5.73,"But for a hash map, if we make the keys countries,
we can just look up the country to find the"
317.91,2.53,capital city.
320.44,2.12,Hash maps go by a few different names.
322.56,5.57,"They are sometimes called hash tables, or,
if you know Python, they’re called dictionaries."
328.13,3.75,"For the purposes of this video, you can assume
they’re all the same thing."
331.88,3.78,"So, if you know how to use dictionaries in
Python, congratulations!"
335.66,1.89,You’ve actually been using hash maps.
337.55,6.35,"The way hash maps work underneath the hood
is really interesting, but a bit out of the"
343.9,1.47,scope of this video.
345.37,5.01,"I’ll be making specific videos for all of
the data structures, so we’ll cover hash"
350.38,2.33,maps more in-depth there.
352.71,5.22,"For now, just understand that they’re unordered,
and their custom keys allow for very quick"
357.93,1.57,searching.
359.5,5.41,"Stacks & Queues
The most simple way to describe stacks is"
364.91,3.15,to think of a stack of plates or pancakes.
368.06,5.82,"The first plate goes on the bottom, the last
plate goes the top."
373.88,6.65,"Stacks are LIFO structures, which stands for
last in, first out, because the last element"
380.53,3.83,"in is like the last plate that goes on top
the stack."
384.36,6.75,"When you go to grab a plate, this last plate
on top will be the first you take off."
391.11,5.34,"Stacks have three common operations, which
are push, pop, and peek."
396.45,3.79,"Pushing is when you add a new element to the
top of the stack."
400.24,3.35,"Popping is when you remove the top-most element
from the stack."
403.59,3.37,"And peeking is when you’re just taking a
look at what the element at the top of the"
406.96,1.4,stack is.
408.36,4.86,"All of these are very fast, which is why stacks
are optimal for certain problems."
413.22,4.27,"If you’re wondering when stacks might be
used, think of the pancake and plate examples."
417.49,5.06,"For any scenario that has a similar structure
where the last element in is the first element"
422.55,5.01,"out, stacks are likely a good data structure
to use."
427.56,2.44,Queues are the opposites of stacks.
430.0,4.36,"The simplest way to think of a queue is like
a lineup at a grocery store."
434.36,4.54,"The first person in the line will get serviced
first, and every additional person who joins"
438.9,2.64,the line goes at the end.
441.54,5.38,"Queues are FIFO structures, which stands for
first in, first out, because the first element"
446.92,3.6,in is the first element to come out.
450.52,6.29,"Queues have very similar operations to stacks,
which are enqueue, dequeue, and front."
456.81,4.501,"Enqueue is like push for a stack, and is when
a new element is added to the back of the"
461.311,1.059,queue.
462.37,6.89,"Dequeue is like pop for a stack, and is when
the element on the front of the queue is removed."
469.26,3.95,"Front is like peek for a stack, and is when
you take a look at the front-most element"
473.21,1.24,in the queue.
474.45,4.85,"Queues are more frequently used than stacks,
especially in real-world programming."
479.3,2.56,Think of YouTube playlists.
481.86,3.99,"When you start watching a playlist, you’ll
start with the video that was added first,"
485.85,7.8,"and the last video you watch will be the final
one that was added."
493.65,2.52,"Trees
Trees are a category of data structure that,"
496.17,3.47,"as you might have guessed by the name, resemble
trees."
499.64,4.35,"Trees have nodes, which are connected to each
other by edges."
503.99,3.76,"The first node in a tree is called the root
node."
507.75,5.4,"Nodes have a parent-child direction, where
one is a parent node that leads to another"
513.15,2.48,"node, which is a child node."
515.63,6.509,"Sometimes, the parent nodes are sometimes
just called nodes, and the child nodes are"
522.139,1.27,called leaves.
523.409,3.97,"There are tons of tree-based data structures,
but in this video, we’ll be talking about"
527.379,4.21,"binary trees, and in particular, binary search
trees."
531.589,4.821,"A binary tree is a tree where each parent
node has up to two children nodes."
536.41,6.5,"A binary search tree is a type of binary tree,
where all left children nodes are less than"
542.91,5.34,"the parent node, and all right children nodes
are greater than the parent node."
548.25,4.31,"These binary search trees make it very easy
to search through large amounts of ordered"
552.56,1.24,values.
553.8,4.15,"The classic example is to think of a number
guessing game, where one person thinks of"
557.95,5.199,"a number between 1 and 100, and the other
person has to guess."
563.149,4.24,"With each guess, they get told whether the
correct number is higher or lower than their"
567.389,1.291,guess.
568.68,3.33,"The strategy is to always guess the middle
number, because then you’re eliminating"
572.01,3.1,the most amount possible each time.
575.11,2.07,This is what a binary search tree does.
577.18,5.389,"We can eliminate a parent node and everything
below it or above it, and continue that process"
582.569,2.081,until we get to our correct number.
584.65,2.28,This is not only useful for this game though.
586.93,5.149,"A more practical example is to think of a
digital dictionary."
592.079,2.86,"Dictionaries have over 100,000 words."
594.939,4.621,"If you give a computer a word, and want it
to give you the definition, it would be incredibly"
599.56,3.769,"slow for it to start at the beginning and
look through each word until it finds the"
603.329,1.711,correct one (O(n)).
605.04,4.56,"Instead, because the dictionary is sorted
alphabetically, the computer is able to go"
609.6,4.679,"right to the word in the middle of the dictionary,
and check if the target word comes before"
614.279,1.641,or after.
615.92,3.37,"It continues sorting like this until it reaches
the word (O(logn))."
619.29,4.58,"There are tons of other tree-structures like
heaps and tries, but we’ll leave those for"
623.87,4.409,another video.
628.279,6.521,"Graphs
Lastly we have graphs."
634.8,3.849,Graphs are basically models for a set of connections.
638.649,3.771,"Like trees, graphs are made up of nodes and
edges."
642.42,6.69,"In fact, trees, and even linked lists to an
extent, are technically types of graphs."
649.11,3.63,But graphs can get a lot more complicated.
652.74,4.77,"In a graph, there are less restrictions than
with trees."
657.51,3.22,Nodes can be connected to any amount of neighbours.
660.73,5.56,"Graphs can be directed, where nodes point
to other nodes, but they can also be undirected."
666.29,4.149,"Some graphs have cycles, where two nodes both
point to each other."
670.439,5.421,"The edges between nodes can also be weighted,
where the path has a value associated with"
675.86,1.05,it.
676.91,4.55,"As you can see, graphs are very complicated,
which is why many people consider them to"
681.46,2.17,be one of the hardest data structures to learn.
683.63,5.829,"I’m going to make an entirely separate video
dedicated to graphs, so we’ll tackle the"
689.459,2.541,complexities in a little bit.
692.0,4.699,"For now, let’s see an example where graphs
are useful data structures."
696.699,4.64,"Imagine you’re running errands, and you
have five different stores to visit."
701.339,6.54,"We can represent this as a graph, where each
store is a node, and each edge has a distance."
707.879,3.871,"Using this data structure, we can develop
an algorithm that allows us to calculate what"
711.75,3.6,"the shortest route between all five places
is."
715.35,3.279,"For a real-life example, think of Uber."
718.629,5.051,"Every Uber driver and user could be seen as
nodes, and the application is constantly trying"
723.68,5.959,"to optimize so that the waiting time for each
rider is as short as possible."
729.639,4.18,"There are endless applications for graphs,
which is why they’re such an important data"
733.819,1.0,structure to understand.
