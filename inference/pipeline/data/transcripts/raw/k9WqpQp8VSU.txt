second,duration,transcript
0.0,3.919,with just a laptop internet and lines of
2.0,3.52,code you can create something truly zero
3.919,2.96,to one learning to code is one of the
5.52,3.28,best things you can do if i could go
6.879,3.521,back in time this is exactly how i would
8.8,4.4,do it i'll break up this video into
10.4,4.64,three big chunks the mindset coding and
13.2,3.28,the developer environment everything i'm
15.04,3.04,gonna tell you is paralyzable which
16.48,3.36,means there's no real order and if
18.08,3.68,you're not in college or a boot camp
19.84,3.359,great this video is tailored for you
21.76,2.8,it's definitely harder but if you're
23.199,3.201,willing to put in the work you can
24.56,3.28,definitely learn how to code by yourself
26.4,3.36,in fact if i could go back i don't know
27.84,5.12,if i would have gone to college let's
29.76,4.959,get into it part one your mindset coders
32.96,3.759,think differently we approach our lives
34.719,4.0,and problems in a certain way and i can
36.719,3.921,confidently say my day-to-day life is
38.719,5.52,different now than my software engineer
40.64,5.439,step 1.1 adopt a coding mindset and what
44.239,3.921,i mean by that is for every problem
46.079,3.601,inefficiency annoyance in your life you
48.16,3.44,need to think there's a solution for
49.68,4.48,this i just need to find it it might
51.6,4.56,take me minutes hours or even days but
54.16,4.16,if i look hard enough if i try hard
56.16,4.079,enough i will find it and that means
58.32,3.6,google is your best friend your toaster
60.239,3.601,is broken all right pull up youtube and
61.92,3.76,start searching the internet modem is
63.84,3.76,blinking yellow google the serial number
65.68,3.2,and start investigating there's a spider
67.6,3.199,on your house and you want to get rid of
68.88,3.279,it yeah i don't know if google can help
70.799,3.68,you there you might just have to move
72.159,4.401,houses and what i'm saying might sound
74.479,4.081,obvious but it took me years to realize
76.56,3.36,not everyone is like this if you were
78.56,3.28,ever wondering why your parents think
79.92,3.92,you're i.t support well here's your
81.84,3.68,answer your parents can google just as
83.84,3.84,well as you can but they don't believe
85.52,4.32,they can and to be a coder you need to
87.68,3.439,believe you can as a fundamental truth
89.84,2.639,because when it's 4 am and you're
91.119,2.801,working on a programming assignment and
92.479,3.441,you've tried everything but you still
93.92,3.28,can't figure out the bug the only thing
95.92,3.04,that'll keep you going is knowing
97.2,3.44,there's a solution you just need to find
98.96,4.159,it and that brings me to the second part
100.64,4.159,of the coding mindset humility trust me
103.119,3.04,when i was in college at ta sessions i'd
104.799,2.801,be yelling at the top of my lungs
106.159,3.28,there's something wrong with my laptop
107.6,3.839,the code is right i don't know what's
109.439,4.081,going on i don't write buggy code the
111.439,4.081,computer is never wrong and the second i
113.52,3.44,realized that and truly internalized it
115.52,4.16,was the day i started growing in my
116.96,4.88,coding journey step 1.2 learn how to
119.68,4.0,problem solve have you ever wondered how
121.84,3.68,airlines decide which airports to fly
123.68,3.68,from and how shipping providers decide
125.52,3.359,what packages make it on the plane or
127.36,3.36,how classes are scheduled even though
128.879,3.841,there are only so many auditoriums well
130.72,4.159,these are problems solved by algorithms
132.72,4.0,that used to be done by hand i mean some
134.879,4.801,pretty legendary woman got us to the
136.72,5.04,moon with only chalk and blackboards but
139.68,3.68,today the scale is just too massive it
141.76,4.479,would take lifetimes to solve these
143.36,4.8,problems by hand so we code at the end
146.239,3.761,of the day coding is just a tool for
148.16,3.84,problem solving the hard part is the
150.0,3.84,actual problem solving being a good
152.0,3.599,coder means being good at learning
153.84,2.56,picking up new things and technologies
155.599,2.241,quickly
156.4,3.199,understanding that there's a lot out
157.84,4.0,there that you don't know but you can
159.599,4.081,learn it all with some time and patience
161.84,3.52,at every one of my internships and jobs
163.68,3.919,i had no experience with the languages
165.36,4.4,they used c sharp at slumberg and
167.599,4.321,microsoft ruby on rails at gusto and
169.76,3.759,golang get bolt but i learned them all
171.92,3.2,and at hackathons my teammates would
173.519,3.201,want to use buzzwords like machine
175.12,3.039,learning in the cloud and i'd have no
176.72,3.36,idea what they were saying but i'd
178.159,3.601,figure it out and yes you don't have to
180.08,3.2,be a good computer scientist to be a
181.76,4.16,good coder but you do have to be a
183.28,4.319,decent problem solver and hands down the
185.92,4.319,best free resource to improve your
187.599,4.241,problem solving skills is cs50 harvard's
190.239,3.681,introductory computer science course
191.84,4.16,that all incoming freshmen take you have
193.92,4.319,an ivy league education one of the best
196.0,4.56,intro computer science courses out there
198.239,4.561,at your fingertips for free
200.56,4.08,take advantage of it cs50 will give you
202.8,3.84,a broad overview of computer science
204.64,4.56,algorithms and data structures is it
206.64,4.72,necessary to learn how to code no will
209.2,4.0,it help you and accelerate your learning
211.36,4.48,definitely the class is language
213.2,5.759,agnostic you'll be exposed to c sql
215.84,4.64,python javascript html and css all while
218.959,4.401,working on real world problems in
220.48,4.96,biology cryptography finance forensics
223.36,3.84,and gaming what you learn in this course
225.44,3.92,will help you immensely with everything
227.2,3.679,else i'm going to talk about at rice the
229.36,3.599,first computer science class i took
230.879,4.801,freshman year was comp 140 basically
232.959,4.881,rice's version of cs50 and it energized
235.68,4.32,me to continue my coding journey part
237.84,4.08,two learning how to code now that you've
240.0,3.76,adopted the right mindset it's time to
241.92,3.679,learn how to code i can't say the
243.76,4.8,journey will always be rosy but i
245.599,5.2,promise it will be fulfilling step 2.1
248.56,3.44,learn one programming language deeply
250.799,2.64,the language you use to learn
252.0,3.12,programming doesn't have to be the same
253.439,3.601,language you eventually use at work or
255.12,3.679,even in your personal projects but it's
257.04,4.24,good to know one language really well
258.799,4.321,like your go-to if you took cs50 you've
261.28,4.08,been exposed to a bunch of languages but
263.12,3.92,for now i'd recommend python it's the
265.36,3.68,most beginner friendly language and for
267.04,3.68,the most part it reads like english the
269.04,3.76,data structures are really intuitive and
270.72,3.6,it's not verbose it isn't typed which
272.8,3.76,isn't ideal but you can always use
274.32,3.439,linters to optionally add typing and
276.56,2.48,this is probably the language you'll
277.759,3.121,want to use for coding interviews so
279.04,3.76,it's good to get comfortable with it now
280.88,3.759,to actually learn coding in python there
282.8,3.28,are so many great resources out there
284.639,3.441,for now you're going to want to focus on
286.08,3.679,syntax and data structures so follow an
288.08,3.28,online course or look up some tutorials
289.759,4.0,on youtube make sure you learn about
291.36,5.76,control flow so if else statements basic
293.759,5.44,logic and or not loops foreign while
297.12,4.0,loops and objects classes and other
299.199,3.521,object-oriented programming principles
301.12,3.84,in my opinion these are the highest
302.72,3.919,yield topics and for data structures
304.96,3.84,don't worry too much about crazy
306.639,4.961,optimized red black trees and whatnot
308.8,4.64,for now focus on hash maps and arrays
311.6,5.12,once you have a basic command of python
313.44,4.96,move on to the next step step 2.2 learn
316.72,2.88,scripting sometimes there'll be stuff
318.4,2.88,you're doing that will feel really
319.6,3.599,manual like data manipulation or
321.28,4.16,renaming files or sometimes you just
323.199,3.681,want to write code to produce code you
325.44,3.039,can write scripts on your terminal
326.88,3.36,through bash scripts but hopefully by
328.479,3.361,this point you understand some python so
330.24,3.76,you can leverage it to automate some of
331.84,4.079,your daily tasks for example let's say
334.0,3.919,you want to grab data from a csv file
335.919,3.361,and generate an insert sql statement
337.919,3.361,that you can copy paste into your
339.28,3.68,database console and imagine there are
341.28,3.52,no nice libraries that can help you do
342.96,3.679,this it would take hours if you wanted
344.8,3.6,to do this by hand but with a simple
346.639,3.761,python script you can generate this
348.4,3.92,entire command copy paste it into the
350.4,4.0,database console and you're good to go
352.32,4.879,you basically wrote python code to
354.4,4.799,generate an sql query string that's
357.199,3.44,awesome the great thing about scripting
359.199,3.12,is you don't have to spin up a web app
360.639,3.921,or worry about hosting your server you
362.319,3.921,can just write python code and writing
364.56,3.52,more and more python will make you
366.24,3.92,better at it coupled with the coding
368.08,4.399,mindset you now have a practical tool to
370.16,5.039,solve some of your daily problems step
372.479,4.72,2.3 create a personal project the first
375.199,4.241,thing i do is sign up for a hackathon in
377.199,3.521,person is best but virtual is fine too
379.44,3.12,this is much like signing up for a
380.72,3.759,marathon so you feel motivated to go out
382.56,3.52,there and train a hackathon will give
384.479,2.961,you the chance to create a project
386.08,2.88,you'll learn a lot you'll work with
387.44,3.12,other people and it'll give you a taste
388.96,4.0,of what real-life software engineering
390.56,3.759,feels like well except real-life
392.96,3.44,software engineering projects aren't
394.319,3.6,completed in 48 hours and you actually
396.4,3.84,have to test your code and you're not as
397.919,3.681,sleep-deprived but you get my point
400.24,2.959,you'll get a chance to create something
401.6,3.52,that you can deliver to customers in
403.199,3.601,this case the judges i've said this many
405.12,3.359,times in other videos the best way to
406.8,3.04,learn programming is by doing and
408.479,3.521,ideally you work on something you're
409.84,3.759,passionate about so pick a topic you're
412.0,2.479,interested in and build something there
413.599,2.481,are a couple things i think are
414.479,3.28,important here first you're going to
416.08,3.679,want to pick a full stack project which
417.759,4.0,means there's a front end a back end
419.759,3.201,some api message passing layer and then
421.759,2.961,a database to actually store the
422.96,3.359,information you can do everything in
424.72,3.039,python if you want through flask or
426.319,3.681,django but i'd actually recommend
427.759,3.361,learning and using javascript javascript
430.0,2.72,is probably one of the most popular
431.12,4.0,languages out there today and it has
432.72,4.0,great support for front end and back end
435.12,3.12,for the front end i'd recommend react
436.72,3.68,and for the back end some framework
438.24,4.32,around node express is a really popular
440.4,3.84,one like python javascript is not tight
442.56,3.28,so i highly recommend using typescript
444.24,3.359,which is actually what industry uses so
445.84,3.12,it'd be a good precursor anyway the
447.599,3.44,awesome thing here is that there are so
448.96,3.92,many stacks you can use mirn is a really
451.039,3.921,popular one but there's no wrong answers
452.88,3.92,just pick one and dive deep for the
454.96,3.2,message passing api layer probably start
456.8,3.519,off with the rest protocol but if you're
458.16,3.68,feeling extra bold give graphql a try
460.319,3.761,and for the database i'd recommend using
461.84,4.639,mongodb which is very javascripty and
464.08,4.32,json-like or you can use a classic
466.479,3.521,relational database like postgres for
468.4,3.44,the back-end server and database feel
470.0,3.44,free to host everything locally but for
471.84,3.759,bonus points see if you can set up your
473.44,3.84,infrastructure in aws azure or some
475.599,3.361,other cloud provider because that's how
477.28,3.52,they do it in industry if you're not
478.96,3.44,feeling particularly inspired here's a
480.8,3.44,project i think gives you the most bang
482.4,3.28,for your buck implement a stateful
484.24,3.28,counter which means the front end will
485.68,3.28,have a number a plus sign and a minus
487.52,3.2,sign to increment and decrement the
488.96,3.76,counter and maybe a reset button to set
490.72,3.68,it back to zero and stateful means if
492.72,3.28,you close the app and reopen it the
494.4,3.359,count should continue from where it left
496.0,3.12,off and this will force you to use a
497.759,3.44,database to actually store the
499.12,4.72,information these are called crud apps
501.199,4.481,for create read update delete the four
503.84,3.84,basic functionalities any feature can
505.68,3.84,have by implementing this you'll get
507.68,3.519,experience across the stack and have a
509.52,5.199,real-world project to show for your
511.199,4.881,efforts step 2.4 practice for interviews
514.719,2.56,if you're watching this video chances
516.08,2.959,are at some point you want to get a
517.279,2.56,full-time software engineering job and
519.039,2.48,that means you're gonna have to do
519.839,3.68,coding interviews and remember when i
521.519,4.161,said just focus on python syntax and
523.519,3.521,hashmaps and arrays well i wasn't lying
525.68,2.719,by now you have a good grasp of the
527.04,3.28,fundamentals so you're ready to pick up
528.399,3.281,an interview book and start practicing
530.32,2.72,the classic book everyone knows is
531.68,3.2,cracking the coding interview but it's
533.04,3.2,honestly not my favorite the solutions
534.88,3.28,are in java which is completely
536.24,3.76,unnecessary since java is such a verbose
538.16,3.2,language i'd actually recommend elements
540.0,2.56,of python programming since the
541.36,3.12,solutions will be in python and you're
542.56,3.279,already familiar with the language for
544.48,4.0,interviews you'll need to be familiar
545.839,5.12,with strings arrays hash maps trees
548.48,4.0,graphs queues stacks tries and heaps
550.959,3.201,along with some basic algorithms like
552.48,3.84,breadth first search depth first search
554.16,3.92,and some other basic sorts and searches
556.32,3.68,i know it sounds like a lot but you can
558.08,4.08,get there with some practice chances
560.0,4.08,you'll use any of this at the actual job
562.16,4.239,close to zero chances you see these
564.08,3.92,concepts in interviews pretty high you
566.399,3.44,should also learn recursion and practice
568.0,4.0,it don't worry if you struggle i
569.839,3.281,struggle to this day to truly prepare
572.0,2.64,for interviews i'd recommend doing
573.12,2.88,practice problems on league code and
574.64,2.639,using these sites that allow you to mock
576.0,3.44,interview other people and have them
577.279,4.161,mock interview you part three your
579.44,3.36,developer experience now this isn't
581.44,3.04,technically coding but it's almost
582.8,3.36,impossible to code without a solid
584.48,3.039,developer environment and remember
586.16,2.72,there's a stark distinction between
587.519,2.801,writing code just to pass a coding
588.88,3.28,assignment and building something in the
590.32,3.36,real world in a production environment
592.16,2.56,so honestly i think getting comfortable
593.68,2.56,with the tooling you're going to end up
594.72,4.08,using every day is probably the best
596.24,4.24,investment you can make step 3.1 learn
598.8,3.52,the terminal you're going to code on
600.48,3.52,your laptop right now you probably drag
602.32,3.36,and drop things into windows and right
604.0,3.6,click to find what you were trying to do
605.68,3.52,and don't worry i was just like you but
607.6,3.679,those days are gone or they should be
609.2,3.92,gone if you're trying to seriously code
611.279,3.521,just like command c is way better than
613.12,3.04,right clicking and hitting copy
614.8,3.12,navigating on your laptop through your
616.16,3.76,terminal is way more efficient than
617.92,3.84,using the user interface you know those
619.92,3.84,hackers you see in movies coding really
621.76,3.199,fast well all that is fake but the one
623.76,3.199,thing they got right is that they're
624.959,3.44,using the terminal and i promise you
626.959,2.801,sooner or later you're gonna have to get
628.399,2.961,comfortable with the terminal so you
629.76,3.199,might as well start now couple things
631.36,3.919,here if you're on windows i'm just gonna
632.959,4.241,say it the command line is not it the
635.279,3.601,linux flavoring is way nicer so i'd
637.2,3.84,highly recommend you get the bash
638.88,4.079,subsystem for linux and if you're on mac
641.04,3.76,i'd highly recommend using itunes ii
642.959,3.12,it's way nicer than the default terminal
644.8,2.8,now you have a couple options you can
646.079,3.281,use the default shell which is usually
647.6,4.56,bash or you can use some wrapper like
649.36,4.8,zish oh my zis or fish no hard opinions
652.16,3.359,here but just pick one and learn it and
654.16,3.2,if it makes a difference i personally
655.519,4.161,use oh my zish get comfortable with the
657.36,5.76,package manager and commands like sudo
659.68,5.52,ls mv rm and so on and the best way to
663.12,4.0,do this is to force yourself to only use
665.2,3.12,the terminal to navigate on your laptop
667.12,2.64,it's like when right-handed people want
668.32,3.12,to become ambidextrous they start
669.76,2.96,brushing with their left hand let's say
671.44,2.88,you want to move a bunch of files to a
672.72,3.52,new directory and then open that folder
674.32,3.84,in an editor cool you can do it on the
676.24,3.2,terminal the terminal can be gnarly and
678.16,2.799,you might have to google a bunch and
679.44,4.72,resolve all these dependencies but
680.959,5.12,that's great more practice step 3.2
684.16,4.0,learn your way around an editor i'm not
686.079,3.76,a vim or emax power user and i'm not
688.16,4.0,going to debate you on tabs versus
689.839,5.281,spaces i mean i do not get why anyone
692.16,5.28,would use spaces over tabs i mean why
695.12,5.12,not just use vim over emacs
697.44,4.079,i do use vim over emac oh god help us
700.24,3.039,but trust me you're going to want to
701.519,3.681,know your way around a coding editor my
703.279,3.841,go-to in college was sublime but
705.2,3.68,honestly looking back hands down the
707.12,4.0,best open source editor out there today
708.88,3.6,is vs code so download it and start
711.12,3.92,navigating around check out some
712.48,4.08,extensions like prettier and eslint and
715.04,2.88,browse through some themes and other
716.56,3.04,settings and really just get comfortable
717.92,3.76,with the whole environment i'd also
719.6,4.96,recommend any jetbrains ide like
721.68,4.32,intellij for java or goland for golang
724.56,3.2,you're gonna have to buy a license but
726.0,4.48,these editors are powerful and they can
727.76,4.4,level up your coding ability step 3.3
730.48,3.52,learn git and become familiar with
732.16,3.6,version control if you've gotten this
734.0,2.8,far you probably know what git is you
735.76,3.28,might have seen it while playing around
736.8,4.4,in the terminal or used it in cs50 or
739.04,3.68,used it during a personal project git is
741.2,3.199,just a version control tool that allows
742.72,3.6,you to save checkpoints of your work
744.399,3.361,you'll definitely use git or some other
746.32,3.36,source control tool throughout your
747.76,3.36,career i remember in my first hackathon
749.68,3.12,we were all coding all night and then we
751.12,3.2,were finally ready to integrate our work
752.8,3.52,and merge all our changes together and
754.32,3.759,we screwed up some git command and lost
756.32,3.44,everything i'm not gonna lie i'm still
758.079,3.921,not the most proficient with git but you
759.76,5.28,really only have to know the basics get
762.0,5.839,pull merge rebase commit push that's
765.04,4.239,about it just remember git commit often
767.839,2.881,and you'll thank me later and while
769.279,2.721,you're at it check out github either for
770.72,3.2,your own personal project or just to
772.0,3.68,check out an open source repository you
773.92,3.599,can see issues pull requests and the
775.68,3.2,entire code base which is pretty cool
777.519,2.481,and this is just a nice to have but
778.88,2.639,check out the readme because it's
780.0,3.2,usually written in markdown which is a
781.519,4.641,pretty sweet language to format plain
783.2,4.72,text congrats by this point you're well
786.16,3.28,on your way to becoming a coder you
787.92,3.2,think about things the right way you
789.44,3.519,have the drive and patience to stick
791.12,3.76,with it and you truly believe in your
792.959,3.841,heart of hearts that you can do it and
794.88,3.68,you know python and javascript you have
796.8,3.279,some projects under your belt and you
798.56,3.44,have a sound understanding of data
800.079,3.44,structures and algorithms you're ready
802.0,3.279,for interviews and whatever else the
803.519,3.201,world throws at you i want to wish you
805.279,3.041,good luck with everything that is to
806.72,3.52,come and just like everything else in
808.32,3.84,life it's the journey that matters not
810.24,4.32,the end result take a moment to see how
812.16,4.4,far you've come i'm proud of you
814.56,6.36,keep at it that's all i have for today
816.56,4.36,until next time cheers
