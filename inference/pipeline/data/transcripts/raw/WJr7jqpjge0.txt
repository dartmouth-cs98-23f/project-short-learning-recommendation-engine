11.44,2.48,well congratulations you've almost made
13.519,3.84,it
13.92,6.56,almost welcome to our
17.359,4.961,last lecture lecture eight in which we
20.48,3.68,are going to talk about quantum error
22.32,3.279,correction how to deal with quantum
24.16,4.8,noise how to
25.599,6.241,recover quantum states and protect our
28.96,4.48,precious quantum computations or quantum
31.84,4.08,communication
33.44,4.4,it's been long journey we started with
35.92,5.04,four introductory lectures where i
37.84,5.36,introduced some basic stuff for
40.96,3.759,you to understand why quantum
43.2,4.32,information processing is
44.719,4.401,uh more powerful so we talk about
47.52,3.679,quantum interference we talk about
49.12,5.36,quantum entanglement
51.199,4.88,and then we we we could see how quantum
54.48,3.52,interference and quantum entanglement
56.079,6.561,play a significant role
58.0,8.159,in making quantum communication secure
62.64,7.04,or computation more powerful
66.159,6.0,but we also observed that the reason
69.68,5.04,we do not have for example quantum
72.159,4.64,computers yet is because
74.72,3.12,quantum systems or quantum interference
76.799,4.241,in particular is
77.84,6.319,is quite fragile right so you
81.04,4.96,expose it to any interaction with the
84.159,4.64,environment the environment may learn
86.0,5.2,about the state of the system and
88.799,6.0,quantum interference is gone
91.2,6.959,um so we took some time to describe
94.799,4.561,the system environment kind of
98.159,4.801,interaction so that
99.36,5.439,is the dynamics of open quantum systems
102.96,3.76,our quantum computers or quantum
104.799,3.36,communication devices are open quantum
106.72,3.2,system because
108.159,3.6,even though we can control them to some
109.92,3.839,extent they're embedded in
111.759,5.281,some sort of environment which upon
113.759,6.32,which we do not have complete control
117.04,4.56,so um it's it's not quite right to
120.079,5.201,describe the evolution of
121.6,5.76,open quantum system as a as a unitary
125.28,4.08,evolution we know that you can take two
127.36,3.92,approaches here right so you can
129.36,4.32,think about the unit evolution of the
131.28,4.88,whole when you include the environment
133.68,3.919,that's the so-called stein spring
136.16,3.2,representation
137.599,3.441,but you can also look at the system
139.36,4.4,alone and
141.04,4.0,analyze the evolution of of such system
143.76,3.36,in the presence of vine
145.04,3.6,of the environment but not necessarily
147.12,3.52,just including the environment
148.64,4.4,in in your equation so that's the
150.64,5.599,crowd's representation
153.04,3.52,now we have the tools so we can now move
156.239,3.841,on
156.56,6.8,and discuss how we can
160.08,6.48,deal with quantum errors so whenever
163.36,4.239,remember we call kraus operators quantum
166.56,4.72,errors
167.599,6.401,um but um
171.28,3.039,the question really is so given a system
174.0,3.599,that
174.319,5.521,undergoes some sort of
177.599,3.441,evolution described by a completely
179.84,4.72,positive map
181.04,5.76,is it possible to recover
184.56,3.759,the original state of the system so i
186.8,4.88,would like you to have
188.319,4.241,this kind of uh scenario in mind so
191.68,2.88,compare
192.56,4.0,the two cases the case where we have a
194.56,3.92,system let's say it's a cube it is
196.56,3.599,you can always choose the simplest
198.48,2.72,possible quantum system so we have a
200.159,4.64,qubit
201.2,5.84,this qubit undergoes the coherence so
204.799,5.041,interacts with the environment
207.04,4.72,and as a result the state of the qubit
209.84,6.479,is modified in
211.76,8.32,in some way now is there
216.319,6.961,a way to diminish the impact
220.08,6.96,of the environment and here we are
223.28,7.599,going to borrow ideas from classical
227.04,6.8,theory of information so we are going to
230.879,3.761,use the concept of error correcting
233.84,3.44,codes
234.64,3.679,so instead of this kind of scenario we
237.28,4.48,are going to
238.319,6.56,encode the state of the qubit
241.76,5.679,into a number of qubits so we are going
244.879,6.0,to bring a few more qubits
247.439,5.681,and take our original qubit
250.879,4.321,and we are going to perform a unitary
253.12,6.079,operation
255.2,7.999,maps unknown state of the qubit
259.199,9.521,into a set of
263.199,7.761,cubits that will form our encoded qubit
268.72,3.28,so this mathematically speaking we are
270.96,3.76,just going to
272.0,3.12,pick up a two-dimensional hilbert space
274.72,3.44,um
275.12,4.639,and we are going to embed it in a higher
278.16,4.72,dimensional hilbert space
279.759,3.44,rotate somehow that's isometry right so
282.88,3.759,that
283.199,6.56,that's going to be the an encoding part
286.639,8.161,and then all the qubits go to
289.759,6.561,the coherence area so arrows will appear
294.8,4.32,and then at this point you may be a
296.32,4.879,little bit um
299.12,5.04,confused you say okay well now the
301.199,6.161,errors will appear on many qubits
304.16,6.879,well yes but
307.36,4.96,if you just take quantum state of one
311.039,5.281,qubit
312.32,7.36,and somehow spread this state
316.32,5.92,number of qubits then the error on one
319.68,5.359,qubit may not perhaps be so significant
322.24,5.12,it may be possible to recover it under
325.039,4.801,certain conditions and indeed
327.36,4.0,we will see that under certain
329.84,5.28,conditions
331.36,6.16,it is possible to recover to reverse
335.12,4.079,this completely positive map so the
337.52,4.0,first one
339.199,3.361,the errors are induced by the
341.52,4.239,environment
342.56,5.919,which you cannot control but
345.759,4.0,as long as you can find out roughly what
348.479,4.881,happened
349.759,5.44,then you can then just um apply another
353.36,3.36,completely positive map
355.199,3.761,in this case we don't have the
356.72,5.28,environment but we just bring
358.96,5.92,extra even more qubits or some other
362.0,4.88,quantum systems auxiliary qubits are a
364.88,2.96,system that we call ancilla a kind of a
366.88,3.599,helper to
367.84,3.68,help us to perform in a controlled way
370.479,3.201,another
371.52,4.48,completely positive map so that's going
373.68,4.88,to be error recovery
376.0,4.08,and then once hopefully we managed to
378.56,5.12,recover the original state
380.08,8.8,of all those qubits then we just simply
383.68,9.68,decode the quantum state so we just
388.88,6.96,map the state into the
393.36,5.04,qubit and hopefully we'll have something
395.84,5.04,that is very close to the original
398.4,3.359,so i would like you to have this
400.88,3.36,scenario
401.759,4.56,in mind and of course you know in the
404.24,3.92,lecture we will go through
406.319,3.28,all the details and i'm going to tell
408.16,5.2,you how to encode
409.599,4.561,how to um construct the recovery
413.36,4.0,procedure
414.16,4.64,and how we are going to
417.36,3.44,what kind of conditions have to be
418.8,3.519,satisfied for this to be possible in the
420.8,4.799,first place
422.319,5.28,then we'll say a few words about quantum
425.599,5.281,computation that
427.599,5.281,protects about a way of computing that
430.88,4.159,you protect not only quantum state but
432.88,3.84,also the whole process of computation so
435.039,4.081,you would like to have your
436.72,3.919,evolving state modified by your quantum
439.12,5.6,logic case protected at
440.639,6.481,all time well so this will
444.72,5.12,essentially this will actually um
447.12,4.56,conclude our basic introduction to
449.84,3.919,quantum information processing it should
451.68,5.44,give you some sort of
453.759,8.72,simple but complete
457.12,5.359,picture of how things work
