8.2,4.76,interfaces
9.599,6.24,are important they're all around us
12.96,5.68,we use them when we go to work we get a
15.839,5.841,train ticket or when we drive our car
18.64,4.719,and we call people when we communicate
21.68,4.24,for work and for pleasure
23.359,3.441,and we do that increasingly from our
25.92,3.679,laptops
26.8,3.76,our smartphones our smart watches and
29.599,4.64,other
30.56,4.24,modern technology user interfaces
34.239,3.84,connect
34.8,4.64,us with function and with data through
38.079,4.961,technology
39.44,6.08,this program is all about that
43.04,4.16,it is about user interface design like
45.52,3.92,hci and ux
47.2,3.999,paired with software engineering
49.44,4.32,software development to realize
51.199,4.641,to turn them into reality it's about
53.76,3.439,integrating data so we want to visualize
55.84,3.92,data and data and forms
57.199,3.921,interfaces and what we do it helps us
59.76,3.439,making decisions
61.12,3.679,so we have a component of data science
63.199,4.081,and visualization in there
64.799,3.441,and we connect that with a wide range of
67.28,6.56,technology
68.24,5.6,mobile devices virtual augmented reality
76.88,3.76,you have a wide range of practical
78.96,3.68,subjects that include
80.64,4.24,such things as web development and
82.64,5.44,interaction design so you learn about
84.88,5.12,web frameworks javascript html
88.08,3.84,mobile development so mobile application
90.0,3.68,development and mobile platforms
91.92,3.04,multimedia technology so everything
93.68,5.16,about
94.96,6.159,images video audio virtual reality 3d
98.84,4.2,environments we have a specific module
101.119,3.36,about virtual reality augmented reality
103.04,3.759,and mixed reality
104.479,4.32,we cover machine learning artificial
106.799,5.28,intelligence and data analytics
108.799,4.561,and also ethical questions minute
112.079,3.921,university has
113.36,3.28,20 years of experience in these areas
116.0,3.759,including
116.64,5.6,hci software development and
119.759,3.521,data analytics ai machine learning we
122.24,3.44,also collaborate
123.28,4.24,with the philosophy department on
125.68,4.88,questions of ethics
127.52,5.28,and minout university itself lies at the
130.56,4.24,center of a very vibrant town with a
132.8,5.36,very large student population and a
134.8,7.2,wonderful and beautiful campus
138.16,6.4,this is a one-year full-time program
142.0,4.319,funded by the human capital initiative
144.56,5.2,and it is funded to prepare
146.319,4.56,graduates to design and to develop and
149.76,4.08,to evaluate
150.879,3.281,user interfaces with modern applications
153.84,2.74,and
154.16,7.84,modern technology
156.58,8.299,[Music]
162.0,4.64,you need to have a completed three-year
164.879,4.241,undergraduate degree
166.64,4.4,but it does not have to be in computer
169.12,3.68,science you can have a wide range of
171.04,4.16,backgrounds for that degree
172.8,4.799,including computing you can also enter
175.2,4.959,the program through the recognition of
177.599,4.241,prior experiential learning it is open
180.159,3.44,for unemployed
181.84,3.84,for the self-employed or formally
183.599,4.161,self-employed the returners
185.68,3.44,when you're a recent graduate you can
187.76,3.119,apply for this program
189.12,9.44,and you can also apply when you're
190.879,11.201,employed and you want to upscale
198.56,5.599,graduates typically find work as ux or
202.08,5.2,user experience designers
204.159,6.561,as human factors engineers work in
207.28,5.44,hci or being information architects
210.72,3.04,but the skill set itself has these
212.72,4.56,different areas
213.76,4.08,you can work in hci emphasized area you
217.28,2.56,can
217.84,4.24,shift further towards software
219.84,5.36,engineering and software development
222.08,5.76,you can move closer into the data
225.2,3.44,science aspect that the program contains
227.84,3.44,or you
228.64,5.04,you can move closer to technology or any
231.28,3.599,combinations or any degree of that in
233.68,4.32,some combination
234.879,15.121,which should allow you to give you
238.0,12.0,many options for your future career
