second,duration,transcript
12.78,6.18,all right well welcome to cs224 I
16.02,4.919,recognize most of your faces from cs223
18.96,3.659,thank you for coming to the class on the
20.939,3.0,first day uh we'll do an introduction
22.619,3.121,today a little bit about the
23.939,3.361,administration of the course
25.74,4.199,um and then we'll start the lesson with
27.3,4.26,the material from chapter one usually
29.939,3.12,chapter one is an introduction to the
31.56,4.2,whole topic that's what it's going to be
33.059,4.221,here today so I can say that it's a good
35.76,4.38,uh
37.28,4.54,you know overview of the material it's
40.14,3.66,not necessarily going to be on the exam
41.82,3.66,and there will be a simple homework
43.8,3.96,probably from chapter one but it's not
45.48,5.099,hard it's more to help you get a
47.76,3.9,engineer's perspective about computers
50.579,2.581,um
51.66,4.02,so while we're waiting
53.16,4.559,um I guess I'll introduce myself I'm
55.68,4.08,will Sawyer I've taught at bill can for
57.719,3.48,10 years I'm an American I do speak
59.76,3.54,Turkish but I'm not allowed to in the
61.199,4.441,classroom as you know please don't try
63.3,4.92,to get me to tell Turkish jokes and be
65.64,5.4,funny most of the recent students laugh
68.22,4.68,is not because my Turkish is funny it's
71.04,4.2,because me speaking Turkish I speak it
72.9,7.2,in a funny way so it's not do all of
75.24,6.78,course but anyway I think if you uh tune
80.1,3.659,into my English it is a little bit fast
82.02,4.38,it's natural speed but if you tune into
83.759,4.141,my English you'll get the tempo if
86.4,3.48,you're having trouble understanding my
87.9,3.48,language do raise your hand and say Hojo
89.88,3.599,can you please say it again or slow down
91.38,3.84,hold you or repeat it a different way
93.479,3.361,I'm happy to do that the goal here is
95.22,4.079,for you to understand it's not for me to
96.84,4.44,get up here and run through you know 50
99.299,4.32,slides and give a good performance it's
101.28,4.379,for you to learn the goal of being here
103.619,3.36,is for you to learn so I'm here to
105.659,3.42,assist that learning they call me a
106.979,5.1,teacher but I don't think that I teach
109.079,4.561,so much as I think you learn so I'm the
112.079,3.661,help with the learning process that's my
113.64,3.96,job
115.74,4.26,we're going to use PowerPoint slides
117.6,3.9,quite a bit in this course but there'll
120.0,3.42,be times when we do some other things as
121.5,5.219,well but the opening lecture today will
123.42,4.979,be pretty much from the slides I'd like
126.719,3.24,to get a class discussion going I'd like
128.399,5.521,to ask questions but I've had a hard
129.959,6.061,time finding students responding so when
133.92,3.72,there's that awkward silence and hoja
136.02,3.24,asks a question please don't be afraid
137.64,3.12,to be the first one raise your hand and
139.26,2.76,say yeah I think this maybe it's wrong
140.76,3.3,maybe it's right but here's my opinion
142.02,4.079,here's my idea I'll really appreciate
144.06,4.86,that that's what we'd like as a dialogue
146.099,4.201,and for you to be thinking I've said it
148.92,3.539,many times before but I'll say it again
150.3,3.9,because it Bears worth saying you can
152.459,3.661,watch a lot of movies and not learn
154.2,4.2,anything about how to make movies and so
156.12,3.839,if you're here to watch a course go by
158.4,3.72,you're probably not going to learn very
159.959,3.661,much about computer organization but if
162.12,3.479,you're participating as an active
163.62,6.36,learner I'm sure that you'll learn much
165.599,6.901,more so that's the own says
169.98,5.78,let's see if we can find our PowerPoint
172.5,3.26,slides and begin
177.84,3.66,okay I think everybody knows but if you
179.76,3.839,go to the course homepages on our
181.5,4.739,Department's site you see every single
183.599,7.22,course and this is cs224 so here's the
186.239,8.161,home page for cs224 for this semester
190.819,4.721,like the homepage for 223 the recent
194.4,2.88,announcements will be found here
195.54,3.66,anything that's important let's go see
197.28,3.36,if there's anything important to learn
199.2,5.22,oh my goodness there's already
200.64,5.519,announcements oh boy it has begun the
204.42,3.84,syllabus shows the readings for each
206.159,4.561,week and there's already an assignment
208.26,3.96,to read chapter one and follow along it
210.72,3.84,supplements the introduction that I'll
212.22,4.26,be giving in class and to be prepared
214.56,4.02,for each week you should do the reading
216.48,3.72,in advance of the class next week we'll
218.58,3.9,move into chapter two about Assembly
220.2,4.74,Language so it should read ahead and the
222.48,5.179,textbook for the course is this one the
224.94,4.799,computer organization and design book by
227.659,4.0,Patterson and Hennessey it's in the
229.739,3.78,fourth edition whenever you get a book
231.659,3.78,that's in the fourth fifth sixth seventh
233.519,3.841,edition that tells you that it's quite
235.439,3.3,popular around the world as a textbook
237.36,3.959,this is international student Edition
238.739,4.92,very reasonably priced top quality top
241.319,4.14,shelf best in best in class as far as
243.659,4.321,I'm concerned so we've picked a good one
245.459,3.84,for you you need to get this one fourth
247.98,3.179,edition there are some still some third
249.299,3.36,editions floating around among the
251.159,3.061,students but that's not the one we we
252.659,3.181,have significantly changed from the
254.22,4.38,Third Edition please don't use the Third
255.84,5.639,Edition all right so that's our first
258.6,5.22,little announcements
261.479,4.141,schedules will be posted here for myself
263.82,5.28,and the other teacher but currently
265.62,4.32,they're not right we've got five Tas but
269.1,3.48,there's been a little bit of change
269.94,4.259,there as well your class section is
272.58,4.679,three so we're here on Friday afternoon
274.199,4.621,and the office hours will be posted I'm
277.259,3.601,not exactly sure if I'll be available
278.82,4.56,these hours on Tuesday so there may be
280.86,4.5,some updates but the book has its own
283.38,3.48,website if you click here you go to the
285.36,3.839,website about the book there are
286.86,4.8,resources for students including a
289.199,4.681,solved example problems the code from
291.66,5.22,the book some extra resources lots of
293.88,5.52,stuff here that you can get from this
296.88,4.68,book's website
299.4,3.84,the objectives of the course let's go
301.56,4.079,over what are we trying to achieve in
303.24,3.899,cs224 why are you here because it's
305.639,2.881,required hold you I have to take it
307.139,3.601,that's the only important reason no no
308.52,4.14,no no there's a lot of things that we're
310.74,3.959,going to be hoping to achieve will we
312.66,4.5,achieve everyone in every student no I
314.699,4.801,don't think so but the goal will be that
317.16,4.8,most students achieve most of these
319.5,3.66,objectives so I'll let you study these
321.96,3.54,on your own time to see what we're
323.16,4.259,trying to get but the main idea here is
325.5,3.66,to learn about how computers work
327.419,4.201,computer organization how are they
329.16,4.44,organized what are the structures from a
331.62,3.18,hardware point of view and also from a
333.6,3.36,software point of view what are the
334.8,4.56,structures so this is a the name of our
336.96,5.04,textbook is called computer organization
339.36,4.26,and design the hardware software
342.0,3.78,interface so it's right at the place
343.62,3.84,where software and Hardware meet that's
345.78,3.66,the that's the focus of our course so
347.46,3.78,it'll be both looking up to the software
349.44,3.24,layers and down to the hardware layers
351.24,3.299,and right at that interface that's where
352.68,4.079,the course is aimed at so you can see
354.539,4.621,that after we work on
356.759,4.021,instruction set architectures then we
359.16,3.36,look at processor units especially
360.78,4.44,pipeline then we move into memory and do
362.52,4.08,cache and then some bus and I O issues
365.22,2.759,and then you're going to gain experience
366.6,4.02,in the use of Hardware description
367.979,4.5,languages and tools for Designing
370.62,3.84,computers to be able to explain in an
372.479,3.66,informal interview on a project you know
374.46,4.14,what you've worked on and why you did
376.139,4.021,what you did and practice the skills of
378.6,4.92,project documentation and Technical
380.16,5.34,reporting so again you might say one of
383.52,4.92,my goals in this course is to turn you
385.5,4.62,into an engineer Engineers design they
388.44,4.08,document they give oral presentations
390.12,3.96,they work in teams they do peer review
392.52,4.82,all those will be part of our our
394.08,3.26,courses approach
397.979,4.741,okay the syllabus of the course shows
400.8,3.72,what topics we'll be covering every week
402.72,3.479,well this is a really weird week because
404.52,5.76,it starts on a Friday so I just put
406.199,6.241,Friday on to uh next week but it means
410.28,5.52,that with Friday and next week you have
412.44,6.199,three class sessions and most of the uh
415.8,5.28,topics will only need uh
418.639,4.721,integer multiple of weeks so therefore
421.08,4.32,if this takes one week for the other two
423.36,3.6,sections and we have a week and a half
425.4,3.84,it means we're going to finish early so
426.96,4.62,and the second lecture in each week
429.24,5.16,we'll probably be looking ahead to the
431.58,4.739,next week's material so today and the
434.4,3.239,Tuesday will be Corso review
436.319,3.241,introduction to computer architecture
437.639,4.321,next Friday we'll already be moving up
439.56,3.9,to here the reason is this this section
441.96,3.72,is out of sync with the other two
443.46,3.959,sections because you we start today on a
445.68,3.419,Friday which makes the week weird anyway
447.419,4.021,you can see that we're going to cover
449.099,4.021,the material from the textbook including
451.44,4.44,some appendices in order of the chapters
453.12,5.519,one two three four five six and
455.88,4.5,inshallah if time allows chapter 7 by
458.639,2.84,the end of the course we've not only
460.38,3.9,covered
461.479,4.601,processors and pipelining and memory
464.28,3.72,hierarchies and I O systems then we're
466.08,4.32,moving into multi-processors we'll
468.0,4.319,actually look at multi-core chips and
470.4,4.62,clusters of processors in order to form
472.319,4.56,parallel computers that'll be our end
475.02,6.6,Target by the end of the course so this
476.879,6.781,gives the topics and the readings the
481.62,3.6,schedule for the homeworks on the
483.66,3.24,projects will be announced separately on
485.22,3.3,other web pages I won't try to integrate
486.9,3.9,them here but you can see for each week
488.52,4.799,of the semester I've written something
490.8,4.799,including look at this one spring break
493.319,4.741,week first week of April middle class
495.599,4.561,take a vacation maybe the weather's warm
498.06,4.38,down in the South let's hope so anyway
500.16,4.02,the grading policy everybody's always
502.44,4.379,interested in in how will the course be
504.18,4.5,graded here's what we're going to do in
506.819,4.44,order to pass this course you have to
508.68,4.2,show a minimum competence in the exams
511.259,4.02,any student that doesn't have a weighted
512.88,3.959,average of 30 or greater from the
515.279,3.18,midterm and final will not pass no
516.839,3.481,matter how wonderful your homeworks and
518.459,3.601,projects and quizzes are you must show
520.32,3.06,that you understand the material oil in
522.06,3.06,a proctored exam where you are
523.38,3.24,independently thinking and working so
525.12,2.219,we're going to have an exam minimum to
526.62,2.76,pass
527.339,4.381,and then the activities in the course
529.38,4.92,which will account for the percentage of
531.72,4.5,the grade are homeworks quizzes projects
534.3,4.14,the midterm and the final and you can
536.22,4.2,see that the exams together 50 and the
538.44,4.44,other things are 50 so it's about half
540.42,5.28,and half and then
542.88,5.519,from the numerical average uh grades the
545.7,4.56,students who meet the above requirements
548.399,3.841,will then be given a grade in the range
550.26,4.199,from a to F and it depends on as it says
552.24,4.5,there the classes overall average the
554.459,4.801,distribution your personal performance
556.74,4.5,uh your effort your attendance your
559.26,3.36,participation in the class so those can
561.24,3.06,be factors that affect your personal
562.62,3.3,grade
564.3,3.84,um yeah there's a bunch of resources
565.92,3.359,here like there was on the cs223 website
568.14,2.639,I won't go through them now because
569.279,2.941,they're not of any value you don't
570.779,3.301,really know why we need them and what
572.22,3.6,they're for but they'll be useful later
574.08,3.48,there's a policy statement about
575.82,4.32,homework there will be homework
577.56,3.839,assignments posted here as they become
580.14,2.52,active when you click the link something
581.399,3.781,will happen right now nothing happens
582.66,3.119,because the first homework's not posted
585.18,3.06,um
585.779,3.841,and solutions to previous homeworks will
588.24,3.0,be always placed in the library on
589.62,2.94,reserve soon after the homework is due
591.24,3.779,you can go and get the solutions and
592.56,4.5,check your work to see how well you did
595.019,4.141,project assignments will be based here
597.06,3.719,we generally have two projects the first
599.16,3.419,one is an Assembly Language programming
600.779,3.3,project the second one is a processor
602.579,4.021,design project so I'll be grouping you
604.079,4.021,up in groups of four or five and where
606.6,3.359,you'll be working together first on this
608.1,3.66,in teams then we'll reshuffle the
609.959,3.661,project teams and you'll form a new team
611.76,3.18,and you'll work with that one sort of
613.62,3.54,like in companies they form project
614.94,3.3,teams do a project then they reform and
617.16,2.16,they form a different team for a
618.24,3.48,different project
619.32,4.079,uh there's an exam policy statement here
621.72,3.84,which says what you need to be aware of
623.399,4.38,when you come to our exams in the
625.56,5.58,previous year's exams are generally
627.779,4.861,posted but then we take them down and
631.14,3.18,they're not posted so but you can I'm
632.64,3.18,sure find them anyway if you look so
634.32,3.18,we'll put up just before the midterm
635.82,3.72,we'll put up the last two years midterm
637.5,3.779,exams as samples to see what kind of
639.54,3.6,questions to expect and then just before
641.279,4.021,the final we'll put up the last two
643.14,4.379,years final exams to give you an idea of
645.3,4.92,what to expect and then as we did in
647.519,4.38,cs223 the grades for homeworks quizzes
650.22,5.1,projects and exams will be posted on
651.899,6.361,links here uh probably by section
655.32,5.28,and then at the end the lecture slides
658.26,3.3,so the lecture slides will be posted
660.6,3.479,here
661.56,4.5,all right are there any questions about
664.079,2.88,the sort of administrative aspect of the
666.06,2.88,course
666.959,3.721,um anything that you want to ask about
668.94,4.2,how we're going to be running the course
670.68,3.719,not the content but the administration
673.14,6.56,of the course
674.399,5.301,policies and I don't know procedures
679.8,2.42,okay
683.339,3.18,if you don't have them now maybe they'll
684.959,3.721,come to your mind later and you can send
686.519,4.32,me an email as you know I try not to do
688.68,3.719,too much course Administration in the
690.839,3.18,class we want to focus on the material
692.399,3.481,of the learning of computer
694.019,3.481,organizations so I try to keep the admin
695.88,3.48,outside class time this is the biggest
697.5,3.48,section of time that we'll give to
699.36,3.9,Administration in the whole semester is
700.98,3.84,this little introduction here because I
703.26,3.36,think the class time should be spent on
704.82,3.9,content you can read the announcements
706.62,3.659,that's a lot of administration if you
708.72,3.72,have questions you can email me and I'll
710.279,4.86,respond we have a good group of Tas
712.44,4.32,including PhD students and some top
715.139,3.181,level Master students and people that
716.76,3.24,took this course before and very much
718.32,4.139,enjoyed it and they'll look forward to
720.0,3.779,you visiting them in their office and
722.459,2.94,you probably will want to do that when
723.779,2.521,the projects come because you'll need
725.399,4.401,their help
726.3,3.5,any any questions at all
730.139,4.921,okay and oh wait maybe yeah yeah almost
732.959,3.841,thing okay then then there aren't any
735.06,3.6,all right then let's start the material
736.8,4.32,let's begin chapter one and an overview
738.66,6.26,of computer organizations
741.12,3.8,everybody okay all right let's do that
760.5,4.2,okay
761.519,5.161,um I co-teached this course with um OS
764.7,3.48,John ostirk he teaches section number
766.68,2.82,one and number two and I'm teaching
768.18,3.54,section number three so it's a
769.5,3.959,well-coordinated course if for any
771.72,3.179,reason you need to transfer sections
773.459,4.201,you'll be getting excellent instruction
774.899,4.921,from Ocean in the other two sections if
777.66,4.5,for some reason you have to miss and you
779.82,3.78,want to get the material live uh you can
782.16,3.06,go to the other section and get it but
783.6,3.179,there's also the material will be on the
785.22,3.6,videotapes which you'll be able to see
786.779,4.381,and also the slides are posted on the
788.82,4.98,web so there's lots of opportunities
791.16,3.9,um for you to get it if you miss it okay
793.8,2.52,I don't encourage you to miss I
795.06,3.0,encourage you to come to class all the
796.32,3.42,time but in case you missed the class
798.06,3.719,there's opportunities to see the lecture
799.74,4.56,or get the material or even get it live
801.779,4.74,in the other section we go first and
804.3,3.9,then the other two sections meet next
806.519,3.12,week so this if you missed today for
808.2,2.939,example simple you could come later
809.639,3.061,you'll have that advantage throughout
811.139,3.0,the whole semester your section is just
812.7,3.24,a little ahead of the other two sections
814.139,4.621,so if you miss then you can go to the
815.94,5.959,other sections and and hear that same
818.76,3.139,material being taught
823.16,5.979,okay here's a imposing slide of the
827.16,4.14,course Contents I think this is actually
829.139,4.26,just taken out of the catalog the
831.3,4.62,catalog kind of what is a student
833.399,4.261,expected to learn if they get into cs224
835.92,3.359,and you can see we're going to have an
837.66,2.82,overview and then we're going to talk
839.279,3.961,about something real important called
840.48,3.9,instruction set architecture Isa and
843.24,2.76,we'll spend quite a lot of time maybe
844.38,3.3,two three weeks on instruction set
846.0,3.6,architecture here the word architecture
847.68,3.599,sounds like Hardware here the word
849.6,3.179,instruction sounds like software and
851.279,3.24,that's exactly it the hardware and the
852.779,4.381,software coming together at this level
854.519,4.5,we'll look up designing an instruction
857.16,4.2,set architecture which essentially means
859.019,4.981,designing a processor we'll look at two
861.36,4.32,basic uh families of architectural
864.0,3.24,approaches complex instruction set
865.68,3.54,computers and reduced instruction set
867.24,3.899,computers then we'll work down on the
869.22,4.38,Assembly Language level and we'll do a
871.139,4.2,lot of work at low level software and
873.6,3.599,then how to translate those and how to
875.339,3.781,startup programs even including
877.199,3.781,compilation so we'll look a quick look
879.12,3.959,at compilers then we'll move into
880.98,4.2,arithmetic and how you do arithmetic in
883.079,4.44,the computer so we'll look at computer
885.18,3.839,arithmetic what units are needed in
887.519,4.021,order to do the computer arithmetic
889.019,4.5,including floating Point numbers and
891.54,3.84,their implementations so after we've
893.519,3.541,gotten the arithmetic then we'll head
895.38,3.84,into the full processor design so this
897.06,3.719,is for the ALU you know arithmetic logic
899.22,4.2,unit once we got that then we'll put it
900.779,4.86,together in a full processor design and
903.42,4.68,having already surveyed what kind of
905.639,5.041,design considerations and the options
908.1,4.679,then we'll actually design a processor
910.68,4.44,we'll design the data path we'll design
912.779,4.381,the control we'll Implement them then
915.12,4.7,we'll pipeline it and speed it up we'll
917.16,6.119,look at difficulties called hazards and
919.82,5.259,issues with pipeline design and then we
923.279,3.901,will even look at how to predict
925.079,3.961,branches in order to get further
927.18,3.24,performance Improvement and how to
929.04,3.539,handle exceptions which are all
930.42,3.599,sometimes called interrupts then after
932.579,3.841,we've done all that you can see that's
934.019,3.901,about 70 of the course then we're going
936.42,3.18,to work on the other parts of a
937.92,4.02,computer's architecture which are memory
939.6,4.26,and input output so then we'll spend
941.94,4.139,time on the memory hierarchy principles
943.86,3.719,and structures of memory uh performance
946.079,3.18,dealing with caching dealing with
947.579,3.841,virtual memory dealing with segmented
949.259,3.661,memory dealing with paging some of those
951.42,3.719,topics actually are very important in
952.92,5.099,operating system design so that's why we
955.139,4.861,require cs224 before taking the
958.019,3.661,operating systems course so you'll get a
960.0,3.24,good understanding of computer memory
961.68,4.579,but not obviously as deep as computer
963.24,6.32,processors then we move lastly into
966.259,6.041,input output devices performance
969.56,5.8,interfacing buses and things like that
972.3,5.279,so how to connect peripherals to the
975.36,3.06,computer and then lastly in the final
977.579,2.401,week we'll be looking at
978.42,3.8,multi-processors and multi-computers
979.98,5.52,including clusters and multi-chip
982.22,5.14,multi-core processors
985.5,4.259,all right so
987.36,4.38,basically you know everything's on the
989.759,4.14,website go there and look your questions
991.74,4.56,are answered here's the layout of the
993.899,4.56,distribution of the of the points to
996.3,4.2,pass you have to make two exams exam
998.459,3.361,grades have to be above the minimum and
1000.5,4.259,you have to have overall course
1001.82,6.24,performance that's passing
1004.759,6.961,all right that's um
1008.06,5.399,let's begin now uh with the question
1011.72,2.84,um you know what do we mean by a
1013.459,3.12,computer
1014.56,3.339,there's different types of computers
1016.579,3.781,different uses of computers different
1017.899,3.901,manufacturers so it's a pretty broad
1020.36,3.78,category when we talk about computer
1021.8,4.08,don't just think oh I know what a
1024.14,4.38,computer is it's this thing right here
1025.88,4.679,you know a desktop or a laptop because
1028.52,4.2,that's too narrow of a definition yes
1030.559,5.941,you know what one particular kind of
1032.72,6.479,computer is but we have desktops laptops
1036.5,5.22,servers embedded devices which are
1039.199,5.581,computers lots and lots of different
1041.72,4.56,kinds of each of these we have different
1044.78,3.74,uses of computers you realize there's
1046.28,5.46,computers in automobiles computers in
1048.52,6.039,portable electronic devices computers in
1051.74,4.74,uh lots of things different
1054.559,4.801,manufacturers know they're not all made
1056.48,4.319,by Intel or just AMD and different
1059.36,3.6,underlying Technologies and different
1060.799,3.781,costs it's a really broad category and
1062.96,3.54,our goal in this course is to expand
1064.58,4.08,your understanding of computing and
1066.5,3.539,computers much bigger than perhaps you
1068.66,2.82,have thought it's not just the thing
1070.039,3.481,that you can put in your chanta and take
1071.48,4.98,with you to school and you know read on
1073.52,5.88,an airplane or a bus the best way to
1076.46,4.74,learn about computers is to focus on a
1079.4,3.6,specific instance and learn how it works
1081.2,4.02,at the same time while teaching general
1083.0,4.32,principles so you have both a specific
1085.22,3.6,and deep example and you also have a
1087.32,2.94,broad set of understanding to apply
1088.82,3.96,through a computer so what we're going
1090.26,4.2,to do is learn general principles and
1092.78,4.019,historical perspectives about how
1094.46,4.2,computers have evolved as computer
1096.799,3.721,Architects and computer Engineers have
1098.66,3.66,brought them to the place we are at
1100.52,4.14,right now but at the same time we'll be
1102.32,5.34,looking at a specific instance of one
1104.66,4.86,computer architecture
1107.66,4.259,now why would you want to learn this
1109.52,4.08,stuff I don't really want to it's just
1111.919,3.061,because it's a required course I hate
1113.6,2.88,Hardware you know that may be your
1114.98,3.96,answer I hope I can persuade you to
1116.48,5.04,Vasquez from that some positive answers
1118.94,3.54,to that question are the following if
1121.52,2.159,you want to call yourself a computer
1122.48,3.24,engineer you have to understand
1123.679,3.541,computers right if you're a bridge
1125.72,2.64,engineer you understand Bridges if
1127.22,2.88,you're a traffic engineer you understand
1128.36,3.42,traffic you're a chemical engineer you
1130.1,2.699,understand chemistry so if you're a
1131.78,3.72,computer engineer you must understand
1132.799,5.461,the computer deeply widely completely
1135.5,4.74,and well second thing is you want to
1138.26,4.26,build software that people can really
1140.24,4.679,use and if it has terrible performance
1142.52,4.32,then it won't be used and so your
1144.919,4.681,software will not be a valued in order
1146.84,4.38,to satisfy customers needs there must be
1149.6,3.3,adequate performance people are
1151.22,3.839,impatient and they push the button they
1152.9,3.72,want to see some response so if you
1155.059,4.201,don't understand the relation between
1156.62,5.4,software and Hardware your performance
1159.26,5.58,will be probably poor and then the third
1162.02,4.86,thing is and this happens a lot computer
1164.84,4.199,Engineers are often called upon to give
1166.88,3.78,advice or even make a purchasing
1169.039,3.361,decision should we buy this Hardware or
1170.66,3.66,should we buy this Hardware how much
1172.4,3.84,money is it worth to spend to get that
1174.32,3.9,we have this budget what's the best
1176.24,3.24,performance we can get to meet our needs
1178.22,2.88,for that so you have to understand
1179.48,3.78,Hardware because you're involved in
1181.1,4.56,purchasing it either advising or
1183.26,4.62,actually making the decision yourself
1185.66,4.68,um now both hardware and software are
1187.88,4.08,going to affect our performance when a
1190.34,4.56,program runs on a computer of course the
1191.96,4.62,software's algorithm and it's Big O and
1194.9,3.18,the efficiency of the code and the
1196.58,3.599,compilation those will have an effect on
1198.08,3.719,it but so will the hardware I've listed
1200.179,3.661,here a number of factors that determine
1201.799,3.541,the performance first is the algorithm
1203.84,3.9,and it actually affects the number of
1205.34,4.98,source level statements and then the
1207.74,5.1,language and compiler and architecture
1210.32,3.96,together determine from The Source how
1212.84,3.18,many machine instructions will be
1214.28,3.84,executed notice you don't write machine
1216.02,4.019,instructions so there's already been a
1218.12,3.9,transformation from Source level down to
1220.039,4.321,Machine level Source being things like C
1222.02,4.32,plus plus and Java high level languages
1224.36,3.72,and then the processor in memory will
1226.34,4.8,determine how fast each individual
1228.08,4.92,instruction is executed and the i o and
1231.14,3.419,the number of cores will determine the
1233.0,3.24,overall system performance so we've
1234.559,3.961,actually got one two three four
1236.24,4.98,different factors in system performance
1238.52,4.56,and I think you can see that it's like a
1241.22,3.66,chain if any one of these is the weakest
1243.08,4.5,link that will limit the performance if
1244.88,4.74,you have a bad algorithm with a bad Big
1247.58,4.32,O then you're not going to be able to
1249.62,3.78,say save it even if you have the world's
1251.9,3.24,fastest Hardware on the other hand if
1253.4,3.6,you have the world's greatest algorithm
1255.14,3.539,but you've got problems here or here or
1257.0,3.24,here you'll slow it down and you'll
1258.679,5.041,waste the performance of the algorithm
1260.24,5.66,so optimizing compilers efficient
1263.72,4.8,algorithms high performance
1265.9,4.42,implementation and architectures and
1268.52,3.539,multi-cores are all ways to make things
1270.32,3.239,go faster and of course we'll be looking
1272.059,3.86,at this this and this in this course
1273.559,5.941,this is other courses you get that in
1275.919,5.5,algorithms and your software engineering
1279.5,4.44,and programming courses
1281.419,5.88,all right now the five components of a
1283.94,5.84,computer is classically understood are
1287.299,5.461,the processor which contains both
1289.78,6.279,control and data path so you see that
1292.76,5.159,those two here the memory and the input
1296.059,5.281,and the output so sometimes it's reduced
1297.919,5.341,to three processor memory Io Io actually
1301.34,4.319,means both of these processor of course
1303.26,4.14,means both of these and we've got the
1305.659,3.841,control which is giving the orders
1307.4,4.139,that's the brain we've got the data path
1309.5,4.559,here shown as a kind of a production
1311.539,3.901,line you know taking care of data and
1314.059,2.841,actually doing things with the data so
1315.44,3.599,there's like the body
1316.9,3.94,notice that memories in the middle
1319.039,4.561,things from the processor that have to
1320.84,4.86,go to IO go through memory memory feeds
1323.6,4.98,or receives from the processor and it
1325.7,4.5,also feeds and receives from i o input
1328.58,3.78,as things coming in output is obviously
1330.2,4.38,things going on these little boxes are
1332.36,4.08,data okay and you can see that they have
1334.58,3.839,all different shapes and sizes for Io
1336.44,3.66,but they're much more regular when
1338.419,3.721,they're inside the processor they're
1340.1,4.62,they're the right size for processor to
1342.14,5.94,be able to handle and so here's a good
1344.72,6.959,equation data path plus control is the
1348.08,5.88,processor processor sometimes called CPU
1351.679,4.38,Central Processing Unit that's an old
1353.96,4.56,term from my days but you still hear
1356.059,4.801,people saying CPU but these days a more
1358.52,3.96,modern word would be processor
1360.86,3.48,are there any questions about this this
1362.48,3.6,is probably one of the more important
1364.34,4.62,slides that we'll see this semester
1366.08,3.839,because it gives the picture of what is
1368.96,4.26,a computer
1369.919,4.981,it's a collection of the processor which
1373.22,4.56,itself is a collection of two major
1374.9,4.8,units memory and input output
1377.78,4.62,it actually shows a kind of a functional
1379.7,4.2,model of what it might do five classical
1382.4,2.46,components
1383.9,3.659,um
1384.86,4.92,input devices are things like mouse and
1387.559,3.781,keyboard but many other as well output
1389.78,3.779,devices are things like displays and
1391.34,5.28,printers but many more as well memory
1393.559,6.6,are things like the jump drive that I
1396.62,6.299,plugged in here disk drives dram static
1400.159,5.221,Ram CDs all kinds of things can be used
1402.919,3.901,for storage networks are some of the
1405.38,4.26,components connected to computers and
1406.82,4.68,our primary focus in this course as I
1409.64,3.72,said earlier is going to be the
1411.5,3.6,processor unit itself that's going to be
1413.36,5.04,our primary focus we'll have a secondary
1415.1,4.86,focus on memory and IO but those are
1418.4,3.54,only the final 30 percent of the course
1419.96,4.02,we really want to understand deeply the
1421.94,4.739,processor because it's the you might say
1423.98,4.98,this the the actor inside the computer
1426.679,4.441,it's implemented using billions of
1428.96,3.66,transistors as you know and so it's
1431.12,3.36,impossible to understand it by looking
1432.62,3.48,at a low level so we're going to do the
1434.48,3.66,classic engineering thing we're going to
1436.1,3.9,use abstraction we're going to take a
1438.14,3.779,higher level view if that's not high
1440.0,4.32,enough we'll go to a higher level view
1441.919,3.781,we'll choose the view level in order to
1444.32,3.839,get the right trade-off between
1445.7,4.74,understanding and detail too much detail
1448.159,4.62,blurs our understanding not enough
1450.44,4.14,detail also limits our understanding so
1452.779,3.301,the great thing about abstraction is a
1454.58,3.959,modeling approach that allows you to
1456.08,4.8,look at and understand the level that's
1458.539,5.821,appropriate for your needs so
1460.88,5.76,abstraction omits unnecessary detail and
1464.36,3.86,helps us cope with complexity it's a
1466.64,4.56,very key engineering
1468.22,6.699,approach or engineering tool to abstract
1471.2,4.38,and therefore model at the right level
1474.919,2.581,um
1475.58,3.42,so there's a lot of abstractions in
1477.5,2.94,understanding a computer and this course
1479.0,3.08,is going to deal with quite a few of
1480.44,4.739,them okay let's just toss out some
1482.08,4.959,application Software System software
1485.179,4.441,Assembly Language software machine
1487.039,4.62,language programs architectural issues
1489.62,3.72,sequential logic and finance State
1491.659,3.841,machines combinational logic and
1493.34,4.68,arithmetic circuits Boolean logic down
1495.5,4.38,to the bit level transistors use to
1498.02,3.42,build the logic gates semiconductor and
1499.88,4.02,silicon used to build the transistors
1501.44,5.0,properties of atoms and electrons and
1503.9,4.62,Quantum Dynamics to make the
1506.44,3.46,semiconductor work okay so did you see
1508.52,3.72,what there there's a nice stack of
1509.9,4.259,abstraction and every layer is a way
1512.24,3.24,that you could look and say I want to
1514.159,3.301,understand computers I'm going to look
1515.48,3.78,at Quantum Dynamics and atoms oh my
1517.46,3.12,goodness or I want to understand
1519.26,3.18,computers I'm going to look at a few
1520.58,3.12,billion transistors or I want to
1522.44,4.14,understand computers I want to just look
1523.7,6.18,at the application software level huh
1526.58,6.12,it's a spreadsheet oh computers work
1529.88,4.62,with numbers computers let me enter my
1532.7,5.4,words and write my letters that's a very
1534.5,5.46,high level abstraction it hides all this
1538.1,3.66,we've been as you know working here at
1539.96,5.28,the level of sequential logic and
1541.76,5.34,combinational logic in cs223 and this of
1545.24,3.539,course the subset of that now we're
1547.1,4.679,going to start to move up to some of
1548.779,6.301,these levels here and here and here okay
1551.779,5.76,so I say our course kind of deals in
1555.08,5.099,this range right here so I'm overlap
1557.539,4.02,with 223 and some new stuff for 224.
1560.179,3.6,you've got plenty of courses that work
1561.559,4.5,at this level and moving down below here
1563.779,3.721,transistors semiconductors we're moving
1566.059,3.841,toward electrical engineering and
1567.5,3.9,physics okay so that that will be their
1569.9,3.96,domain to model at that level so we're
1571.4,4.44,in the middle of this stack with
1573.86,4.02,software engineering here
1575.84,4.02,Computer Engineering especially the
1577.88,3.96,hardware and and computer architecture
1579.86,4.439,here and then moving into the but this
1581.84,6.38,is a set of abstract layers each is an
1584.299,3.921,abstraction built upon the one below
1588.919,4.14,all right now let's make it into a
1591.26,4.08,diagram form that was a stack of words
1593.059,4.561,this is a stack of blocks in a block
1595.34,3.12,diagram same thing though
1597.62,3.36,um
1598.46,3.66,application programs sit on top of an
1600.98,2.52,operating system they need that
1602.12,4.5,operating system to operate the
1603.5,5.34,operating system needs the compiler and
1606.62,5.52,the firmware which are again software
1608.84,5.219,okay now below the this Blue Block in
1612.14,3.44,the middle is the implementation in
1614.059,4.74,hardware and you can see that I've got
1615.58,5.74,an instruction set processor I've got an
1618.799,4.081,i o subsystem to supporting that with
1621.32,2.88,logic design supporting that with
1622.88,3.72,circuit design supporting that was
1624.2,5.28,layout so once you know what you want
1626.6,5.04,you can implement it going this way and
1629.48,5.34,this right here instruction set
1631.64,5.58,architecture that blue box is the top of
1634.82,3.9,what we call computer architecture so
1637.22,3.86,computer architecture is both the
1638.72,6.0,implementation of the hardware
1641.08,5.74,and the model of what it will do the
1644.72,4.439,architecture I mean this building has an
1646.82,4.26,architecture and it also has an
1649.159,3.661,implementation the architect designed it
1651.08,3.12,and then after that the building company
1652.82,3.12,came and built it
1654.2,3.66,but they didn't just build it randomly
1655.94,3.119,they built according to a design so that
1657.86,3.059,the building would have what the
1659.059,4.141,functionality which is needed to support
1660.919,4.14,instruction and labs and administration
1663.2,5.94,and offices and so on
1665.059,5.161,security Etc in the same way this blue
1669.14,4.62,layer
1670.22,6.179,is the key it's the middle of the this
1673.76,4.86,software depends upon a reliable
1676.399,4.14,interface here for the instruction set
1678.62,4.38,architecture the instructions that
1680.539,4.14,architecture once designed determines
1683.0,3.12,how you will Implement so actually this
1684.679,3.24,is going to be a key Focus for our
1686.12,4.799,courses this middle layer or the
1687.919,4.98,software touches the hardware
1690.919,5.581,that's the reason for the choosing this
1692.899,5.4,textbook the software Hardware interface
1696.5,2.88,here's a picture of it in a different
1698.299,3.901,way
1699.38,4.5,these two guys are acting or dancing or
1702.2,4.62,sword fighting or whatever they're doing
1703.88,4.74,and they're on a stage the stage is the
1706.82,4.32,platform and it's called the instruction
1708.62,4.38,set you cannot have software if you
1711.14,3.84,don't have an instruction set because
1713.0,3.12,the set means we will choose this
1714.98,2.819,instruction and then we'll follow it
1716.12,3.779,with this one then we'll follow it with
1717.799,3.901,this one and so you build a program by
1719.899,3.541,choosing instructions you put the
1721.7,3.839,instructions together in an order which
1723.44,3.42,implements the algorithm that you want
1725.539,3.901,to have in your program so an
1726.86,4.74,instruction set is the resources from
1729.44,4.2,which we will choose the instructions
1731.6,3.42,that in are needed for your program or
1733.64,4.919,your program or your program or my
1735.02,5.759,program so it's the resource so the
1738.559,4.321,instruction set is the model of the
1740.779,4.081,computer oh it has a branch oh it has an
1742.88,5.159,ad oh it has a shift I can build
1744.86,6.24,programs so the software needs to have
1748.039,5.221,this much of a view what are is my
1751.1,4.98,instruction set but the instruction set
1753.26,5.039,of course is implemented by a Hercules
1756.08,4.26,which is our Hardware this is the
1758.299,4.921,implementation of it once you have an
1760.34,4.38,instruction set that determines the
1763.22,4.02,hardware you must have in order to
1764.72,4.5,supply those instructions if you build
1767.24,4.14,hardware and doesn't have a shift then
1769.22,4.38,it's not part of your instruction set so
1771.38,4.799,understand once again this is the key
1773.6,4.559,layer the software understands it as a
1776.179,3.961,model depends on it and runs on it but
1778.159,4.02,it's implemented by Hardware so together
1780.14,3.659,this is our computer architecture this
1782.179,3.661,plus this
1783.799,3.181,are there any questions about this
1785.84,2.88,concept here
1786.98,4.199,okay trying to get the idea different
1788.72,3.959,ways you know pictures block diagram
1791.179,3.181,words
1792.679,3.061,key abstraction is the instruction set
1794.36,3.78,architecture
1795.74,4.86,okay now here's a verbal definition of
1798.14,4.68,it let's see if we can work with this
1800.6,4.079,now and some people are multi-mode
1802.82,3.9,Learners others have different modes
1804.679,4.021,this is a verbal way now to try to
1806.72,4.38,approach the concept
1808.7,3.959,the ISA instruction set architecture
1811.1,2.88,sometimes just called the architecture
1812.659,3.961,because we're not talking about bridges
1813.98,3.48,or Highway systems or you know buildings
1816.62,3.779,we're talking about computer
1817.46,5.579,architecture the ISA or the architecture
1820.399,4.38,is the abstract interface that's the key
1823.039,3.661,it's an interface between what the
1824.779,5.341,hardware and the lowest level of
1826.7,5.88,software that encompasses all the
1830.12,5.159,information necessary to write a machine
1832.58,4.5,language program including the registers
1835.279,4.321,the instructions the memory the i o and
1837.08,5.4,everything it is the interface on which
1839.6,4.92,the lowest level software can run and it
1842.48,5.64,provides all that that software needs to
1844.52,6.3,know so it enables various
1848.12,4.62,implementations which have cost and
1850.82,3.3,performance differences to run the same
1852.74,4.559,software
1854.12,4.919,now that means that if you specify the
1857.299,4.38,instruction set architecture
1859.039,4.441,the same software can run on it even if
1861.679,3.36,you implement it that way or you
1863.48,4.14,implement it that way
1865.039,5.161,now what's the classic example of a
1867.62,4.08,common Isa implemented in two very
1870.2,3.06,different ways
1871.7,4.079,that all of us are familiar with every
1873.26,5.12,time you touch a computer you have an
1875.779,2.601,example of this
1879.679,5.24,the programs run no matter whether you
1882.14,2.779,buy it from
1885.5,6.98,manufacturer X or manufacturer y
1889.519,2.961,what are we talking about
1894.26,4.139,if I open up this computer what will I
1896.6,4.64,find inside for a processor
1898.399,2.841,what will I find inside
1901.94,4.56,will I find Intel inside
1904.279,3.921,maybe but maybe not
1906.5,5.64,what else might I find inside
1908.2,5.859,AMD now do I need to ask the computer oh
1912.14,4.32,this is an Intel processor okay I got to
1914.059,3.661,use these programs oh no it's AMD those
1916.46,2.459,won't work I got to use these programs
1917.72,3.179,is that a problem
1918.919,4.26,no why not
1920.899,4.5,because there's a common instruction set
1923.179,4.5,architecture
1925.399,4.921,which the programs run on but the two
1927.679,4.921,companies have implemented their
1930.32,3.9,processors in different ways
1932.6,3.84,exactly what it says here it enables
1934.22,4.14,implementations of varying costs have
1936.44,3.359,you been to buy a processor lately in
1938.36,3.48,those prices am these prices are
1939.799,3.48,different varying performance been to a
1941.84,2.88,website lately and seen performance
1943.279,2.76,claims and performance measurements
1944.72,2.699,they're not the same they're not
1946.039,2.461,identical
1947.419,3.181,they have different number of
1948.5,3.299,transistors and different layouts and
1950.6,3.299,different everything internal
1951.799,4.86,organizations but when it comes to
1953.899,4.741,dancing on the stage the stage is the
1956.659,4.681,same your software runs no matter
1958.64,4.98,whether it's one or the other okay now
1961.34,3.66,that takes us right back to this one
1963.62,5.46,here
1965.0,6.779,take out this and put in a different one
1969.08,5.4,as long as it does this we don't care
1971.779,4.441,that's a really key concept
1974.48,3.96,you can Implement in a different way
1976.22,4.26,let's go back another slide
1978.44,4.32,back to this one okay again the
1980.48,4.439,architecture
1982.76,5.46,boundary with the software is here so if
1984.919,4.74,I change all this but this still knew
1988.22,4.14,this still implements the same
1989.659,3.661,architecture no problem everything's
1992.36,2.819,fine
1993.32,4.14,that's
1995.179,4.561,actually quite significant isn't it
1997.46,4.199,what does it mean for a company like
1999.74,4.02,Intel
2001.659,5.101,what's the consequence of that
2003.76,3.0,significant
2008.32,4.339,statement that we just made what's the
2009.88,2.779,consequence for a company
2020.08,6.18,okay let me ask it again your Intel and
2023.98,3.72,you know that out there there's six
2026.26,4.86,billion human beings that are running
2027.7,5.219,you know their code on your architecture
2031.12,3.059,does that mean that you can never change
2032.919,2.521,your chips for the rest of your
2034.179,3.061,company's life
2035.44,5.239,nothing can change
2037.24,3.439,doesn't mean that what does it mean
2044.5,3.12,it sounds like it means we can't have
2046.36,3.36,innovation
2047.62,3.6,is that true of course not Intel is a
2049.72,4.699,very Innovative company so how does
2051.22,3.199,Intel manage to innovate
2055.24,3.0,yes
2061.919,6.281,right right exactly they can make this
2065.139,4.921,faster cheaper lower power than after a
2068.2,3.24,while started adding multiple cores Etc
2070.06,3.0,et cetera the other thing that they've
2071.44,3.179,done all companies do this they say look
2073.06,3.42,we're keeping this the same but we're
2074.619,5.841,going to add a little more and they they
2076.48,7.34,extend it but they don't change the core
2080.46,6.879,if they did software would stop running
2083.82,5.38,oh no it doesn't work what the new Chips
2087.339,4.441,don't run the code I've been using this
2089.2,4.86,code for eight years I love my games I
2091.78,4.74,love my Graphics I love my office set it
2094.06,3.72,means it doesn't work uh no sorry it
2096.52,3.12,doesn't work you have to get another
2097.78,3.36,version of the software no thank you I
2099.64,3.84,won't buy chips if they force me to
2101.14,5.64,change all my software I don't want to
2103.48,5.46,have to have a processor change Force an
2106.78,3.24,entire software change too at least if I
2108.94,3.179,can avoid it that would be very
2110.02,3.839,disruptive to my organization to my
2112.119,4.621,company I think if you're a bank they
2113.859,4.26,say we've got a great new server it'll
2116.74,2.82,be awesome you'll get much better
2118.119,2.821,performance and your customers will love
2119.56,4.08,it it's secure and it can't be hacked
2120.94,4.919,into great how much does it cost what's
2123.64,3.719,this performance wonderful oh just
2125.859,3.181,there's one problem none of your current
2127.359,3.541,software will run on it you'll have to
2129.04,3.96,rewrite all your programs uh no thanks
2130.9,3.48,I'll find somebody their vendor see this
2133.0,3.66,this idea about instruction set
2134.38,4.68,architecture is very very important we
2136.66,5.52,don't want to make existing software
2139.06,5.4,obsolete that would be a horrible thing
2142.18,5.28,yes
2144.46,3.0,architectures
2149.14,5.04,um is it like confliction between
2152.14,4.28,their instructions that architecture is
2154.18,2.24,different
2157.18,5.72,yeah there's been a there's been a
2159.16,3.74,inevitable pressure on
2163.24,3.78,yeah okay that's exactly the issue that
2165.88,2.88,we're talking about it's not pleasant it
2167.02,3.42,is it's not nice to have to say oh my
2168.76,4.74,old programs don't work on this new
2170.44,6.419,architecture very difficult choice to
2173.5,5.94,say sorry guys we're taking not this
2176.859,4.74,away we're taking this away and you
2179.44,4.02,can't dance anymore because the new one
2181.599,3.721,isn't going to work you have to learn a
2183.46,4.379,different dance that's not very nice
2185.32,4.68,yeah companies that do that take big
2187.839,4.201,business risk and they can sometimes
2190.0,4.92,lose customers as a consequence of it um
2192.04,5.88,yeah the only thing you can do in that
2194.92,5.04,case is make the upgrade painless or as
2197.92,3.96,little painful as possible
2199.96,3.36,um otherwise people say that's it I'm
2201.88,3.06,not dealing with them and go over here
2203.32,3.66,or not or not upgrade or whatever
2204.94,3.6,there's there's a number of factors
2206.98,3.54,we'll talk about in this course
2208.54,6.78,um about that all right let's move on
2210.52,6.9,now the combination of that Isa the
2215.32,4.62,basic instruction set and the operating
2217.42,4.679,system interface together is called the
2219.94,4.5,application binary interface so right
2222.099,4.681,where the operating system has a binary
2224.44,5.04,interface to the ISA we call that the
2226.78,4.44,ABI and that's the user portion of the
2229.48,4.32,instruction set plus the operating
2231.22,4.8,system interfaces that are used by
2233.8,4.44,application programmers and it defines a
2236.02,4.5,standard binary portable across all
2238.24,4.379,computers in other words the ISA plus
2240.52,4.26,the operating systems support that is
2242.619,4.561,used by application programs if you
2244.78,3.72,piece them together now that can be
2247.18,3.06,portable and programs can be portable
2248.5,3.9,across all systems notice it's not just
2250.24,3.72,the hardware because programs are
2252.4,3.12,calling on they're running on the
2253.96,3.6,hardware but they're also calling
2255.52,5.04,operating system low-level functions for
2257.56,5.7,support and together that pair is the
2260.56,4.2,ABI application binary interface
2263.26,4.92,all right now
2264.76,4.68,back in 64 which is now what 45 years
2268.18,4.62,ago
2269.44,5.88,um three greats amdahl Blau and Brooks
2272.8,5.46,also famous each in their own right said
2275.32,5.4,the attributes of a Computing system as
2278.26,3.96,seen by the programmer notice the
2280.72,4.08,programmers looking hey look at this
2282.22,4.68,floor I'm I'm walking on
2284.8,4.44,um are the instruction set architecture
2286.9,5.699,what are those attributes well it's the
2289.24,5.04,structure and the functional behavior of
2292.599,3.661,the computer as distinct from the
2294.28,4.26,organization of how the data flows and
2296.26,4.2,how it's controlled The Logical design
2298.54,3.84,and the physical implementation distinct
2300.46,4.379,from different not that in other words
2302.38,4.68,the high level conceptual structure and
2304.839,4.201,functional Behavior not the
2307.06,5.16,implementation this says organization
2309.04,5.579,it's not that as distinct from any
2312.22,4.08,different from so back in 45 years ago
2314.619,4.74,they realized that the instruction set
2316.3,5.88,architecture is as the programmer sees
2319.359,5.76,the computer not as the designer sees
2322.18,5.52,the details okay so the ISA is going to
2325.119,4.921,include these things as a programmer at
2327.7,4.26,the low level you need to know
2330.04,3.84,how much storage have I got how is it
2331.96,3.72,organized what data types are provided
2333.88,3.9,for by this machine
2335.68,4.62,um how do I encode and represent
2337.78,4.5,instructions uh what is the instruction
2340.3,3.48,set what are the op codes that I can
2342.28,2.819,choose from you mean you do have shift I
2343.78,3.12,mean you do have floating Point
2345.099,4.02,operations great you mean you don't have
2346.9,3.78,you know whatever and there will be some
2349.119,4.621,and there's some that you didn't choose
2350.68,5.46,to include how do I address the items
2353.74,4.92,um or the instructions and and and uh
2356.14,4.26,what exception handling is visible to
2358.66,4.14,the program exception handling is when
2360.4,4.86,there's an error or an interrupt or a
2362.8,4.14,problem some of that's invisible but the
2365.26,3.96,part that's visible to the programmer
2366.94,4.74,also can everything is of this list
2369.22,5.04,that's visible to the programmer is
2371.68,4.64,called our Isa all right
2374.26,2.06,um
2377.22,4.84,now again Maura yesterday
2380.079,3.901,it's pretty important you can tell
2382.06,4.32,because I'm staying on it the
2383.98,4.44,instruction set architecture is a is a
2386.38,5.58,crucial maybe the most important
2388.42,6.24,abstraction between the hardware and the
2391.96,5.48,lowest level of software and the reason
2394.66,6.48,it's so important is it standardizes
2397.44,5.98,the interfaces the machine language bit
2401.14,4.439,patterns it suddenly defines the
2403.42,5.04,computer without telling all the details
2405.579,4.921,below it it tells the software here's
2408.46,5.1,what you have here's what you need to do
2410.5,4.859,and B to run on this computer the
2413.56,4.44,advantage is you can have different
2415.359,5.701,implementations of the same architecture
2418.0,5.28,Intel then and Intel now you know you
2421.06,3.539,can upgrade and also Intel versus AMD
2423.28,3.059,you know once you have an architecture
2424.599,3.48,and that's not the only example but
2426.339,3.24,that's the obvious one that we all know
2428.079,3.121,about once you have an architecture you
2429.579,4.321,can have different implementations of it
2431.2,5.7,the disadvantage is and it was raised
2433.9,6.0,here or is that your name yeah we raised
2436.9,4.82,it that sometimes it can prevent new
2439.9,4.439,Innovations because you're staying
2441.72,4.48,conservative to your code base and you
2444.339,3.901,don't want to leave anybody behind and
2446.2,5.28,so it can prevent innovation in some
2448.24,4.74,ways unless you change the ISA and some
2451.48,4.52,common instruction set architectures
2452.98,6.54,isas are as you will know
2456.0,5.2,ia32 and now IA 64 Intel architecture 32
2459.52,3.78,that's the one AMD and other
2461.2,4.8,manufacturers have to follow if they
2463.3,6.0,want to be running that code powerpc
2466.0,5.16,architecture mips architecture spark arm
2469.3,3.779,and many others is there only one
2471.16,4.32,company making this is there only one
2473.079,4.5,company making this is there no multiple
2475.48,4.74,sources with different implementations
2477.579,3.661,they come compete with each other so
2480.22,3.06,that's the great thing about an
2481.24,4.68,architecture it just says here's the
2483.28,4.86,plan see how you can realize it here's
2485.92,3.96,the here's the platform you implement
2488.14,3.179,and some companies will have better
2489.88,2.4,designers and Implement better than
2491.319,3.0,others
2492.28,4.799,all right let's take a really simplified
2494.319,6.721,instruction set architecture okay
2497.079,6.54,this is the mips ISA very simplified for
2501.04,3.96,the computer programmer to understand it
2503.619,3.061,what does the computer programmer
2505.0,4.44,understand from this well I've got 32
2506.68,4.86,registers that I can put data in and
2509.44,4.139,keep in as temporary storage I've got a
2511.54,3.42,another one called program counter and a
2513.579,4.321,high and a low register so the grand
2514.96,6.42,total seems to be 35 registers
2517.9,5.52,I've got some instructions loads and
2521.38,3.78,stores those go to and from memory I've
2523.42,4.26,got some computational instructions add
2525.16,3.959,subtract multiply divide I got jumping
2527.68,3.12,and branching instructions I have some
2529.119,3.661,floating Point instructions for handling
2530.8,3.66,real numbers I have some memory
2532.78,3.66,management and some special instructions
2534.46,2.94,they have specifics but I don't want to
2536.44,4.02,show them to you right now so I've got
2537.4,5.939,these are my instructions these are my
2540.46,4.379,data storage resources other than main
2543.339,3.841,memory of course and then the
2544.839,4.801,instructions come in three formats so
2547.18,4.5,when I have a 32-bit instruction
2549.64,5.459,it's either the format where the op code
2551.68,5.22,is followed by one two three registers
2555.099,3.781,a source another source and a
2556.9,4.56,destination and then there's a shift
2558.88,5.4,amount and a function field or the op
2561.46,5.82,code is followed by two registers and a
2564.28,4.98,16-bit immediate field or the op code is
2567.28,4.62,followed by a very long jump Target
2569.26,4.559,Field okay so only three basic
2571.9,3.9,instruction formats
2573.819,4.441,six instruction categories with some
2575.8,5.34,members in each category and a view of
2578.26,6.599,the storage so you might say
2581.14,5.939,here's where the data can be and here's
2584.859,3.301,what I can do with the data in the
2587.079,3.901,instructions and here's what the
2588.16,4.38,instructions have to look like wow you
2590.98,3.18,just hold you you scared us with all
2592.54,3.299,those slides about Isa we thought it was
2594.16,4.98,going to be core kunch hey it's not too
2595.839,4.861,bad that's a simple Isa it's what the
2599.14,4.979,programmer needs to know at the low
2600.7,4.74,level to run machine instructions to run
2604.119,2.46,machine instructions I think you all
2605.44,2.76,know don't you that C plus plus
2606.579,3.601,instructions don't run on the computer
2608.2,3.419,Java instructions don't run on the
2610.18,3.12,computer there's some levels of
2611.619,3.181,translation to get down to the
2613.3,2.22,instructions which do run on the
2614.8,2.76,computer
2615.52,5.04,you know you know that I'm sure that in
2617.56,5.22,the cs101 you talked about that
2620.56,3.9,so
2622.78,3.6,I think that's a good place to take a
2624.46,3.78,break so why don't we have a little you
2626.38,4.02,know 10 minute break here in between the
2628.24,3.54,two lessons and enjoy you know some
2630.4,2.939,fresh air and a glass of water or a
2631.78,3.24,stroll or a candy bar and we'll come
2633.339,3.801,back in 10 minutes okay so we'll see you
2635.02,2.12,then
