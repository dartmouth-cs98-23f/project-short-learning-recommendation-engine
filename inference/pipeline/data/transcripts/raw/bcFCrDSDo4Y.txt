0.16,4.32,hello everyone thank you for joining us
2.72,3.679,for today for our live session on
4.48,4.32,predictive modeling through spatial
6.399,3.841,analysis and data science this session
8.8,4.719,is part of our national government
10.24,5.439,webinar series my name is noelle lochren
13.519,4.321,and i am a marketing specialist on
15.679,3.6,esri's national government industry
17.84,4.56,solutions team
19.279,5.521,and i would like to let you know that
22.4,5.199,today's session is being recorded all of

41.6,4.24,presentation we'll get to those one by
43.44,2.4,one
45.92,4.0,we will also be providing two polling
48.079,3.601,questions during today's session those
49.92,4.0,are interactive and you can click on the
51.68,5.12,answers on the screen so we will have
53.92,5.92,those pop up as we ask those questions
56.8,6.48,and from there i'd also like to
59.84,5.92,introduce our speakers to you so we have
63.28,4.32,three um experts from esri here with us
65.76,3.76,today we have kate hess she is a
67.6,4.32,solution engineer for the geospatial
69.52,4.4,authorities team here at esri we also
71.92,4.32,have rami who is a solution engineer
73.92,4.08,also for the geospatial authorities team
76.24,3.84,and linda peters who is our global
78.0,4.32,business development manager
80.08,3.92,here at esri so with that i'd like to
82.32,4.4,pass this over to linda and she can get
84.0,5.2,us started with the agenda thank you
86.72,4.88,thanks so much noelle and uh welcome
89.2,4.32,everybody really glad you're here uh i'm
91.6,3.839,gonna shut camera off for bandwidth
93.52,3.52,considerations but i'll come back to you
95.439,2.561,at the end when we get to the q a
97.04,4.0,portion
98.0,5.119,um i would like to go over with you
101.04,3.84,today's agenda
103.119,4.881,so we are here to talk about spatial
104.88,5.599,analysis and data science um there's
108.0,3.84,going to be a lot of good demonstrations
110.479,3.441,for you today but we're going to start
111.84,4.16,out with a little context on data
113.92,3.92,science and gis
116.0,4.159,and then i'll invite kate and romney to
117.84,4.16,show you those great examples
120.159,4.32,as no noelle mentioned we'll have a
122.0,4.159,couple of poll questions along the way
124.479,3.92,we're going to share a lot of resources
126.159,4.961,with you and at the end open it up for
128.399,4.801,questions so we hope you're ready for us
131.12,4.56,um let's start as
133.2,4.32,i always tend to with the arcgis system
135.68,4.48,because although we're here to talk
137.52,5.359,about spatial analysis and data science
140.16,5.2,it starts with the arcgis platform
142.879,4.801,many of you know that arcgis is a
145.36,3.92,comprehensive platform it's open it's
147.68,4.48,services based
149.28,4.239,it's distributable it's extendable and
152.16,4.4,it supports
153.519,5.681,large organizations and also individuals
156.56,6.319,and it really provides us with a smarter
159.2,6.24,way to perform analysis
162.879,4.321,so as we think about spatial analysis
165.44,4.32,and data science
167.2,4.0,these are at the heart of what most gis
169.76,3.44,professionals do
171.2,3.84,it's about solving problems and
173.2,4.0,advancing science
175.04,4.559,this year here at esri we've added a lot
177.2,4.24,of new tools and improved existing ones
179.599,4.161,we introduced many
181.44,3.92,new algorithms new tools for ai and
183.76,4.64,machine learning and big data and
185.36,4.879,scripting and some great tools for data
188.4,3.6,engineering i want to underscore those
190.239,3.28,there are some really great new tools
192.0,3.92,for data engineering as well as
193.519,5.121,forecasting including a method to allow
195.92,4.56,you to evaluate forecast by location and
198.64,3.92,choose the right method whether that's
200.48,4.96,curve fit or exponential smoothing or
202.56,5.28,random force based on your data
205.44,4.24,and we we did already a great webinar on
207.84,3.84,that so if you're interested in that
209.68,4.72,take a look at our webinar series and
211.68,3.919,take a look at those tools but today
214.4,4.0,we're here
215.599,4.961,to talk about some other areas and the
218.4,4.479,innovations and advances in gis
220.56,4.08,analytics are allowing us to really see
222.879,4.561,some of these new patterns and create
224.64,4.72,insights with predictive modeling and
227.44,4.56,analyzing of spatial temporal
229.36,2.64,information
232.159,5.921,the ability to enrich our data with glai
235.76,4.88,and machine learning is just incredible
238.08,4.64,and the ability to perform advanced
240.64,3.84,raster analytics as well and we're going
242.72,5.12,to touch on a lot of these areas as we
244.48,6.56,get into our demonstrations
247.84,5.84,i want to remind you to think about
251.04,5.039,always the spatial analysis and data
253.68,4.799,science framework as well
256.079,4.241,we need to think about our approach
258.479,4.401,my colleague lauren bennett likes to say
260.32,4.56,you know we don't just do data science
262.88,4.16,we start with a problem we identify the
264.88,5.12,people that we need to work with we find
267.04,5.12,and prepare the data visualize explore
270.0,4.56,and analyze that data and then use the
272.16,3.759,chosen method to help us get to an
274.56,3.04,answer
275.919,4.241,this could be by a clustering for
277.6,5.52,example or classification or or a
280.16,4.4,regression analysis and the reason that
283.12,4.639,we do this
284.56,4.4,again is to understand perhaps what has
287.759,4.241,happened
288.96,5.679,what could happen or what we should do
292.0,4.56,we use it to solve real world problems
294.639,5.361,to answer questions and that could be
296.56,6.0,descriptive predictive or prescriptive
300.0,4.32,so we see this very clearly over the
302.56,4.24,last 18 months i think with the use of
304.32,4.4,of dashboards helping us to understand
306.8,5.76,describe and predict what was happening
308.72,5.28,with cobit as it spread around the globe
312.56,3.52,now i don't want to spend too much
314.0,3.84,talking again we've got some great
316.08,2.959,demonstrations for us we've got some
317.84,3.44,great things to share we're going to
319.039,4.88,touch on deep learning training data
321.28,5.04,population estimation network analysis
323.919,3.521,hydro analysis dems cost service
326.32,3.2,analysis
327.44,4.4,a lot as you can tell
329.52,4.32,so with that i want to
331.84,4.32,ask my colleague kate to get ready with
333.84,4.16,that first demonstration but noelle can
336.16,3.92,i throw it over to you for a first poll
338.0,4.4,question
340.08,4.559,yes and let me launch that
342.4,4.32,so this is a question where you can
344.639,4.4,select all the answers that apply and
346.72,4.72,we're interested in understanding what
349.039,4.72,area would you be most interested in
351.44,4.8,learning more about in spatial analysis
353.759,5.44,and data science we'll keep this open
356.24,5.519,for a little bit so all of you can enter
359.199,6.84,in your responses and then we will share
361.759,4.28,them with all of you when we're done
368.639,3.041,yeah there's there's so much that's
370.479,2.641,important here again we want to
371.68,2.959,understand you know what's most
373.12,4.0,important to you we heard a lot about
374.639,4.56,data engineering earlier this year
377.12,4.32,but really want to understand where are
379.199,4.881,you at in your process today what's
381.44,2.64,important to you
384.479,3.761,i'm going to go ahead and close this now
386.24,3.36,and share those results thanks for
388.24,3.679,responding
389.6,3.76,and wow linda it looks like a lot of
391.919,3.361,people here are interested in learning
393.36,5.36,about the spatial analysis modeling and
395.28,5.68,scripting so that's that's promising
398.72,2.24,yeah
401.759,5.081,all right i will go ahead and send this
404.4,5.84,back over to our presenters thank
406.84,5.32,you yeah okay over to you
410.24,3.76,great thanks
412.16,4.08,so today in our demos we're going to be
414.0,3.68,looking at the general theme of access
416.24,4.799,and how we can calculate it with
417.68,5.359,different levels of data availability
421.039,4.081,i'll start with a high data scenario in
423.039,3.6,new york city where we have fine-grained
425.12,2.639,population data
426.639,2.56,in this case through the business
427.759,3.921,analyst tools
429.199,4.961,and detailed network data from arcgis
431.68,4.56,street map premium
434.16,4.08,after that we'll look at vaccine site
436.24,4.56,access in uganda using the distance
438.24,4.239,accumulation tool and esri's population
440.8,3.119,estimate data
442.479,3.84,and then finally we'll start from
443.919,4.801,imagery over a rohingya refugee camp and
446.319,4.481,use deep learning to extract tents then
448.72,5.52,calculate access to washrooms and see
450.8,3.44,which tents are at risk of flooding
454.319,4.32,so first let's look at new york city and
456.319,4.241,access to green space
458.639,5.201,i have a point layer here with all the
460.56,5.199,entrances to parks in the city
463.84,4.32,going to take the detailed network data
465.759,4.241,set that's available for new york city
468.16,4.24,and bring it into our network analysis
470.0,2.4,tools
473.36,4.88,within these tools
475.28,5.039,we have a few different workflow options
478.24,3.679,so we could find the closest park to a
480.319,4.0,specific building
481.919,5.28,we could do route optimization
484.319,5.361,or we could pick the best place
487.199,5.84,to locate a park based on the target
489.68,5.04,demographics in the surrounding area
493.039,3.681,but today we're going to do a service
494.72,3.919,area analysis
496.72,4.4,to find out which areas and then how
498.639,5.201,many people are served by each park in
501.12,2.72,new york city
504.56,4.4,in order to calculate a service area
507.28,3.28,once it loads in here
508.96,4.4,all i'll need to do
510.56,4.64,is add my facilities so in this case
513.36,4.0,the park entrances
515.2,4.56,and then select my mode we have a few
517.36,4.479,different options to choose from here
519.76,3.759,so there's the normal driving time and
521.839,2.881,driving distance
523.519,3.281,there's a different setting for
524.72,4.4,emergency vehicles and then other
526.8,4.4,options for rural driving distance or
529.12,3.68,trucking driving distance where it's
531.2,4.56,going to take into account different
532.8,4.8,features of the road segments
535.76,3.44,but today we're going to take a look at
537.6,3.12,walking time
539.2,4.639,and see
540.72,5.76,how men hollow which areas are within a
543.839,5.041,5 and 10 minute walk towards a park in
546.48,4.64,new york city
548.88,4.24,this tool also has the option to specify
551.12,2.96,a specific date and time or day of the
553.12,2.8,week
554.08,3.52,as you can see the data that we have for
555.92,4.0,new york city
557.6,4.56,includes live traffic data as well as
559.92,4.72,historic traffic data so we could take a
562.16,5.52,look at how the conditions differ if i'm
564.64,5.44,trying to get to a park on a weekend or
567.68,3.599,maybe in the middle of a weekday
570.08,3.6,but today we'll just keep it more
571.279,4.0,generic
573.68,4.56,when i run this tool
575.279,5.041,i get an output
578.24,3.12,showing all of the five-minute service
580.32,2.0,areas
581.36,2.8,that are
582.32,4.0,areas where i can walk from within five
584.16,5.6,minutes to any point in these polygons
586.32,7.199,and get to the park entrance
589.76,6.0,if i zoom in i can see how this is using
593.519,4.0,the network data set
595.76,2.72,for example here
597.519,3.361,the
598.48,4.4,access polygon is
600.88,3.84,is not a perfect circle
602.88,3.84,it's going to be shaped specifically
604.72,4.239,around the different
606.72,5.28,roads that people have access to to walk
608.959,3.041,towards the green space
613.68,3.68,now that we have the areas that are
615.279,3.441,within a five minute walk of green space
617.36,3.599,the next
618.72,5.92,step of our analysis will be to find out
620.959,3.681,who lives in these access areas
625.2,3.199,now because there are some overlaps
626.8,3.279,where people are within walking distance
628.399,2.801,of two parks and we don't want to double
630.079,3.041,count them
631.2,3.759,i've already run the dissolve tool so
633.12,5.279,that we have just one layer covering all
634.959,3.44,of the five minute walk areas
639.279,3.761,in order to add population data to our
641.279,5.68,five minute walk time service areas
643.04,6.16,we're going to use the enrich tool
646.959,4.161,so i can see for this geographic area we
649.2,4.16,have access to lots of different options
651.12,4.56,for demographic variables
653.36,5.36,i could explore these by category or i
655.68,6.8,could search across all of the variables
658.72,3.76,so we're interested in population
663.839,2.881,we have data available here from
665.2,3.68,different sources
666.72,5.2,so i'll take the 2020 population
668.88,3.04,estimate from esri
672.24,4.96,and then
673.68,6.64,i'll take a u.s census data set on the
677.2,3.12,number of households
681.6,5.84,we could also look at information
684.24,6.24,on the uh how equitable access is so i
687.44,5.839,could look at households above and below
690.48,4.64,the poverty level to compare how many of
693.279,3.521,them how many people in each category
695.12,3.92,live within a five minute access to a
696.8,2.24,park
699.44,3.92,once i've selected my variables i can
701.6,4.0,run this tool
703.36,4.88,and it's going to add that data directly
705.6,5.679,to our enriched polygon or directly to
708.24,4.64,our dissolved polygon layer
711.279,2.641,so now i can see that for all of the
712.88,3.6,areas
713.92,4.64,falling within these polygons
716.48,3.76,there are four million two hundred and
718.56,4.079,sixty six thousand people who live
720.24,5.2,within a five minute walk of green space
722.639,2.801,in new york city
727.519,3.44,and we could continue with that analysis
729.12,4.08,further to compare the demographics of
730.959,4.161,those living closer to a park to those
733.2,4.319,who live without easy access to green
735.12,2.399,space
738.959,4.0,another way to visualize this data is to
740.8,5.12,use census block groups which we can
742.959,4.88,download from the living atlas
745.92,4.0,here i have sized each point by their
747.839,4.161,block group population and then colored
749.92,4.0,them with the walk time data
752.0,4.079,so anything in light green is going to
753.92,4.4,be within a five minute walk of a park
756.079,5.521,dark green is within 10 minutes and red
758.32,5.44,is further than a 10 minute walk away
761.6,3.44,so now we can see at a glance the air
763.76,3.199,where there are areas of large
765.04,4.16,populations without access to green
766.959,4.081,space
769.2,3.28,i can publish this map and share it with
771.04,3.44,decision makers
772.48,4.64,using the power of gis and spatial
774.48,4.56,analysis to identify a pattern and then
777.12,3.92,bring attention to a problem
779.04,4.64,[Music]
781.04,4.4,now this use case in new york has been
783.68,4.0,an example where i have all of the data
785.44,4.079,that i need easily accessible
787.68,3.92,we had accurate population data all the
789.519,3.681,way down to the block group level and
791.6,3.359,that detailed network layer that
793.2,4.48,included details like traffic patterns
794.959,4.721,by time and day
797.68,4.48,but in many cases this level of data is
799.68,4.24,not available
802.16,3.76,luckily with a different set of spatial
803.92,4.0,analysis tools we can still calculate
805.92,4.479,access and make maps to drive decision
807.92,2.479,making
810.56,4.16,for our next analysis question we want
812.56,3.92,to see how many people are being served
814.72,3.679,by the current vaccine distribution
816.48,4.32,sites located in the gulu district of
818.399,4.56,uganda
820.8,4.08,before we get into our analysis we need
822.959,3.361,to check the data availability to
824.88,4.16,determine the best methods for our
826.32,5.759,analysis
829.04,5.599,we can check demographic global
832.079,3.76,data coverage and we can see based on
834.639,3.361,the legend that there's some data
835.839,4.0,available for 2019
838.0,3.839,but when i select uganda i can see that
839.839,4.401,this only goes down to the district
841.839,4.721,level geography so this isn't going to
844.24,4.88,be enough when we're trying to look at
846.56,5.76,access within one specific district to
849.12,4.56,these different vaccine sites
852.32,3.04,we can also look at the street map
853.68,3.92,premium coverage
855.36,4.4,in this publicly available map
857.6,5.359,and we can see that for uganda we're
859.76,5.439,only going to have major roads available
862.959,5.56,unlike the highly local roads we had in
865.199,3.32,new york city
871.839,4.641,so even with this amount of data we can
874.32,4.16,still quantify vaccine accessibility in
876.48,4.0,the gulu route in the gulu region of
878.48,3.84,uganda
880.48,4.56,we're going to use
882.32,5.68,the highways that we already have
885.04,5.28,combine that with slope data
888.0,4.32,land cover and rivers
890.32,4.16,and perform spatial analysis on these
892.32,4.879,geographic features in order to
894.48,4.08,calculate access
897.199,3.521,and our ultimate goal here is to
898.56,4.079,identify which areas and then how many
900.72,4.88,people are within a one hour walk from
902.639,2.961,the vaccine sites
906.56,3.68,to more accurately calculate the
908.079,5.44,distance walkable in an hour we're going
910.24,4.959,to create a cost raster
913.519,3.601,so this raster will have a value for
915.199,3.841,each cell indicating the cost or
917.12,3.839,essentially the difficulty of traveling
919.04,3.68,through it
920.959,3.68,to create this raster we're going to
922.72,3.84,take the four layers that we already
924.639,5.041,have as our source data sets the
926.56,5.04,highways land cover rivers and slope
929.68,4.079,and then we're going to reclassify them
931.6,4.96,on a scale of 1 to 10
933.759,5.08,where 1 is the lowest cost to traverse
936.56,3.92,and 10 is the highest or
938.839,4.281,hardest
940.48,4.159,so in my reclassified rasters
943.12,3.04,you can see that we've simplified this
944.639,3.361,data
946.16,4.4,now i can see that the southern sections
948.0,4.399,of the district that are mostly cropland
950.56,3.199,are going to be easier to walk through
952.399,4.161,than the northern areas that are
953.759,4.0,primarily forested
956.56,2.959,you can see in the legend that we've
957.759,6.32,also set rivers as the hardest to
959.519,4.56,traverse and highways as the easiest
964.8,5.2,now that i have my four reclassified
966.8,5.039,inputs we can run the weighted sum tool
970.0,3.92,to combine the weights giving us one
971.839,4.641,value for how difficult it is to cross
973.92,2.56,each cell
978.88,3.759,and in that cost raster
980.88,3.759,we can now start to visualize which
982.639,3.761,sites will be easier to travel to in
984.639,4.241,green
986.4,3.92,[Music]
988.88,3.84,to take this further and to get a
990.32,4.4,walkable area for each vaccine site we
992.72,5.52,will input our cost raster into the
994.72,3.52,distance accumulation tool
1001.92,3.68,now for this tool
1003.759,4.32,we're going to use all of the data that
1005.6,3.679,we've put together so far
1008.079,2.88,so our
1009.279,4.321,sort our feature of interest is the
1010.959,5.601,vaccine sites
1013.6,5.76,the barrier is going to be the rivers
1016.56,4.88,our surface raster will be the elevation
1019.36,4.08,and this elevation raster is what's
1021.44,4.32,going to be used to calculate the actual
1023.44,4.399,surface distance that's been covered
1025.76,5.84,when people are traveling through these
1027.839,5.521,cells on their way to the vaccine sites
1031.6,3.92,the cost raster is made up of all the
1033.36,3.36,different factors that we just talked
1035.52,3.84,about
1036.72,3.92,and finally i just need to indicate that
1039.36,3.52,the maximum
1040.64,3.919,the maximum accumulation or the total
1042.88,4.079,distance we're going to travel
1044.559,6.321,is not going to exceed one hour and then
1046.959,3.921,we're traveling toward the vaccine sites
1051.52,3.36,now when i run this distance
1052.88,3.36,accumulation tool
1054.88,4.4,i get an output that looks pretty
1056.24,5.92,similar to the output layers we had
1059.28,4.96,from the service areas analysis in new
1062.16,4.24,york city
1064.24,4.24,and we can immediately see that the
1066.4,4.32,areas accessible in the green parts of
1068.48,4.0,the map are larger than those in the
1070.72,4.16,yellow parts of the map
1072.48,5.12,which is as we expected from our initial
1074.88,2.72,look at the data
1078.72,4.319,now we want to know how many people are
1080.4,4.0,being served by these vaccine sites
1083.039,3.121,but we don't have the detailed
1084.4,4.08,demographic data like we did for new
1086.16,2.32,york
1089.28,5.12,in cases like this
1092.32,4.4,we can use additional data sets
1094.4,3.36,like esri's world population estimate
1096.72,2.64,layer
1097.76,5.159,which we can access
1099.36,3.559,from the living atlas
1110.24,4.319,this data set was created with a model
1112.16,5.28,that combines imagery road intersection
1114.559,4.641,density populated places and urban
1117.44,4.72,footprints to create a raster of
1119.2,4.8,population with a cell size of about 250
1122.16,4.399,meters
1124.0,4.88,the population then of each polygon
1126.559,4.161,within a country was normalized to the
1128.88,7.0,un's population estimates for each
1130.72,5.16,country to further ensure its accuracy
1136.799,4.081,when we load in this data we can start
1138.799,4.801,to see how it will line up with our
1140.88,4.799,vaccine access sites and further explore
1143.6,2.079,it
1148.24,4.08,so we're expecting the most uh the
1150.48,2.8,highest population to be in the city of
1152.32,2.8,gulu
1153.28,3.6,in the middle and if i select a cell in
1155.12,4.32,the middle of the city
1156.88,6.64,we can see that about 280 people live
1159.44,5.84,within or nearby this 250 meter cell
1163.52,3.44,then i can compare that to somewhere
1165.28,3.92,further from the city
1166.96,3.44,and see that just 112 people are living
1169.2,4.4,in this cell
1170.4,3.2,further from the main city
1174.24,3.84,now to get a more accurate count
1176.32,2.719,of the number of people served within
1178.08,2.959,each
1179.039,4.081,access area we can use the zonal
1181.039,5.681,statistics tool
1183.12,6.4,so for this tool all we have to input
1186.72,5.44,is our featured data
1189.52,4.56,so the world population data
1192.16,4.08,or in this case that will be our one
1194.08,3.76,hour walk accessibility
1196.24,4.64,then we'll look at the population
1197.84,6.719,estimate and the output will show
1200.88,5.919,the sum of all of the population
1204.559,4.081,of all the population cells that fall
1206.799,4.561,within that polygon of walk
1208.64,4.96,accessibility
1211.36,4.96,so when i run this tool
1213.6,4.64,we get an output
1216.32,3.04,where i've colored each of these
1218.24,2.96,different
1219.36,3.52,service areas by the number of people
1221.2,3.92,that they serve
1222.88,3.36,and we can immediately see that three of
1225.12,2.72,the different
1226.24,3.919,vaccine sites
1227.84,4.719,are not going to be within an hour
1230.159,5.041,walking distance for any of the citizens
1232.559,4.401,of this area
1235.2,4.0,and this is at least based on the esri
1236.96,4.32,population estimates but these are sites
1239.2,3.599,that we may want to consider relocating
1241.28,4.08,so that we can better serve the gulu
1242.799,4.401,population
1245.36,3.52,with this analysis we were able to
1247.2,3.52,answer our question of how many people
1248.88,4.4,are being served by the vaccine sites in
1250.72,4.88,gulu without a sophisticated network
1253.28,3.92,data set or high resolution population
1255.6,2.959,data
1257.2,2.88,this is the power of the spatial
1258.559,3.281,analysis tools
1260.08,4.88,they allow us to solve problems with
1261.84,5.12,different levels of input data
1264.96,4.0,now to further illustrate this i'm going
1266.96,6.24,to pass it over to rami to do an
1268.96,4.24,accessibility analysis for a refugee
1275.44,0.0,thank you camp
1282.96,3.599,hello everyone thank you for being here
1285.2,2.719,today
1286.559,2.881,so
1287.919,3.441,through our presentation today we're
1289.44,2.88,going to go through
1291.36,3.36,another
1292.32,4.0,workflow of spatial analysis that we're
1294.72,3.76,going to study
1296.32,5.04,the rohingya refugee camp
1298.48,6.079,and to start with we wanted to focus on
1301.36,6.24,sdg6 which is ensuring availability and
1304.559,5.201,sustainable management of water
1307.6,4.16,under this sdg there are six eight
1309.76,4.0,different targets and we're going to be
1311.76,4.48,touching these targets through our
1313.76,4.159,analysis
1316.24,3.76,to start with our analysis we had to
1317.919,4.64,pick up our study area and for that we
1320.0,5.2,focused on the cox bizarre region which
1322.559,4.24,is on the borders of myanmar in
1325.2,3.92,bangladesh
1326.799,4.481,and if we zoom in
1329.12,3.84,this regions host something around 1
1331.28,4.399,million refugees
1332.96,5.04,and we wanted to focus on a small area
1335.679,4.321,for the availability of data
1338.0,4.48,and to ensure that we're getting the
1340.0,4.799,best out of the tools
1342.48,4.4,so as we go forward we had to ask couple
1344.799,4.401,of questions for our analysis what
1346.88,4.56,percent of populations live in the most
1349.2,4.24,critical areas of flooding how many
1351.44,4.719,washrooms and latvines are located
1353.44,4.96,within these the most critical
1356.159,4.161,areas of flooding and what percent of
1358.4,4.159,refugee camp
1360.32,5.12,do not have access to a washroom within
1362.559,5.201,a 2.5 minute walk time
1365.44,4.64,to answer question 1
1367.76,3.919,we were able to find that 27 percent of
1370.08,4.16,the population
1371.679,5.201,actually lives in flooding area which is
1374.24,5.12,a really high number for refugees
1376.88,5.36,and there and from within this area
1379.36,5.84,there's around 100 latrines and 45
1382.24,4.16,washrooms that are in critical flooding
1385.2,2.64,risk
1386.4,3.04,what we're seeing on the screen is the
1387.84,3.6,dashboard that is showing the end
1389.44,4.8,results and we're going to be going
1391.44,4.719,through the process on how we got here
1394.24,3.76,but start with the dashboard is telling
1396.159,3.601,us where are these
1398.0,3.36,washrooms where are they sitting in the
1399.76,3.52,highest flood areas
1401.36,4.96,and then it's telling us how many people
1403.28,4.16,are sitting within these tents
1406.32,4.239,moreover
1407.44,5.68,if we go to question three there's 24 of
1410.559,4.961,the population that actually lives
1413.12,5.28,in more than 2.5 minutes walk time to
1415.52,3.76,get into a washroom which is alone a big
1418.4,2.56,thing
1419.28,3.759,the dashboard we're seeing on the screen
1420.96,4.24,is actually telling us
1423.039,4.321,where are these tents who got access and
1425.2,3.68,who doesn't and who's living within a
1427.36,3.76,walking distance
1428.88,4.96,in our study area there's an estimate of
1431.12,5.52,32 000 people living there and we can
1433.84,6.719,see that 11 900 of them doesn't really
1436.64,3.919,have access to washrooms
1440.64,5.44,so to start our analysis our first
1443.52,5.759,challenge was to find data reasonable
1446.08,5.04,data for refugee areas and for that we
1449.279,3.76,wanted to utilize the power of deep
1451.12,4.0,learning within arcgis pro
1453.039,4.88,we were able to get hands on publicly
1455.12,5.28,available drone imagery by iom or
1457.919,4.0,international organization of migration
1460.4,4.159,what you're seeing on the screen is a
1461.919,5.12,sample of this drone energy imagery and
1464.559,4.961,what you're seeing in blue is the first
1467.039,4.401,one of the deep learning model
1469.52,4.24,we use an out of the box deep learning
1471.44,5.04,model that is available in living atlas
1473.76,4.56,for africa and since this model was
1476.48,3.84,trained in africa we weren't expecting
1478.32,4.0,to get the best results and you can see
1480.32,3.76,that in the screen
1482.32,3.68,the model is actually detecting couple
1484.08,4.56,of buildings but it's not giving me the
1486.0,3.36,full story of foreign it's missing tons
1488.64,3.2,of
1489.36,5.04,tents and i want that
1491.84,3.839,so enabled in order to accomplish that
1494.4,3.36,we had to
1495.679,4.48,retrain the model and to retrain the
1497.76,4.08,model we had to digitize all of this
1500.159,4.0,area which is approximately three
1501.84,4.719,thousand refugee tents
1504.159,4.961,it took us a while to digitize this and
1506.559,4.561,then we used the export training data
1509.12,6.08,for deep learning in arcgis pro which
1511.12,6.32,you can see on the screen
1515.2,4.56,through a certain metadata format we
1517.44,5.119,were able to export these chips that are
1519.76,5.12,labeled with the data we want
1522.559,4.081,moving forward we trained our model
1524.88,4.88,through train deep learning models in
1526.64,5.36,arcgis pro we imported we inputted the
1529.76,5.6,training data that we exported and we
1532.0,5.039,ran the model it took around 20 hours to
1535.36,3.76,retrain the model
1537.039,4.561,and the actual reported accuracy is
1539.12,4.72,something around 85
1541.6,4.72,which means that from the images that
1543.84,6.719,we've got the model will get something
1546.32,4.239,around 85 percent of the buildings
1551.279,5.041,moving forward we had to test the model
1554.32,3.52,and we're going to start with the first
1556.32,3.28,initial view
1557.84,3.6,the model from africa and this is a
1559.6,3.6,complete different area so as we're
1561.44,3.92,seeing here yes the model isn't giving
1563.2,4.24,the best results but what happens after
1565.36,4.08,we try our model
1567.44,4.32,is pretty fascinating we're able to
1569.44,5.44,locate these stents attempt by tent and
1571.76,5.44,get pretty accurate results so if i zoom
1574.88,6.08,in to take a closer look i'm gonna see
1577.2,5.76,that the intense footprints are there
1580.96,4.56,and they're pretty accurate
1582.96,4.48,we're seeing that the the edges aren't
1585.52,4.48,smooth and this is because this is the
1587.44,5.44,row output of the model
1590.0,5.6,and further analysis will be able to qa
1592.88,5.919,qc this data and make use of it
1595.6,5.76,as we move forward in our process
1598.799,4.88,we wanted to label these steps so the
1601.36,5.04,first step was actually regularizing the
1603.679,4.401,tense so we can see these edges smooth
1606.4,3.92,and looking nice and having a good
1608.08,4.16,footprint the second was how can we
1610.32,4.56,classify these distance how can we get
1612.24,4.72,what tent is used for
1614.88,4.0,for that also i am sure the camp
1616.96,4.48,facilities layer
1618.88,4.32,in this flare there's different uses the
1621.44,4.719,points you see on the screen and they
1623.2,5.28,vary across washrooms latrines water
1626.159,6.081,tanks masks etc
1628.48,3.76,we use the spatial join tool
1632.559,4.24,with our tents in order to get the use
1635.44,3.599,of each tent
1636.799,5.041,so at this point each stand each
1639.039,4.721,footprint that we extracted got a use
1641.84,4.079,we labeled everything and we got the
1643.76,3.919,refugee tents so everything in red is
1645.919,4.401,actually a tent that is occupied by
1647.679,4.801,people living in it and everything else
1650.32,4.56,is services and facilities
1652.48,4.559,we zoom in and take closer look the
1654.88,4.399,tents look good and what we are mostly
1657.039,4.401,interested in for the analysis today is
1659.279,4.161,the blue ones which are latvines
1661.44,5.44,washrooms and toilets
1663.44,5.76,and the red ones which are refugee tents
1666.88,4.08,as we move forward in our analysis we
1669.2,3.92,wanted to get an estimate of the
1670.96,3.52,population and this was a little bit of
1673.12,3.52,a tricky part
1674.48,4.799,but gathering some data we were able to
1676.64,4.88,locate that unhcr estimates that in the
1679.279,4.561,rohingya camps there's approximately one
1681.52,3.2,person living in every eight square
1683.84,3.199,meter
1684.72,5.04,and we got the areas of the tents we got
1687.039,5.12,the dance classified that helped us with
1689.76,4.24,a little bit of python we utilized the
1692.159,4.4,search cursors and update cursors
1694.0,5.44,function we were able to estimate how
1696.559,4.801,many people are living within each tenth
1699.44,4.64,so in our area of interest there's
1701.36,6.4,approximately 32 000 people and they're
1704.08,6.16,divided across these users
1707.76,4.159,as we move forward we also mentioned the
1710.24,5.36,washrooms and we wanted to know the
1711.919,6.721,washroom capacity another unhcr kpi says
1715.6,4.4,that each set each six square meters of
1718.64,2.8,a washroom
1720.0,4.799,usually can accommodate for
1721.44,5.839,approximately seven households per day
1724.799,4.641,and an average household and
1727.279,3.12,the rohingya camps is approximately six
1729.44,3.04,people
1730.399,4.721,so doing the math over the population
1732.48,4.72,and utilizing python again we were able
1735.12,4.08,to get how many
1737.2,4.4,households we can accommodate for and
1739.2,5.28,that's around three point four
1741.6,4.88,thousand and how many households we've
1744.48,4.16,got which is six point nine thousands
1746.48,4.4,and that's the first triggering thing
1748.64,4.56,there's a lot more households than the
1750.88,4.56,washrooms in such an area which means
1753.2,5.92,that the people aren't really being
1755.44,3.68,served enough for the refugees
1759.6,5.12,moving forward in this analysis after we
1762.0,4.559,located the things we're looking for the
1764.72,3.439,dance uses that we're looking for we
1766.559,3.681,wanted to go
1768.159,4.321,further and understand
1770.24,4.96,who is at risk and to answer these we
1772.48,4.72,started with our flood risk analysis
1775.2,4.719,in the flood risk analysis we were able
1777.2,5.359,to find these contour lines on hdx human
1779.919,4.961,data exchange hub
1782.559,5.12,which has a high resolution contour
1784.88,4.72,lines that's approximately one meter
1787.679,3.681,we were able from these contour lines to
1789.6,3.76,drive the digital elevation model you're
1791.36,4.16,seeing here which i bet a lot of you who
1793.36,4.16,do special analysis are pretty familiar
1795.52,3.84,with digital models
1797.52,5.6,after we got the digital elevation model
1799.36,5.52,for our area we were able to utilize one
1803.12,3.439,of the learned lessons that is available
1804.88,4.32,for you
1806.559,4.961,to help us predict floods with with unit
1809.2,4.479,hydrographs
1811.52,4.32,walking through this analysis we were
1813.679,4.0,able to create the
1815.84,4.4,watershed that we're seeing here with
1817.679,5.201,the flood areas and locate the high risk
1820.24,4.799,flood areas and these are in the blue
1822.88,4.159,the tanks that overlay them are those
1825.039,4.0,stands that are at risk
1827.039,4.481,i'll jump to arcgis pro and show you
1829.039,5.12,what's been done here briefly so we've
1831.52,4.639,created our watershed through pro
1834.159,4.481,and then we got the tents that are
1836.159,3.681,intersecting our highest risk
1838.64,2.96,we have
1839.84,3.6,all the tents in the flood zone but
1841.6,3.84,we're more interested in the ones that
1843.44,4.32,are at high risk which are these and
1845.44,5.04,then from these we filtered the refugee
1847.76,4.399,tents and the washrooms so if i take a
1850.48,4.319,closer look at this
1852.159,4.961,i'll be able to see that yes these are
1854.799,4.72,all at risk and i do have estimate of
1857.12,4.559,population of these that are at risk
1859.519,4.0,which we saw in the first dashboard to
1861.679,2.72,do this we've actually utilized model
1863.519,3.04,builder
1864.399,4.321,and it's a one click that helped us
1866.559,4.401,automate the whole process
1868.72,4.48,i'll jump back to my story map to keep
1870.96,4.079,going
1873.2,4.24,the next step was to create a network
1875.039,4.64,analysis or a network data set in order
1877.44,4.079,to figure out from these stands who got
1879.679,3.441,access who is within the proximity and
1881.519,3.681,who's known
1883.12,5.12,we to create the network data set we
1885.2,5.44,utilized osm data that is available for
1888.24,4.159,the rohingya camps and we use this model
1890.64,3.68,builder which goes through the process
1892.399,4.16,of filtering the roads within our area
1894.32,5.199,of interest creating the network data
1896.559,3.84,set and giving us a final network data
1899.519,2.961,set
1900.399,4.801,this network data set got two main
1902.48,3.919,components which are the walking time
1905.2,3.599,that's a
1906.399,3.841,kpi also derived from the sphere minimum
1908.799,3.281,standards and indicators for
1910.24,5.2,humanitarian response
1912.08,5.839,which says 83 like in a refugee area and
1915.44,4.56,a walkable area you can do around 83
1917.919,4.48,meters walking per minute and we
1920.0,5.84,embedded that into our
1922.399,5.841,network data set in our costs the next
1925.84,4.719,thing that we did is we actually made
1928.24,5.439,sure that the dem is in the network
1930.559,5.521,analysis or the network data set because
1933.679,4.401,the area is a slopey area and the
1936.08,6.479,variation of slope might
1938.08,6.479,get people to the place in a longer time
1942.559,4.161,the next step was we wanted to test our
1944.559,4.561,network anal network data set make sure
1946.72,3.6,that it's giving us good service areas
1949.12,3.36,and that's what we're seeing on this
1950.32,4.0,screen dropping a point seeing how far
1952.48,4.079,is the distance seeing if it's getting
1954.32,5.52,the meat the distance doesn't really
1956.559,5.6,write numbers and so on
1959.84,5.28,after getting that we had to plug this
1962.159,4.081,network analysis to our row input data
1965.12,3.919,for the
1966.24,5.84,refugee tanks that we created and the
1969.039,5.36,washrooms we specified the 2.5 minutes
1972.08,5.04,matrix and then we used the location
1974.399,5.841,allocation tool this is a very
1977.12,6.0,complicated looks like model but the end
1980.24,5.039,result of that model looks
1983.12,3.439,interesting because we're able to flag
1985.279,3.76,these tents
1986.559,5.281,and we're able to see that anything in
1989.039,5.841,red is more than 2.5 minutes anything in
1991.84,5.439,orange is at risk 1 to 2.5 minutes and
1994.88,4.56,anything in green is well served so as
1997.279,4.161,we can see all these
1999.44,4.239,red tents aren't actually being served
2001.44,4.4,they don't have accessible washrooms and
2003.679,3.441,that will create a huge issue for the
2005.84,4.4,people living
2007.12,3.12,within these areas
2011.519,6.841,that's it for me and thank you i'll give
2014.96,3.4,it back to linda
2019.2,4.319,yeah thanks ronnie that was really great
2021.039,5.36,and i know there's a lot there to uh to
2023.519,5.121,unpack um i think noelle why don't we uh
2026.399,3.52,do our next uh poll question if you
2028.64,2.159,would
2029.919,4.401,yeah
2030.799,6.0,so we are now asking you to choose one
2034.32,5.12,of the following and we are interested
2036.799,5.441,in understanding if you are using data
2039.44,5.52,science methods or spatial analysis in
2042.24,5.679,your organization today we'll keep this
2044.96,4.879,up for a few moments so everyone has
2047.919,4.561,time to
2049.839,2.641,to reply
2056.079,4.56,yeah we saw so many
2058.24,4.399,great things there with the the the work
2060.639,5.04,between kate and ramy and different
2062.639,5.52,methods and different levels of uh
2065.679,5.68,granularity of data that's available i
2068.159,5.281,think this area of data science is just
2071.359,3.681,exploding and it's really exciting to
2073.44,3.36,see the work that you all are doing as
2075.04,3.52,well so again we just want to understand
2076.8,4.16,where you are in the process and how we
2078.56,2.4,can help
2082.32,5.519,and with that we will go ahead and close
2085.679,4.48,the poll
2087.839,4.08,share the results
2090.159,5.2,and
2091.919,5.761,a majority of our audience today says
2095.359,4.161,that you have been using it for more
2097.68,4.399,than 12 months
2099.52,4.64,so that's fantastic to hear so there was
2102.079,3.52,there's a lot of yeses in this session
2104.16,4.48,today
2105.599,4.961,good a lot of advanced users
2108.64,5.04,great
2110.56,4.08,well thanks again for that noelle um
2113.68,3.439,i'm gonna
2114.64,5.84,move us forward i want to make sure you
2117.119,3.361,can see my screen okay
2126.16,6.08,so i want to just sum things up a bit
2129.359,5.041,for us because we don't see your screen
2132.24,3.04,yet linda sorry for nothing that's all
2134.4,2.88,right
2135.28,5.6,that's why i was double checking there
2137.28,5.36,we go perfect we can see it good good so
2140.88,3.84,i wanted to uh
2142.64,4.16,sort of sum things up i mean we saw a
2144.72,4.08,lot of different types of analysis in
2146.8,3.12,there and this is important for us as
2148.8,3.68,you know we're working in our
2149.92,5.52,organizations today um and and
2152.48,5.84,everybody's being asked to to do more
2155.44,4.8,and to deliver information much more
2158.32,4.56,quickly and and everybody wants better
2160.24,4.32,resolution and higher quality data
2162.88,4.719,and so that's our challenge and how do
2164.56,4.799,we do that um you know and and uh
2167.599,3.76,maybe we're doing that with less people
2169.359,5.041,in our organization or less time as
2171.359,5.041,we're being asked to do more and more
2174.4,4.32,hopefully what you saw here is how some
2176.4,4.64,of these tools can really help you
2178.72,5.28,become more responsive and speed
2181.04,6.079,information to those decision makers
2184.0,6.4,by using this technology and uh you know
2187.119,7.121,data analysis and data science um you're
2190.4,6.8,able to do uh much more and uh increase
2194.24,4.72,your efficiency and expand your capacity
2197.2,3.76,right being able to do an analysis like
2198.96,3.6,we just saw in rohingya
2200.96,2.96,you know now that we've done that how
2202.56,3.76,can we
2203.92,5.76,share that information to the decision
2206.32,6.519,makers you know and and help engage
2209.68,7.36,um at the community level and make an
2212.839,5.961,impact so with that i do want to
2217.04,3.76,leave you with a lot of resources and
2218.8,3.68,again this is being recorded today we
2220.8,3.279,will share the recording we will share
2222.48,2.879,the slides we will share all of these
2224.079,3.201,great links
2225.359,3.041,lots of things out there for you to get
2227.28,3.6,your hands on
2228.4,5.6,including a great uh
2230.88,4.959,story map you know the refugee tent deep
2234.0,3.28,learning package which is out there now
2235.839,2.721,as well
2237.28,3.04,and some of the other things that you
2238.56,4.48,see on the screen and of course i want
2240.32,4.48,to point out our learn lessons as well a
2243.04,3.6,lot of great stuff and learn as as
2244.8,4.559,romney had highlighted
2246.64,6.16,so with that noel i think we want to
2249.359,5.201,throw it open for a q a session so i'll
2252.8,4.319,throw it over to you
2254.56,5.039,great thank you and i'm going to turn my
2257.119,6.401,camera back on now
2259.599,6.0,so first question is for kate so what
2263.52,6.559,our audience is interested in knowing is
2265.599,7.281,if esri if the esri network route only
2270.079,5.681,only a lot does the esri network route
2272.88,6.08,only along segments that have sidewalks
2275.76,4.48,there we go i can read now
2278.96,3.04,so the
2280.24,4.96,the network that i was using was the
2282.0,3.92,built-in arcgis online option
2285.2,2.24,so
2285.92,4.0,that one does not
2287.44,5.2,put an emphasis on sidewalks but the
2289.92,4.72,power of the network analysis data set
2292.64,3.52,or the network analysis tools
2294.64,3.439,is that you can also bring your own
2296.16,4.4,network data sets to them so if you had
2298.079,5.76,a sidewalk network you could load that
2300.56,5.84,in and do the analysis on your specific
2303.839,4.161,sidewalk layer or if you had your own
2306.4,3.679,road network maybe for a country where
2308.0,3.92,the arcgis online
2310.079,4.161,data isn't available you can bring in
2311.92,5.28,your own data to run the same kinds of
2314.24,2.96,analysis on it
2321.92,4.12,no well i think you're muted
2326.4,4.719,that's embarrassing
2328.8,2.319,okay
2331.28,3.12,i need to give it a minute
2335.04,4.72,there we go okay sorry about that so
2337.52,4.319,linda next question is for you is there
2339.76,5.2,a free version of arcgis pro for
2341.839,4.561,students or is there a package with
2344.96,4.0,student pricing
2346.4,5.36,yeah yeah great question um what i would
2348.96,6.72,say is uh check with your university um
2351.76,6.64,many universities have site licenses and
2355.68,4.56,accessible licenses for students
2358.4,3.52,of course you can ask one of us too so
2360.24,3.2,if you'd like you know us to check in
2361.92,3.6,let us know what university you're with
2363.44,4.48,we can we can let you know that
2365.52,5.04,there's also other ways to get access to
2367.92,3.919,the technology personal use license
2370.56,2.96,perhaps
2371.839,3.441,so yeah
2373.52,4.079,reach out we can help you find that
2375.28,2.319,answer
2378.4,6.32,and rami this one is for you
2380.96,5.92,is it possible to show how you imported
2384.72,4.48,the iom drone
2386.88,4.32,images into arcgis pro into the arcgis
2389.2,4.879,pro environment
2391.2,6.08,uh i can share my screen but i can tell
2394.079,6.161,it it's pretty easy so and if you find
2397.28,4.96,the iom images which you search refugee
2400.24,4.72,if you do research on google refugees
2402.24,4.879,iom and arcgis you'll find one of their
2404.96,4.72,web apps and in their web app there
2407.119,4.96,you'll get the link for the layers and
2409.68,5.28,if you click the layers you can show
2412.079,5.201,details or show item details and the
2414.96,4.48,item detail will take you to the service
2417.28,5.2,that service you only need to copy the
2419.44,5.76,link and go to arcgis pro add data from
2422.48,6.32,url and you'll paste that url there and
2425.2,5.2,the image is in your jazz pro
2428.8,3.84,perfect and i think this is a good time
2430.4,4.16,to remind everyone that we are recording
2432.64,4.0,today's session you will have access to
2434.56,3.12,this recording tomorrow so you can
2436.64,3.199,always
2437.68,5.28,replay that response if you need that
2439.839,5.441,step-by-step walk through
2442.96,4.72,and actually rami this next question is
2445.28,2.4,for you
2447.76,4.24,the details of the analysis
2449.76,4.0,blew by in seconds it would be most
2452.0,3.92,helpful to be provided the actual
2453.76,4.8,notebooks and models to poke around and
2455.92,4.32,review how the numbers are generated is
2458.56,3.759,that possible
2460.24,4.72,it is certainly possible and the
2462.319,4.881,resources that linda shared we have the
2464.96,4.24,different models that we use along with
2467.2,4.56,the arcgis pro packages
2469.2,5.919,and along with the deep learning package
2471.76,5.52,that is out there so you can re-create
2475.119,4.561,this analysis on any other different
2477.28,3.2,area and also feel free to reach out to
2479.68,2.48,us
2480.48,3.359,in case you
2482.16,4.24,had any road bumps and we're more than
2483.839,5.041,happy to help you
2486.4,4.8,yeah and i'll just add i've dropped a
2488.88,4.8,couple extra links in the
2491.2,4.32,chat here in the go to meeting so
2493.68,4.24,there's really good documentation for
2495.52,4.559,all of the tools that we used or that
2497.92,4.64,especially i was showing in pro that go
2500.079,4.24,into what are the defaults
2502.56,3.36,if you just leave all the defaults what
2504.319,3.28,are those values and how do they come up
2505.92,2.96,with those
2507.599,3.201,so there's a lot of good information
2508.88,4.64,there on what goes into those analysis
2510.8,2.72,in the background
2514.24,5.119,i have a question for you kate can i use
2517.44,4.919,network analysis tools with
2519.359,3.0,openstreetmap
2522.56,4.64,yeah so there's open street map
2524.8,4.08,um data sets like network data sets that
2527.2,3.44,you can download and then bring directly
2528.88,3.52,into the tool so that's another really
2530.64,3.52,powerful option to use in the network
2532.4,4.0,analysis
2534.16,5.36,data or tool set
2536.4,6.24,also to add on what k said so in the
2539.52,6.0,rohingya refugee tent example we
2542.64,5.12,actually got the raw roads from osm and
2545.52,5.599,we were able to create our network data
2547.76,4.8,set from osm data
2551.119,4.161,excellent
2552.56,5.84,and rami where did you get the estimated
2555.28,5.76,density for rohingya
2558.4,6.719,this is available in a story map shared
2561.04,6.319,by unhcr for the rohingya camp refugee
2565.119,3.681,accounts they estimate per cap how many
2567.359,3.681,people are living
2568.8,5.6,and also on human data exchange there is
2571.04,4.799,some estimates for the camps
2574.4,2.8,excellent
2575.839,3.601,and kate
2577.2,5.76,how can i see what population data is
2579.44,5.36,available for analysis
2582.96,4.48,so a great place to start is the living
2584.8,5.2,atlas that's where i found the esri
2587.44,4.24,world population estimate data set
2590.0,3.52,and there's a lot of other data sets
2591.68,3.919,available through the living atlas both
2593.52,4.4,that have been created by esri and that
2595.599,4.561,have been uh shared by others
2597.92,4.32,uh the esri data when you select it in
2600.16,4.64,the living atlas you'll see a really
2602.24,4.24,detailed explanation of the methodology
2604.8,2.96,of how we came to those population
2606.48,2.879,estimates
2607.76,2.96,and there are also blog posts that go
2609.359,2.401,along with those
2610.72,2.48,to
2611.76,3.44,really go into the details of the
2613.2,3.44,analysis that got us to those population
2615.2,3.44,estimates
2616.64,3.76,yeah i might i might add just to what
2618.64,3.52,kate said um
2620.4,4.32,there there are a ton of really great
2622.16,5.04,resources that we publish and and some
2624.72,5.28,commercial providers that provide data
2627.2,4.639,but um look for your own country data as
2630.0,4.0,well right we're starting to see um
2631.839,4.24,really great sharing of data from
2634.0,4.48,authoritative data sources such as enegy
2636.079,4.401,in mexico and others so
2638.48,3.599,you know it's worth to take a little bit
2640.48,4.639,of time and look around and see what you
2642.079,3.04,could possibly leverage
2645.28,5.44,excellent
2646.72,4.0,and one last question for you oh
2650.96,2.96,actually there's a couple of questions
2652.4,2.24,that came in so i mean this one's for
2653.92,3.28,you
2654.64,6.16,um can you share the training data for
2657.2,7.04,the refugee project or or is there a new
2660.8,3.44,model as a result of this
2664.319,4.721,the model is actually the one you're
2666.24,4.8,seeing on the screen shared which is
2669.04,3.84,refugee tense detect deep learning
2671.04,5.279,package i actually shared that it's
2672.88,6.56,available public for you to download so
2676.319,5.841,i can share the data but it's around one
2679.44,4.8,two tera gigabytes of data
2682.16,3.84,they're already in the model so in case
2684.24,6.52,there is need for that i can even share
2686.0,4.76,the service that is out there
2691.359,2.321,and
2696.079,5.681,so rami this one's for you
2698.8,5.76,do you upload your projects and codes in
2701.76,5.599,the esri official github page or your
2704.56,5.92,personal github pages
2707.359,4.48,unfortunately this code isn't on
2710.48,3.92,github
2711.839,4.561,but there is an effort to get these onto
2714.4,4.64,github pages where we share them with
2716.4,4.8,public for now what we uploaded is
2719.04,4.64,packages arcgis pro packages where you
2721.2,4.72,can find the tool sets and arcgis online
2723.68,5.04,and they're available public so you just
2725.92,2.8,need to download
2729.599,4.961,and kate this one's for you when someone
2732.4,5.04,uses network analysis sometimes the
2734.56,5.279,roads are generated where okay hang on
2737.44,5.2,let me read that one more time
2739.839,5.121,the text is so small i'm sorry everyone
2742.64,4.64,when i used the network analysis
2744.96,4.48,sometimes the roads i generated were in
2747.28,4.24,the beach or the ocean how can i solve
2749.44,3.36,that
2751.52,3.839,so we would need to know a little bit
2752.8,4.0,more about the input data
2755.359,2.801,and the
2756.8,3.92,specific
2758.16,5.84,workflow to know for sure
2760.72,4.48,but you can clip your output by if you
2764.0,2.48,have a
2765.2,2.72,um
2766.48,2.639,if you have like a polygon that's the
2767.92,3.36,extent of the area that you're
2769.119,4.401,interested in
2771.28,4.079,um that would be my first my first
2773.52,3.44,troubleshooting step but yeah i would
2775.359,4.161,really need to know what the input data
2776.96,5.68,is and what the workflow is to
2779.52,3.12,give a better answer there
2783.92,2.88,excellent thank you
2787.599,6.881,so with that linda it looks like our q a
2792.48,3.04,is complete we don't have anything else
2794.48,3.599,coming in
2795.52,3.599,great great set of questions again thank
2798.079,4.081,you all

2807.76,2.8,and encourage you to go take a look at
2809.68,2.72,those
2810.56,4.799,some really great models for you to
2812.4,5.52,leverage in your work and again we
2815.359,3.601,appreciate all of you being here with us
2817.92,3.76,today

2829.839,3.361,license
2831.28,4.4,in that case again i would encourage you
2833.2,4.639,to look at perhaps a personal use
2835.68,4.8,license um
