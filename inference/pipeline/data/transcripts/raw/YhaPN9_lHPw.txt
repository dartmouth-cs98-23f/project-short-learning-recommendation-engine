0.12,3.96,these are some programming related jobs
2.159,3.361,and here are some programming languages
4.08,3.359,which language should a beginner learn
5.52,3.92,for each of these jobs if you can't
7.439,4.2,answer this question this video is for
9.44,4.04,you you see every year we are bombarded
11.639,3.521,with countless videos about top five
13.48,3.2,programming languages to learn but
15.16,3.32,choosing a programming language solely
16.68,3.679,based on what's popular is like blindly
18.48,3.84,picking a path without knowing where it
20.359,3.881,leads you might eventually reach your
22.32,3.52,goals but it would take you much longer
24.24,3.52,than if you took the right path from the
25.84,3.199,beginning in the same way picking a
27.76,2.519,programming language based on your
29.039,3.56,interest and career goals goals will
30.279,3.481,help you reach them much faster today I
32.599,2.521,want to tell you which programming
33.76,3.56,language should you learn based on the
35.12,4.2,job you want let's start with game
37.32,3.64,development there are two popular game
39.32,4.32,engines used in the game development
40.96,4.36,industry Unreal Engine and unity if you
43.64,3.96,have ever played fortnite it was
45.32,4.64,developed using Unreal Engine Pok√©mon go
47.6,4.08,which was all the rage in 2016 was made
49.96,3.56,using Unity if you want to do game
51.68,4.64,development using Unreal Engine you'll
53.52,5.44,need to learn C++ for Unity you'll have
56.32,3.84,to learn C C++ is a general purpose
58.96,2.84,programming language that that was
60.16,4.319,developed as an extension of the C
61.8,4.999,programming language hence the name C++
64.479,4.0,which in programming is equal to c+1
66.799,3.561,which signifies an improvement in C
68.479,3.161,language it was designed to provide a
70.36,3.04,higher level abstraction for
71.64,3.68,object-oriented programming while
73.4,4.68,retaining the efficiency and low-level
75.32,4.72,performance of c and this makes C++ very
78.08,4.12,fast and a perfect candidate for graphic
80.04,4.119,heavy applications like game development
82.2,4.4,C on the other hand was developed by
84.159,5.081,Microsoft in the early 2000s original
86.6,5.479,name of C was cool which is sh for SE
89.24,5.64,like object oriented language so C also
92.079,5.121,has its origin in C C was developed by
94.88,4.96,Microsoft as a competitor to Java so the
97.2,4.76,syntax of C is very similar to Java
99.84,3.84,let's move on to mobile development
101.96,3.479,there are two ways of developing mobile
103.68,3.92,apps native development and
105.439,4.201,crossplatform development when you build
107.6,4.0,apps for a specific operating system
109.64,3.68,it's called native mobile development
111.6,4.0,for example you can do Android
113.32,4.479,development for Android phones and iOS
115.6,4.24,development for iPhones but as you can
117.799,3.801,imagine developing separate apps for
119.84,3.639,different platforms means more work and
121.6,3.6,can be very expensive you'll have to
123.479,3.161,hire Android developers and iOS
125.2,3.16,developers to build and support
126.64,3.44,different versions of your app that's
128.36,2.959,why we have a second way of developing
130.08,3.0,mobile apps which is called
131.319,3.92,crossplatform development in
133.08,4.439,crossplatform development we write code
135.239,4.321,once and it works for both Android and
137.519,3.961,iOS let's talk about the languages you
139.56,3.44,need to learn for Native development
141.48,3.119,cotlin was announced as preferred
143.0,4.72,language for Android development by
144.599,4.681,Google in 2019 before that Java was the
147.72,3.519,most used language for Android
149.28,4.4,development cotlin was created as an
151.239,4.121,improvement over java syntax of cotlin
153.68,3.44,is very similar to Java one of the
155.36,3.599,standout features of cotlin is its
157.12,3.64,built-in null safety nullable and
158.959,3.601,non-nullable types are distinguished in
160.76,3.6,the type system which helps eliminate
162.56,3.56,null pointer exceptions which is a very
164.36,3.959,common cause of bugs in many programming
166.12,3.88,languages cotlin is fully interoperable
168.319,3.881,with Java which means that it can be
170.0,4.959,seamlessly used alongside existing Java
172.2,5.0,code bases for iOS development Swift is
174.959,4.36,the language of choice Swift was created
177.2,5.039,by Apple specifically to build apps for
179.319,5.161,iOS before Swift Objective C was used
182.239,4.28,for iOS development but since Objective
184.48,4.0,C is a language from 80s it lacked
186.519,3.64,several modern features so Apple
188.48,3.96,developed Swift for better performance
190.159,4.281,and interoperability with Objective C
192.44,3.719,moving on to crossplatform development
194.44,3.719,there are two main Frameworks to discuss
196.159,3.961,here first one is react native which was
198.159,4.08,developed by Facebook and the second one
200.12,3.92,is flutter which was developed by Google
202.239,3.56,react native allows developers to build
204.04,4.08,mobile apps using react which is a very
205.799,4.0,popular JavaScript library JavaScript is
208.12,3.52,a high level interpreted programming
209.799,3.921,language primarily used for developing
211.64,4.0,web apps we will discuss react and
213.72,3.599,JavaScript in detail when we cover web
215.64,3.76,development flutter on the other hand
217.319,4.321,uses do as the programming language
219.4,4.32,unlike JavaScript dot is a compiled
221.64,4.08,language dot offers features like just
223.72,4.12,in time compiler for development and
225.72,4.04,ahead of time compiler for release this
227.84,4.119,enables fast execution of flutter
229.76,3.679,applications let's switch gears and talk
231.959,3.401,about artificial intelligence and
233.439,4.64,machine learning after the release of
235.36,4.92,chat GPT last year AI is all the race
238.079,5.0,right now for AI python is the
240.28,4.679,Undisputed Top Choice like JavaScript
243.079,3.921,python is also a high level interpreted
244.959,4.081,language pandas and napai are the two
247.0,4.48,most important python libraries for data
249.04,3.919,manipulation and Analysis psyit learn is
251.48,3.399,the library that provides various
252.959,3.56,machine learning algorithms if you're
254.879,3.521,interested in deep learning you would
256.519,4.161,want to learn tensorflow pytorch or
258.4,3.679,Caris moving on let's talk about one of
260.68,3.56,the most popular domains among
262.079,4.12,programmers which is web development web
264.24,3.6,development has two main components
266.199,3.56,front-end development and backend
267.84,3.96,development to understand what each of
269.759,4.0,these means let's take the example of a
271.8,4.28,login page when you enter your username
273.759,3.841,and password in these text input boxes
276.08,3.52,all of that is happening in the front
277.6,4.24,end of the website after you hit the
279.6,4.439,login button a request is sent via the
281.84,4.04,Internet to a server somewhere far away
284.039,3.961,this server can talk to a database that
285.88,3.879,stores all the passwords safely This
288.0,3.88,Server retrieves the password from the
289.759,3.601,database using the username you provided
291.88,3.4,Compares this password with what you
293.36,3.679,entered in the front end and decides
295.28,3.479,whether to let you log in or not the
297.039,4.401,server and the database are the back end
298.759,4.28,of this website HTML CSS and JavaScript
301.44,4.08,are the building blocks of front end
303.039,4.241,development on the login page HTML
305.52,4.2,decides that there is a login button
307.28,4.479,here CSS decides that the button is blue
309.72,3.919,in color and JavaScript decides what
311.759,4.401,happens when you click this button along
313.639,4.12,with HTML CSS and JavaScript you might
316.16,3.879,also want to learn react which is a
317.759,4.121,popular JavaScript library or angular
320.039,3.521,which is a typescript based framework
321.88,3.8,typescript is a statically typed
323.56,3.72,variation of JavaScript for backend
325.68,3.519,development you have many different
327.28,4.0,options you can use JavaScript with the
329.199,4.161,help of of nodejs you would typically
331.28,4.08,learn a JavaScript library like Express
333.36,4.36,for backend another option you have is
335.36,4.76,to use Python with Django or flask you
337.72,4.52,can also use Java with spring boot PHP
340.12,4.28,with laravel is another option in other
342.24,4.04,words there are many options here if I
344.4,3.519,was picking a programming language here
346.28,3.639,I would pick JavaScript because you can
347.919,3.801,use it in both front end and back end
349.919,3.441,for querying the database you would also
351.72,4.28,want to learn structured query language
353.36,4.72,or SQL moving on if you want to work in
356.0,3.44,embedded systems or operating systems
358.08,3.44,you need to learn a programming language
359.44,3.84,language that has lowlevel capabilities
361.52,3.56,in particular you need a language that
363.28,4.0,can manually manage memory there are
365.08,3.88,three main options here C which is
367.28,4.0,basically the mother of most modern
368.96,4.16,programming languages C is a procedural
371.28,4.199,language that provides no support for
373.12,4.96,objects and classes next option we have
375.479,4.641,is C++ which as discussed earlier is an
378.08,3.76,objectoriented programming language that
380.12,4.24,provides ability to manage memory with
381.84,4.04,the help of pointers last option is rust
384.36,3.6,which is relatively newer among the
385.88,3.84,three options rust achiev safety and
387.96,3.92,memory management through its own ship
389.72,3.879,and borrowing system rust is constantly
391.88,5.28,ranked among the most loved programming
393.599,5.401,languages in recent times devops is next
397.16,3.68,for those who don't know devops
399.0,4.24,Engineers enable an organization to
400.84,4.12,deliver applications and services fast
403.24,3.959,python is a popular scripting language
404.96,3.639,among devops Engineers golang is another
407.199,3.681,language that's gaining massive
408.599,3.961,popularity in devops space other than
410.88,4.159,that you would also need to know bash
412.56,4.96,scripting let's quickly talk about arvr
415.039,4.88,now ever since Apple launched Vision Pro
417.52,4.2,this area is heating up to develop arvr
419.919,3.921,experiences for Apple you'll have to
421.72,4.159,learn Swift UI we still need to see how
423.84,3.359,the launch of Apple Vision Pro plays out
425.879,3.241,so if you want to pick a language based
427.199,4.881,on the current reality of the market I
429.12,4.799,would pick C++ or C that's because vast
432.08,4.48,majority of developers use unity and
433.919,4.56,Unreal Engine for arvr development let's
436.56,3.16,talk about blockchain development now
438.479,3.481,though the interest in blockchain
439.72,4.12,development has reduced recently I don't
441.96,4.28,see why it would not pick back up once
443.84,3.84,the market improves solidity is the most
446.24,3.679,popular programming language among
447.68,3.88,blockchain developers solidity is a high
449.919,3.481,level programming language specifically
451.56,4.12,designed for developing smart contracts
453.4,4.68,on blockchain platforms like ethereum in
455.68,4.079,terms of syntax solidity is similar to
458.08,3.16,JavaScript I know that picking a
459.759,3.28,programming language from all these
461.24,3.6,different options is very hard if you
463.039,4.28,want to know three languages I recommend
464.84,4.359,and how to learn them watch this video
467.319,4.121,my name is sahil and I'll see you in the
469.199,2.241,next
471.479,3.0,one
