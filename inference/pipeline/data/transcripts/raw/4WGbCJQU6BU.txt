second,duration,transcript
1.199,5.35,speaking of markets a lot of fascinating
4.029,5.341,aspects of this world arise not from
6.549,5.731,individual humans but from the
9.37,5.37,interaction of human beings you've done
12.28,5.37,a lot of work in game theory first can
14.74,5.64,you say what is game theory and how does
17.65,5.28,help us model and study yeah game theory
20.38,4.98,of course let us give credit where it's
22.93,4.98,due they don't comes from the economist
25.36,4.77,first and foremost but as I'd mentioned
27.91,5.219,before like you know computer scientists
30.13,4.79,never hesitate to wander into other
33.129,4.5,people's turf and so there is now this
34.92,4.72,20 year old field called algorithmic
37.629,5.601,game theory but you know game game
39.64,5.91,theory first and foremost is a
43.23,6.19,mathematical framework for reasoning
45.55,7.169,about collective outcomes in systems of
49.42,6.18,interacting individuals you know so you
52.719,5.64,need at least two people to get started
55.6,4.11,in game theory and many people are
58.359,3.87,probably familiar with prisoner's
59.71,4.67,dilemma as kind of a classic example of
62.229,5.251,game theory and a classic example where
64.38,5.08,everybody looking out for their own
67.48,4.02,individual interests leads to a
69.46,4.86,collective outcome that's kind of worse
71.5,4.74,for everybody then what might be
74.32,4.68,possible if they cooperate it for
76.24,6.26,example but cooperation is not an
79.0,6.09,equilibrium in prisoner's dilemma and so
82.5,4.66,my work and the field of algorithmic
85.09,6.54,game theory more generally in these
87.16,7.71,areas kind of looks at settings in which
91.63,6.09,the number of actors is potentially
94.87,5.13,extraordinarily large and their
97.72,5.58,incentives might be quite complicated
100.0,5.25,and kind of hard to model directly but
103.3,4.26,you still want kind of algorithmic ways
105.25,4.08,of kind of predicting what will happen
107.56,6.06,or influencing what will happen in the
109.33,7.08,design of platforms so what to you is
113.62,6.12,the most beautiful idea that you've
116.41,5.6,encountered in game theory there's a lot
119.74,5.43,of them I'm a big fan of the field I
122.01,5.98,mean you know I mean technical answers
125.17,5.549,to that of course would include Nash's
127.99,4.38,work just establishing that you know
130.719,4.1,there there's a competitive equilibrium
132.37,5.36,under very very general circumstance
134.819,6.9,which in many ways kind of put the field
137.73,5.489,on a firm conceptual footing because if
141.719,3.42,you don't have equilibria it's kind of
143.219,3.75,hard to ever reason about what might
145.139,4.11,happen since you know there's just no
146.969,4.38,stability so just the idea that
149.249,3.841,stability can emerge when there's
151.349,3.301,multiple who or that it means not that
153.09,3.149,it will necessarily emerge just that
154.65,3.33,it's possible right it's like the
156.239,4.62,existence of equilibrium doesn't mean
157.98,5.189,that sort of natural iterative behavior
160.859,4.71,will necessarily lead to it in the real
163.169,3.811,world yeah maybe answering a slightly
165.569,3.12,less personally than you asked the
166.98,4.229,question I think within the field of
168.689,7.101,algorithmic game theory perhaps the
171.209,6.45,single most important kind of technical
175.79,4.0,contribution that's been made is the
177.659,4.771,real the the realization between close
179.79,4.05,connections between machine learning and
182.43,3.66,game theory and in particular between
183.84,3.69,game theory and the branch of machine
186.09,4.259,learning that's known as no regret
187.53,5.459,learning and and this sort of provides a
190.349,6.03,freight a very general framework in
192.989,6.42,which a bunch of players interacting in
196.379,4.591,a game or a system each one kind of
199.409,3.51,doing something that's in their
200.97,4.229,self-interest will actually kind of
202.919,4.88,reach an equilibrium and actually reach
205.199,6.271,an equilibrium in a you know a pretty
207.799,7.631,you know a rather you know short amount
211.47,8.489,of steps so you kind of mentioned acting
215.43,8.459,greedily can somehow end up pretty good
219.959,7.77,for everybody or pretty bad or pretty
223.889,6.69,bad it will end up stable yeah right and
227.729,5.641,you know stability or equilibrium by
230.579,4.891,itself is not that is not necessarily
233.37,3.42,either a good thing or a bad thing so
235.47,3.299,what's the connection between machine
236.79,4.02,learning and the ideas well if we kind
238.769,4.8,of talked about these ideas already in
240.81,5.159,in kind of a non-technical way which is
243.569,4.771,maybe the more interesting way of
245.969,6.961,understanding them first which is you
248.34,7.53,know we have many systems platforms and
252.93,5.19,apps these days that work really hard to
255.87,5.76,use our data and the data of everybody
258.12,6.9,else on the platform to selfishly
261.63,5.64,optimize on behalf of each user okay so
265.02,3.51,you know let me let me give what the
267.27,3.57,cleanest example
268.53,4.58,which is just driving apps navigation
270.84,5.58,apps like you know Google Maps and ways
273.11,5.95,where you know miraculously compared to
276.42,4.26,when I was growing up at least you know
279.06,3.3,the objective would be the same when you
280.68,3.93,wanted to drive from point A to point B
282.36,4.53,spend the least time driving not
284.61,4.5,necessarily minimize the distance but
286.89,4.44,minimize the time right and when I was
289.11,4.23,growing up like the only resources you
291.33,3.9,had to do that were like maps in the car
293.34,4.77,which literally just told you what roads
295.23,6.24,were available and then you might have
298.11,5.13,like half hourly traffic reports just
301.47,3.42,about the major freeways but not about
303.24,4.65,side roads so you were pretty much on
304.89,4.44,your own and now we've got these apps
307.89,3.9,you pull it out and you say I want to go
309.33,4.83,from point A to point B and in response
311.79,4.29,kind of to what everybody else is doing
314.16,4.71,if you like what all the other players
316.08,4.77,in this game are doing right now here's
318.87,4.23,the the you know the the route that
320.85,5.19,minimizes your driving time so it is
323.1,5.79,really kind of computing a selfish best
326.04,4.83,response for each of us in response to
328.89,4.92,what all of the rest of us are doing at
330.87,5.1,any given moment and so you know I think
333.81,6.54,it's quite fair to think of these apps
335.97,7.11,as driving or nudging us all towards the
340.35,5.97,competitive or Nash equilibrium of that
343.08,4.589,game now you might ask like well that
346.32,5.28,sounds great why is that a bad thing
347.669,7.861,well you know it's it's known both in
351.6,9.81,theory and with some limited studies
355.53,7.5,from actual like traffic data that all
361.41,3.54,of us being in this competitive
363.03,4.32,equilibrium might cause our collective
364.95,4.77,driving time to be higher may be
367.35,4.92,significantly higher than it would be
369.72,4.17,under other solutions and then you have
372.27,4.47,to talk about what those other solutions
373.89,4.38,might be and what what the algorithms to
376.74,3.179,implement them are which we do discuss
378.27,5.16,in the kind of game theory chapter of
379.919,7.171,the book but but similarly you know on
383.43,6.12,social media platforms or on Amazon you
387.09,4.26,know all these algorithms that are
389.55,4.17,essentially trying to optimize our
391.35,4.2,behalf they're driving us in a
393.72,4.17,colloquial sense towards some kind of
395.55,3.96,competitive equilibrium and you know one
397.89,3.12,of the most important lessons of game
399.51,2.79,theory is that just because we're at
401.01,3.689,equilibrium doesn't mean that
402.3,4.64,there's not a solution in which some or
404.699,4.261,maybe even all of us might be better off
406.94,3.789,and then the connection to machine
408.96,3.739,learning of course is that in all these
410.729,3.87,platforms I've mentioned the
412.699,3.97,optimization that they're doing on our
414.599,3.63,behalf is driven by machine learning you
416.669,3.541,know like predicting where the traffic
418.229,3.601,will be predicting what products I'm
420.21,4.4,gonna like predicting what would make me
421.83,2.78,happy in my newsfeed
430.74,2.06,you
