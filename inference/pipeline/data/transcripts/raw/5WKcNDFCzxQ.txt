second,duration,transcript
0.16,5.36,last session so we have had a wonderful
3.52,5.28,or two days already this is our last
5.52,4.079,session we usually say best for the last
8.8,3.12,so
9.599,5.441,our first speaker for this afternoon
11.92,5.359,session is professor yajin wong from
15.04,5.2,the study department at the university
17.279,5.441,of wisconsin medicine and yazon was also
20.24,3.36,peter's student so but i i don't know
22.72,2.96,young
23.6,4.32,young number you know a long time still
25.68,4.48,that is yeah and yeah he's also
27.92,5.36,currently the department chair at the
30.16,6.8,university of wisconsin at medicine so
33.28,3.68,yeah john flores yours thank you
38.16,6.399,well thanks hiya for the introduction uh
41.36,5.84,according to the uh the student the
44.559,4.241,peter lisa on his web page i'm the
47.2,3.199,number 39
48.8,3.599,and so it's
50.399,4.241,that's the sources i know there's some
52.399,4.8,kind of ambiguity or the missing data
54.64,5.52,but that my source is from the hidden
57.199,6.16,webpage so i'd like to thank peter for
60.16,6.72,the uh uh many years inspiration and
63.359,6.641,help and support and uh to my uh career
66.88,5.2,and thanks peter happy birthday
70.0,4.56,and i also like to thank the uh
72.08,4.88,organizer for uh putting together this
74.56,6.32,conference and uh for inviting me for
76.96,6.64,this opportunity to give a talk and uh
80.88,5.599,uh another things i like that you think
83.6,5.44,is the simon institute and they
86.479,5.521,organized the institute institute
89.04,5.2,organized many quantum computing
92.0,6.24,programs over the year
94.24,4.0,i participated many
98.479,5.761,in person before the pandemic and uh
101.6,4.559,even more during the pandemic uh field
104.24,4.32,of zoom and i feel is the kind of
106.159,4.561,wonderful benefit maybe for the coving i
108.56,4.879,can kind of move freely to attend those
110.72,5.28,uh those uh quantum computing uh
113.439,2.561,programs
116.159,4.96,so i will uh
118.32,6.0,for this today's audience i feel is for
121.119,5.761,the statistics audience and i will i
124.32,5.52,know the the barrier about the quantum
126.88,6.56,computation and the concept i will try
129.84,6.64,to use a minimal introduction of quantum
133.44,6.08,computations to illustrate my point
136.48,5.36,uh i i will keep like the focus at about
139.52,5.12,my pocket at high level for the simple
141.84,5.759,cases so that we can better understand
144.64,6.56,uh understand the uh uh the things from
147.599,3.601,the statistics aspects
151.44,5.36,now uh what's the uh like first let's
154.8,3.439,talk about the quantum advantage or the
156.8,2.88,quantum uh
158.239,4.08,supremacies
159.68,6.16,uh the way we think of like when you
162.319,6.081,compare quantum uh device combination
165.84,6.24,device usually you do a theoretical
168.4,6.88,proof okay on the theory another one is
172.08,6.4,to build up device for the experimental
175.28,6.0,demonstration okay now for quantum cases
178.48,4.16,over the years there's a lot of like a
181.28,5.36,theoretical
182.64,6.48,study proposing uh quantum algorithms
186.64,5.599,and actually you can prove uh there are
189.12,5.36,many quantum algorithms which can be uh
192.239,5.041,much faster than the classical
194.48,4.96,algorithms like a well-known like for
197.28,3.599,example shorts are factoring large
199.44,4.4,numbers and
200.879,7.041,the algorithms which has been proving uh
203.84,7.2,to be exponentially fast than the best
207.92,6.0,known classical algorithm okay
211.04,5.759,also the groove uh search algorithms
213.92,6.56,which you can uh have been showed is uh
216.799,5.921,quadrotically fast to the best proofed
220.48,4.08,aggregate classical algorithms and
222.72,4.0,actually the quadrotic fast is the
224.56,3.759,optimal and that so basically it has
226.72,3.599,been optimal in the quantum sense
228.319,4.721,opening in a classical sense and you can
230.319,6.56,compare to still have a quadruple speed
233.04,6.88,up now we have all of those theories uh
236.879,5.28,method algorithm proved in based on
239.92,4.319,quantum theory now
242.159,4.321,well we demonstrated can we demonstrate
244.239,6.161,that one so we needed to build up a
246.48,6.72,device try to run these algorithms to
250.4,6.64,actually see what happened and there so
253.2,6.319,in principle we could do is try to
257.04,6.24,fight build up a device
259.519,5.761,try to uh compete against the best super
263.28,5.28,computer i need to see what happened
265.28,5.52,there okay now unfortunately uh uh
268.56,5.84,because of the technology difficulty
270.8,8.0,what we can uh created are the quantum
274.4,7.68,computers uh a much smaller uh scale and
278.8,6.399,which cannot run those uh kind of like a
282.08,5.76,theoretically proving uh algorithms and
285.199,3.44,to show those quantum advantage
287.84,4.24,so
288.639,6.401,the way is can we based on what we have
292.08,5.119,do something completed with the best i
295.04,5.2,like that super computer which is the
297.199,6.241,similar to like we show like the apple
300.24,5.28,cars against the laptop and you try to
303.44,4.479,find out some algorithms uh some
305.52,5.44,computational problems you run on both
307.919,4.881,to see what happens okay now uh for the
310.96,3.679,case for the cases the fundamental
312.8,4.16,computing cases against the best
314.639,4.721,supercomputer it's basically pretty much
316.96,5.92,the same of this comparison it's just to
319.36,6.48,try to uh find out suitable problems uh
322.88,4.879,to demonstrate uh some of the things and
325.84,3.199,you may have heard about it that like
327.759,3.041,the recent
329.039,2.961,landmark
330.8,4.0,project
332.0,4.16,demonstrating quantum supremacies
334.8,4.56,basically saying
336.16,5.84,take 200 seconds computational job for
339.36,6.64,the fundamental computer and that one
342.0,7.44,would take 10 000 years or 0.6 billion
346.0,6.24,years uh for this best super computer at
349.44,4.64,that time and you finished at the 200 uh
352.24,3.519,200 second job and the fundamental
354.08,4.72,computer did
355.759,5.44,so the two uh project one is the google
358.8,5.2,and the publishing nature uh it's
361.199,6.241,basically they find out uh
364.0,5.36,so-called uh random quantum circuits
367.44,4.4,what's that one it is a statistic
369.36,4.559,assembly problem which i will illustrate
371.84,3.919,and at the moment and basically show
373.919,3.601,that one at that time the best
375.759,3.521,fundamental computer as best the
377.52,3.92,classical super computer would take it
379.28,3.759,ten thousand years and the second
381.44,2.4,project that we
383.039,4.801,is
383.84,7.84,published in the science uh 2020s by a
387.84,6.88,ustc china and uh project the base build
391.68,5.6,up another quantum computer and
394.72,5.36,again a statistic example sampling
397.28,4.8,problems is called both on sampling and
400.08,4.239,they showed for data that that problem
402.08,4.0,it would take the computational uh
404.319,3.44,problem it would take the best of the
406.08,3.28,super computer
407.759,4.241,at that time to
409.36,4.399,take maybe that point six billion years
412.0,2.639,to finish that job
413.759,4.16,so
414.639,7.041,so what i will illustrate in my talk is
417.919,7.041,trying to explain the statistics and uh
421.68,7.44,associated with those projects
424.96,7.28,now uh i have to to say that one is when
429.12,6.56,i refer to classical computer okay and
432.24,6.32,it means what we are currently using a
435.68,4.0,electronic base okay and the second one
438.56,3.52,i like to
439.68,5.12,like it and say that one is although we
442.08,6.64,call it quantum computer like a classic
444.8,6.399,computer both a computer and either
448.72,5.68,you be may not believing that the
451.199,6.321,difference between the quantum computer
454.4,4.72,and the current classical computer is
457.52,4.88,much bigger than
459.12,5.359,that these two like the uh the laptops
462.4,5.359,and accuracy because of the functioning
464.479,3.28,underlying mechanism
468.16,5.599,so let's uh go down to the bottom and
471.039,4.72,see what's the uh quantum computing uh
473.759,4.321,it's basically it's like the classical
475.759,5.12,computing all started with bits like
478.08,5.519,zero and one and in the quantum cases we
480.879,5.361,have a quantum beat and we call it qubit
483.599,5.921,and it's also zero and the one we use
486.24,6.079,this uh cat these kind of like notations
489.52,3.679,uh to to change it in the quantum bit
492.319,3.681,okay
493.199,5.601,now unlike it in the in the in the uh
496.0,6.8,classical cases you only have these two
498.8,6.799,points quantum theory allow us uh qubit
502.8,4.959,in the superposition state is basically
505.599,5.681,you have a different one any linear
507.759,4.321,combination of these is also a state
511.28,3.999,and
512.08,5.519,so that that those two coefficients are
515.279,4.481,amplitude they have these kind of unit
517.599,4.401,normal constraints okay
519.76,4.96,and uh in a moment you will see this
522.0,5.76,will have that probability sticks and uh
524.72,4.96,consequence uh for for for for the uh
527.76,3.28,rental nature of the quantum cubit
529.68,4.56,theory
531.04,6.16,now if you from these superpositions you
534.24,6.719,can see if you identify those two or the
537.2,5.199,base okay so any linear combinations of
540.959,4.081,this one superposition state
542.399,4.801,corresponding a point in the two
545.04,6.0,dimensional space okay
547.2,5.44,so the superpositions is corresponding
551.04,3.6,all of those
552.64,4.08,fields at the point every point
554.64,4.24,corresponding to a state unlike the
556.72,4.48,classic classification they only got a
558.88,6.32,two point is in the classical cases
561.2,6.16,either on or off like a coin like a pro
565.2,4.48,and the cons okay now in the quantum
567.36,4.4,cases you can think about it that coin
569.68,5.76,which have all the state
571.76,6.16,from the pro and anything continues and
575.44,5.76,and of this one so you will see that in
577.92,5.359,the much bigger space okay now because
581.2,4.16,of the superpositions you can think of
583.279,5.521,interpret that one is uh in the
585.36,6.24,classical cases either head or tail okay
588.8,5.28,and uh in that quantum case you can have
591.6,5.6,a both head and tail both zero and one
594.08,4.0,cases continue into the simultaneously
597.2,4.879,now
598.08,6.64,in the classical cases we now it is zero
602.079,5.44,and one and uh
604.72,5.76,you know which state is you always easy
607.519,6.401,to check now in the quantum cases you
610.48,6.16,cannot directly exempt the qubit to find
613.92,5.2,out those coefficients but there is a
616.64,5.6,you can measure that qubit and then
619.12,6.32,there's a stochastic random outcome here
622.24,5.44,so what happens is if you make any
625.44,4.32,measurement of the qubit what you would
627.68,3.279,see it will be collapsed to the two
629.76,4.48,points
630.959,5.761,beta 0 and 1 in the random cases now
634.24,4.48,what's the probability of observation 0
636.72,5.84,is that corresponding coefficient
638.72,5.6,amplitude a modulus square okay and the
642.56,4.08,with 1 is
644.32,4.88,for this coefficient modulus well so
646.64,5.04,that's the constraint of equal to one
649.2,4.8,allow these probability uh
651.68,5.04,interpretations that's well uh the
654.0,4.959,probability uh comes into play in the
656.72,5.04,quantum and in the cubic cases so
658.959,5.361,remember that one is anything you have a
661.76,5.36,qubit you want it it will if you wanted
664.32,4.88,to do measurements and get a result like
667.12,3.68,the like digits and then there's a
669.2,3.84,probability there okay you can think
670.8,4.4,about the probability distribution and
673.04,5.28,because of this one all the quantum
675.2,5.92,computations algorithms and things are
678.32,4.88,random algorithms and the distribution
681.12,4.8,associated with that one okay
683.2,5.52,now moving to the multiple qubits okay
685.92,5.359,and in that two cubic cases you would
688.72,5.84,see there will be four of them zero zero
691.279,6.24,zero one one zero zero one one okay so
694.56,5.6,that any superposition will be
697.519,4.88,linear combination of those four so if
700.16,4.16,you think about those are the bases it
702.399,4.161,occurs the space you need to handle the
704.32,5.12,two grouping it'll be four dimensions if
706.56,4.959,you have three cubits eight animation so
709.44,4.0,uh if you have a vehicle it will be true
711.519,4.081,to the power of b dimension you can see
713.44,4.959,the exponential scale up okay the
715.6,4.56,superposition expansion scale so that's
718.399,5.041,the uh cubic
720.16,5.119,now uh similar to that to the classical
723.44,4.079,computer cases we need to build up a
725.279,4.481,gate circles uh to get make the
727.519,5.521,computation moving so in the quantum
729.76,5.44,cases you can also uh build up the gates
733.04,4.96,and like for example you can change the
735.2,5.36,zero to one one to zero okay but
738.0,4.72,remember we have a superposition okay so
740.56,4.719,the quantum theory is saying that all
742.72,4.88,the cubic degrees are must be unitary
745.279,4.641,the transformation must be unit of any
747.6,4.64,of this one unlike the classic basic it
749.92,4.96,must be unitary and that one is
752.24,4.8,represented by a unitary matrix okay so
754.88,4.079,that any of these you would see uh
757.04,4.0,compare with this one you transform the
758.959,4.56,state and then any supervision will
761.04,4.88,happen same with similar transformations
763.519,5.521,these are unitary matrix so if you think
765.92,5.28,about a gate is a unitary matrix okay
769.04,5.12,now the circuits quantum server it's
771.2,5.759,just connecting a circuit of a gates
774.16,6.32,together quantum gates together okay uh
776.959,5.841,so that one is this circuit is kind of a
780.48,4.4,performing uh if you carry out this
782.8,4.159,circuit and do a bunch of those unit
784.88,4.88,universal information you are performing
786.959,5.201,the certain computational task and that
789.76,4.56,task basically if you you can think
792.16,4.32,about all those connected if each of the
794.32,5.12,gates have a unitary matrix you multiply
796.48,6.24,together so you will have a big unitary
799.44,5.12,matrix for these circuits so in the end
802.72,3.84,you want to see whenever we talk about
804.56,3.92,the circles you can think about a unit
806.56,4.959,or matrix big unit or matrix
808.48,5.2,corresponding to that one okay and
811.519,4.801,so this is the combination now what's
813.68,4.64,the exciting uh oh here is just some
816.32,5.04,pictures illustrated that the cube is
818.32,4.079,here and you can apply the case and you
821.36,3.44,can uh
822.399,5.601,one or two cases and if you carry all of
824.8,5.52,them it corresponds to a quantum circuit
828.0,5.36,now what's exciting about it the quantum
830.32,6.24,computation is the possible
833.36,5.76,speed up of fast algorithm to uh
836.56,4.88,performing certain computational tasks
839.12,4.719,which is due to the many quantum uh
841.44,4.72,property which is in the classical cases
843.839,4.721,we don't have like supervisions
846.16,5.359,entanglements and so on and so forth so
848.56,5.44,if you have any algorithms uh on the on
851.519,4.481,the buildup on the circuits uh carry out
854.0,5.76,that one you'll have under result
856.0,6.24,automation everything is random okay so
859.76,4.96,it's basically it's like the mcmc
862.24,4.8,algorithms your real ones it may give
864.72,5.359,you the correct or incorrect solution
867.04,5.359,okay but there is certain probabilities
870.079,4.56,you will get the correct solution okay
872.399,5.12,so you now you repeat you'll eventually
874.639,5.281,get the correct solutions so that any
877.519,4.88,algorithms correspond the end result
879.92,4.64,will have a probability that the retinal
882.399,4.0,outcome solutions they will be have a
884.56,3.839,distribution associated with that one
886.399,3.281,okay
888.399,3.44,now
889.68,3.92,when we say the compile compare the
891.839,4.321,classical computer and uh and the
893.6,5.2,quantum computer you would see uh what's
896.16,4.08,the against these two it's basically
898.8,3.92,that using
900.24,4.719,you're using the classical computer to
902.72,4.559,solve a class a computational problem if
904.959,5.281,the problem is the same you just use the
907.279,5.92,given device to solve the same problem
910.24,5.12,okay now the classical computer can only
913.199,4.721,run the classical algorithm
915.36,4.96,quantum computer can need to run the
917.92,4.8,quantum algorithm
920.32,4.24,now the speed up of the mission that is
922.72,4.88,the uh the interesting about these
924.56,6.0,things is that potential quantum speed
927.6,6.88,up there are many theoretically proven
930.56,7.04,quantum algorithms which has uh have uh
934.48,5.76,speed up uh over the classical algorithm
937.6,5.28,and i wanted to put that one not always
940.24,4.08,as a matter of fact and the many cases
942.88,3.759,we don't fundamental computers don't
944.32,4.4,have to speed up it's just for certain
946.639,4.161,problems it may have
948.72,5.2,quantum speed up
950.8,5.839,now again what's the issue here
953.92,6.4,is because we don't have the large scale
956.639,7.841,quantum computer to uh render
960.32,6.72,theoretically proven uh algorithms which
964.48,5.84,we can demonstrate the quantum advantage
967.04,5.919,and in the practice what we have is
970.32,5.519,pointed we can build up a strategy with
972.959,5.841,a much smaller quantum computer and
975.839,5.281,which may not be uh imperfect and we
978.8,4.479,refer to the near term quantum computer
981.12,3.279,we still wanted to find out some
983.279,4.081,problems
984.399,4.8,which we will be using
987.36,4.64,calculate like the
989.199,5.681,performing uh on the on the quantum
992.0,5.36,computer against the best supercomputer
994.88,4.879,to solve that kind of problems trying to
997.36,4.88,show there's a quantum advantage an
999.759,6.721,advantage so this is the kind will refer
1002.24,4.24,to quantum supremacy okay
1006.56,7.04,now uh the two uh projects automation
1010.639,6.88,early on are the uh one is google
1013.6,6.32,another one is the uh ustc projects and
1017.519,5.041,google they build up a quantum computer
1019.92,6.48,is based on the super conducting and
1022.56,6.56,qubits with the 53 cubits at that time
1026.4,4.96,and the designer problems is uh either
1029.12,5.04,refer to the random quantum circles and
1031.36,5.76,the statistical sampling problems and
1034.16,5.6,the rent on this uh on this uh this
1037.12,5.12,device and and that you solve that
1039.76,4.72,problems and you will see i would in a
1042.24,4.319,moment i will explain what's the random
1044.48,6.72,quantum surface
1046.559,8.0,and the usgc is based on the uh optic
1051.2,5.599,quantum optic systems uh photons and uh
1054.559,5.921,buildup uh is uh
1056.799,6.401,it's in the 20th 2020s and uh they also
1060.48,5.28,uh solved our sampling problems and i
1063.2,4.24,will explain this one what's that bozon
1065.76,3.919,random sample uh both on sampling
1067.44,4.8,problem there are both are statistical
1069.679,5.441,problems to solve for that one now why
1072.24,5.12,they choose assembling problems uh
1075.12,4.32,automating that one that because of a
1077.36,5.28,limitation the quantum computer so far
1079.44,6.72,we have is relatively small and
1082.64,6.72,it's uh it's noisy and so we needed to
1086.16,6.56,find out the problems are very suitable
1089.36,5.439,for those device okay to to perform but
1092.72,5.04,on the other hand we wanted to use that
1094.799,5.441,problem it's very hard for the super
1097.76,4.799,computer okay to solve so we can
1100.24,4.88,demonstrate advantages so that the two
1102.559,5.041,things so easy relatively easy for the
1105.12,5.6,quantum computer and the very hard for
1107.6,5.6,that uh super computer
1110.72,5.44,now let's let's explain what's the uh
1113.2,5.12,random quantum service and basically
1116.16,5.6,that the google computer we have at that
1118.32,6.32,time have 53 qubits basically you have
1121.76,5.919,all those qubits they apply the gates
1124.64,6.0,okay randomly select those gates apply
1127.679,5.521,on these each of those qubits from a set
1130.64,3.919,of gates apply on the other one and
1133.2,3.76,these stop
1134.559,4.801,the other other single qubit and those
1136.96,4.24,one are the like two cubits basically
1139.36,4.559,you can think about it's kind of like
1141.2,6.24,that uh like it's like the unit of a
1143.919,5.601,matrix multiply on a cubic basis and
1147.44,4.64,they will repeat okay you think about
1149.52,5.92,one round then regular sampling another
1152.08,5.68,round and they're giving the m wrong so
1155.44,5.119,why they do the div even wrong because
1157.76,5.12,they wanted to increase complexity
1160.559,5.201,increase the hardness for the classical
1162.88,6.159,computer to do the sampling okay
1165.76,4.4,now in the end after you apply all those
1169.039,4.241,gates
1170.16,5.68,the quantum circuit that the qubits in
1173.28,5.44,this quantum computer in this
1175.84,4.719,case you make measurements okay you will
1178.72,4.64,get the sum of the each cubic that will
1180.559,5.921,be one zero or one so in the end you
1183.36,6.72,will get like in this case the 53 length
1186.48,5.84,of one zero bit stream okay so that's
1190.08,4.64,supposed to get that that's your data
1192.32,5.2,okay so in this case if you have a b
1194.72,5.92,bits those bit string will be belong to
1197.52,6.96,this space length of a b and zero one
1200.64,6.399,okay now how many number of this one is
1204.48,5.439,two to the power for b so exponential uh
1207.039,4.401,increase you want to see if you make
1209.919,2.961,these these
1211.44,4.88,like the bigger
1212.88,5.039,eventually and make these steps like the
1216.32,4.08,cycles more
1217.919,4.721,eventually you will make it so hard for
1220.4,4.639,the super computer to calculate the
1222.64,4.64,simulated leads okay now for the quantum
1225.039,3.76,computer what you do is you just carry
1227.28,3.84,out this one in the end make a
1228.799,5.441,measurement you will get the data okay
1231.12,6.48,so if it turns out these problems can be
1234.24,6.4,illustrated of the size biased sampling
1237.6,5.76,uh uh approach scheme in that cases it's
1240.64,4.56,just in this probability space okay this
1243.36,3.84,way the probability space do the
1245.2,5.52,sampling now what's the sampling in this
1247.2,5.68,case remember for each realization of
1250.72,4.4,these reynolds you have a circle you can
1252.88,4.88,make measurements there is a probability
1255.12,5.52,distribution over there okay and then
1257.76,6.159,there's another layers of because we
1260.64,5.44,apply those gates random okay so there's
1263.919,4.321,another randomness there the two layers
1266.08,5.04,of retinol means there so it's like it's
1268.24,4.88,like the uh two layers of reynolds so
1271.12,4.0,you you know make that the classical
1273.12,5.52,combination so hard
1275.12,5.84,because of that one so there is idealize
1278.64,5.519,the cases like they can make it argue
1280.96,5.599,that one if that adapts go to infinity
1284.159,5.361,and you will approach it your so-called
1286.559,4.161,the asymptotics is the ideal product
1289.52,4.0,times
1290.72,4.16,distributions in that case now what is
1293.52,4.399,the scheme
1294.88,4.48,you can see this corresponding to if you
1297.919,4.161,trade this
1299.36,6.319,this circuit is corresponding a unitary
1302.08,7.52,matrix on the 2b times the 2b although
1305.679,6.721,the unitary matrix is this one this
1309.6,5.84,idealized as a methodical limit sense
1312.4,5.84,either corresponding to a you if you put
1315.44,5.599,a higher measure on these all of those
1318.24,6.0,unitary matrix and you sample according
1321.039,4.88,to this how measure okay and what what
1324.24,4.64,happened in that one
1325.919,6.161,each fixed sample of the qubits
1328.88,5.84,sorry unitary matrix corresponding one
1332.08,5.44,realization of these qubits you make the
1334.72,5.52,measurements basically that they order
1337.52,5.2,the cubits in those states so if you
1340.24,4.88,make a measurement you observe any of
1342.72,4.959,the bit string in this space it will
1345.12,5.6,correspond in the probability of an
1347.679,6.401,amplitude square automation early on now
1350.72,5.52,differentiated here this amplitude is
1354.08,4.24,also random okay there's another retinal
1356.24,5.12,knee scale so we'll call the random
1358.32,5.68,circuits so this renault knees under the
1361.36,7.36,idealized cases in illustrator at this
1364.0,7.2,point you sample iid from exponential
1368.72,5.68,distribution okay and then they
1371.2,5.28,normalize this one and make this
1374.4,3.36,amplitude square corresponding to this
1376.48,4.88,probability
1377.76,7.12,okay so what happened is that observed
1381.36,6.24,data is the bit stream it's essentially
1384.88,4.72,uh the bit stream uh those bit string
1387.6,4.16,you're observed according to this
1389.6,5.92,probability two layers of probability
1391.76,6.08,scheme and in these cases okay space now
1395.52,4.72,as i mentioned that our cubits are not a
1397.84,4.8,perfect they're the law is still this is
1400.24,4.319,the ideal case you have this probability
1402.64,5.12,distribution of quantities actually
1404.559,5.761,there is added additive noise there so
1407.76,5.919,that in the real cases corresponding
1410.32,6.88,this one the model is this probability
1413.679,7.041,observed those strings is equal to some
1417.2,6.4,epsilon times the idealized probability
1420.72,5.68,plus one minus epsilon and here we put
1423.6,6.959,some noise and this one is the uniform
1426.4,6.72,noise on this space okay so that is this
1430.559,5.201,epsilon is the fidelity basically the
1433.12,4.559,measure uh what's the uh
1435.76,3.6,like closeness of the sampling
1437.679,4.321,distribution with this ideal
1439.36,4.88,distribution or is it how many uh like
1442.0,5.2,the percentage of the data streams are
1444.24,5.76,really from the output distribution from
1447.2,5.2,those uh carried out to the circuit
1450.0,5.039,now if you forget about all those
1452.4,4.8,quantum lists you can summarize in the
1455.039,4.64,idealized case what's the sampling
1457.2,4.719,problem the sampling problem is like a
1459.679,4.48,biased assembly you have this
1461.919,5.201,probability space discrete with the
1464.159,5.441,cardinality of the equal to b okay you
1467.12,5.36,have a sampling scheme the assembling
1469.6,6.16,scheme is basically is all of those bit
1472.48,5.84,string in this space you draw one of
1475.76,5.279,each of those bit string is according to
1478.32,5.12,this probability okay now what's this
1481.039,5.76,probability is the weight of this
1483.44,6.0,uniform and those from the exponential
1486.799,6.24,okay carry out the probability okay the
1489.44,6.16,issue is uh the b increase okay the real
1493.039,5.52,problem is the size increase as the
1495.6,5.36,depth increase the simulated this board
1498.559,4.801,using that classical computing is so
1500.96,4.16,hard remember the classical computing
1503.36,3.76,you when you need a sample from
1505.12,4.96,something that you need to know the true
1507.12,6.4,distribution okay to find out what's the
1510.08,6.079,true distribution it's very hard so hard
1513.52,5.12,as you increase the b and that in an
1516.159,5.361,increase m at that time the best the
1518.64,6.56,super computer can do is about it at b
1521.52,5.84,equal to around 50 m is about a 20 okay
1525.2,4.32,beyond that one we don't in principle
1527.36,4.48,there is the truth there but we don't
1529.52,4.96,know and and in the super computer
1531.84,4.959,cannot calculate that one remember the
1534.48,5.04,quantum computer do disassembly is
1536.799,5.681,relatively easy they are not calculating
1539.52,6.399,the underlying true probability
1542.48,6.559,they just ran this process uh to get the
1545.919,5.681,sampling okay so in a sense is that is
1549.039,4.321,the physics okay now you would see that
1551.6,4.64,when we talk about the computing
1553.36,4.64,everything is about physics and because
1556.24,4.4,we don't pay much attention if you do
1558.0,5.6,the sampling and using our current
1560.64,5.12,computer like mm mcmc basically you are
1563.6,5.04,using the electronic physics to do that
1565.76,5.2,simulate sampling and in this quantum
1568.64,4.48,cases they use in the quantum theory to
1570.96,5.199,calculate to do the assembly
1573.12,6.4,so the cases here is that the sampling
1576.159,5.681,problems also push this uh away it will
1579.52,4.72,be so hard for the uh for the classical
1581.84,4.88,building but quantum computing you can
1584.24,6.559,sense that one is eventually we will
1586.72,4.079,we'll get there demonstrate that things
1590.88,6.56,uh similarly for the uh for the boson
1593.679,6.801,sampling is using the uh the process
1597.44,5.28,from the uh optical systems you build up
1600.48,4.0,the photons passes through the beam
1602.72,4.48,sleeve and uh
1604.48,5.36,splitter and uh and the phone resources
1607.2,5.599,feed split basically build up uh
1609.84,5.6,operating systems and
1612.799,5.281,there's a m like a photons passes
1615.44,4.719,through this network at the end the
1618.08,4.24,photons will be appear here and there
1620.159,4.88,you'll find out where they are because
1622.32,5.28,the retinal needs the location of this
1625.039,4.481,you detect the location will have random
1627.6,4.559,so the random there will be have a
1629.52,4.8,underlying distribution okay and that
1632.159,4.081,underlying distribution similar to the
1634.32,5.12,random quantum surface is output
1636.24,5.76,distribution okay now in this case i we
1639.44,4.8,can write down exactly what's the output
1642.0,4.48,distribution the sample space is
1644.24,4.4,basically you assume that the m photons
1646.48,5.52,and m mode and
1648.64,6.72,also the state will be the m of those
1652.0,4.24,digits and the only constraint is those
1655.36,2.799,uh
1656.24,3.919,number must be equal to total number of
1658.159,4.24,and so you can easily find out the
1660.159,5.12,cardinality of this one is equal to this
1662.399,4.961,combinatorial number okay also
1665.279,4.241,remember this
1667.36,4.72,that this is the operating system is
1669.52,4.56,that there is a urinary matrix
1672.08,5.76,represented on these four systems like
1674.08,7.599,the circuit cases so there is a unitary
1677.84,6.4,matrix size of m times m and represented
1681.679,4.641,the whole system okay now with those
1684.24,4.96,things we can write down the probability
1686.32,5.28,of the true probability distribution so
1689.2,4.0,basically being each of those states
1691.6,4.559,this way the probability is equal to
1693.2,4.959,this denominator easy the numerator is
1696.159,4.801,you're using this state
1698.159,6.081,to from this this big matrix you've got
1700.96,5.76,the sample matrix from this one then you
1704.24,4.88,need to calculate the permanent okay not
1706.72,5.36,a determinant permanent is like the
1709.12,6.159,determinant except that the no signs
1712.08,5.52,minus i plus j here the no signs it's
1715.279,4.961,just all possible of all possible
1717.6,4.64,summation over here so it turns out
1720.24,4.319,unlike the determinant much easier to
1722.24,3.12,calculate the permanent is the p
1724.559,2.961,sharp
1725.36,5.679,complete complete uh complexity it's
1727.52,6.56,very hard so essentially it's the for
1731.039,6.0,the quantum computer you just ran this
1734.08,5.12,process you get the detected photons you
1737.039,4.481,got the sampling but for the classical
1739.2,4.4,computer in order to do the sampling you
1741.52,3.68,need to calculate those probabilities
1743.6,3.439,okay and then according to the
1745.2,4.479,probability due to sampling and
1747.039,5.601,calculating those probability is very
1749.679,5.841,very hard so also we increase the
1752.64,4.56,certain size of a certain point and you
1755.52,3.68,will see the quantum computer the
1757.2,4.8,classical computer won't be able uh to
1759.2,5.359,do that one okay so this is the similar
1762.0,5.12,the cases is the automation why those
1764.559,4.321,are sampling are easy for the quantum
1767.12,3.6,computer so hard for the classical
1768.88,5.6,computer okay
1770.72,6.319,now the one is uh here is you can see it
1774.48,5.76,as we in principle right now as we're
1777.039,6.481,pushing we can find out the way we can
1780.24,4.159,move in these things to that regime that
1783.52,2.879,is
1784.399,4.4,part of
1786.399,5.28,supercomputers won't be able to handle
1788.799,5.921,within the intractable regime
1791.679,4.88,now in that regime we don't know what's
1794.72,4.0,the truth
1796.559,4.72,because we cannot calculate quantum
1798.72,5.36,computers simulate the samples now how
1801.279,6.0,do we now you build up a quantum device
1804.08,5.52,you draw some data okay and how do you
1807.279,4.481,know this one is truly from that one the
1809.6,3.199,distribution which we won't be able to
1811.76,4.88,calculate
1812.799,6.401,so that to to demonstrate the claim of
1816.64,5.279,economists and premises you would need a
1819.2,5.68,statistics okay again that's a statistic
1821.919,5.841,to come to play is the one how do we
1824.88,5.12,benchmarking to prove uh quantum speed
1827.76,4.799,up in that case the sample you generated
1830.0,5.039,from that device indeed is from the uh
1832.559,4.161,true uh in targeted probability
1835.039,4.24,distribution
1836.72,4.959,now here there is the issue like you
1839.279,5.041,have the input and you have a quantum
1841.679,4.561,computer with resources you have the uh
1844.32,4.4,input from a classical computer with
1846.24,4.559,those uh resources you get an output
1848.72,4.64,quantum cases the output following the
1850.799,4.88,certain distributions and in the classic
1853.36,4.559,phases you may use the randomization and
1855.679,7.201,if it's another retinal and with the
1857.919,7.201,distributions uh to indicate the quantum
1862.88,5.039,speed up basically for the classical
1865.12,5.76,computer you'll need much more resources
1867.919,4.801,like the computing time piece and uh
1870.88,4.08,those kind of things then the quantum
1872.72,4.72,computer and then you can prove that
1874.96,6.559,there is a uh there is a quantum speed
1877.44,7.28,up now here automation how to uh prove
1881.519,5.52,these cases uh we need to uh generate a
1884.72,5.6,sample basically you need some kind of a
1887.039,5.12,benchmark apply on those distributions
1890.32,4.32,generate a result classical quantum
1892.159,4.64,cases and those are the performance on
1894.64,4.879,those benchmark two things we need to
1896.799,4.401,show one is statistical efficiency
1899.519,3.681,another one is the computational
1901.2,4.319,efficiency what's the statistic
1903.2,4.88,efficiency remember those quantum
1905.519,5.201,distributions of distribution are grow
1908.08,5.68,exponentially with the weightless with
1910.72,6.16,the size so if you wanted to try to
1913.76,4.32,estimate those distributions okay or
1916.88,2.639,anything
1918.08,4.479,uh like the
1919.519,6.081,fancy enough for those distributions you
1922.559,6.24,would needed an exponential uh sample
1925.6,5.28,size to estimate those things so there
1928.799,4.88,was the distinct efficiency we wanted
1930.88,4.32,means it went only allowed to have a
1933.679,4.641,polynomial
1935.2,5.199,symbol size what would allow us to
1938.32,4.239,estimate those things because in the
1940.399,4.481,interactive regime we don't know the
1942.559,4.801,truth we only have a sample from quantum
1944.88,5.2,computer we need to use statistics to
1947.36,4.559,estimate those benchmarks okay and you
1950.08,4.4,will later on you will i will show that
1951.919,5.12,on many like usual things won't be able
1954.48,5.12,to have that uh that
1957.039,4.961,statistic efficiency now for the
1959.6,5.52,computational efficiency it means we can
1962.0,4.88,calculate those uh benchmark in our
1965.12,4.399,polynomial time okay what are the
1966.88,5.36,explanation time so those one are the
1969.519,5.921,issues associated with that one
1972.24,5.679,now in this very simple cases in the
1975.44,4.239,factoring problems they you can easily
1977.919,3.841,say that both statistical and
1979.679,3.761,computational division like if you go to
1981.76,3.68,the integration of prime you put a
1983.44,4.32,number there the solution in the correct
1985.44,5.2,order just multiply those together
1987.76,5.2,simply find out it's cracked or not and
1990.64,4.32,so the computational efficiency is very
1992.96,4.079,easy so the distribution is also easy
1994.96,3.92,because you estimated those probability
1997.039,3.601,you don't need a database experiment you
1998.88,4.159,only needed a polynomial number of an
2000.64,6.72,assembly to estimate those those things
2003.039,6.24,now in the cases of the noise quantum
2007.36,4.08,computer okay remember the one what do
2009.279,3.921,we have it's not a perfect fundamental
2011.44,4.8,computer it's the noise version instead
2013.2,4.88,of the noise there so we can we can
2016.24,3.76,define the similar case if you put a
2018.08,5.28,star here to illustrate it they are the
2020.0,6.24,noise version of the idealized cases
2023.36,4.96,there is a noise uh version of that one
2026.24,5.2,so we needed a benchmark we need to
2028.32,5.359,apply the measure that noise uh like the
2031.44,4.64,uh generate from noise quantum computer
2033.679,4.321,generated data and the classical uh
2036.08,4.479,generated data away
2038.0,5.12,and again we need to handle statistical
2040.559,6.081,efficiency and combination efficiency
2043.12,6.08,for those uh benchmark uh automation if
2046.64,5.36,you're using the usual things like for
2049.2,4.959,example the distribution of these
2052.0,5.599,distribution there's a true distribution
2054.159,5.121,okay and of of this one for the truth
2057.599,3.04,basically all of those targets we're
2059.28,4.0,trying to looking for the true
2060.639,4.881,distribution okay now if you're using
2063.28,5.839,compare this one using all those
2065.52,6.96,distance okay usual distance and it
2069.119,5.52,turns out uh the proof basically using
2072.48,4.8,the quantum thermography and audiencing
2074.639,5.44,you would require exponential number of
2077.28,4.639,sample size to and illustrate to
2080.079,5.361,estimate those uh
2081.919,6.48,those difference and and estimate so it
2085.44,5.36,won't be a statistically efficient and
2088.399,5.841,the google did define the so-called
2090.8,5.44,cross uh entropy benchmark and using
2094.24,3.92,some of the as a reporting like i
2096.24,4.24,mentioned that tom's portland port
2098.16,4.959,thomas regime distribution to come up
2100.48,4.48,with that one we showed it's a it is a
2103.119,4.081,statistical division that only needed
2104.96,3.6,that polynomial sample to estimate this
2107.2,3.68,benchmark
2108.56,4.88,uh computationally none of them are
2110.88,4.479,computationally efficient is because
2113.44,3.6,quantum computer i'm not trying to
2115.359,3.921,calculate the underlying true
2117.04,5.52,distribution the classical computer
2119.28,5.559,won't be able to calculate uh do the
2122.56,5.6,sample calculate the true uh
2124.839,5.801,distributions over the
2128.16,5.28,for that for the over the like the
2130.64,5.92,quantum supremacy regime like once at
2133.44,5.6,that kind of intractable regime uh no
2136.56,5.6,one knows what's the true underlying
2139.04,7.28,output distribution so you can only like
2142.16,7.28,stop this will will work so largely to
2146.32,6.0,rely on the statistics you build up uh
2149.44,4.639,using those samples but you didn't need
2152.32,3.6,the calculator the two of them need to
2154.079,3.841,calculate you need exponential number of
2155.92,5.439,times so what you do you use in the
2157.92,6.8,statistic data uh to build up statistic
2161.359,6.401,models and do the extrapolations and
2164.72,6.399,illustrate this point now whether this
2167.76,6.319,is a case is sure that one is still
2171.119,6.401,there that there's another uh uh enough
2174.079,5.76,uh things to do research on this part so
2177.52,5.68,this is the one of them that illustrate
2179.839,5.28,uh that point how much time do you have
2183.2,6.639,okay five minutes alright
2185.119,7.841,so uh this is the basic uh uh scheme and
2189.839,6.24,to study for this one now what's the uh
2192.96,6.639,result like the the two uh project like
2196.079,6.801,the google and ustc and they showed that
2199.599,5.601,uh quantum supremacies so basically they
2202.88,5.12,all of those results are amazing that
2205.2,5.28,they are based on circumstantial uh
2208.0,5.28,evidence because they're intractable
2210.48,5.68,regimes we really don't know what's
2213.28,5.12,what's the truth and uh on the other
2216.16,5.04,hand we want to claim that
2218.4,4.959,it will happen or that happened okay so
2221.2,4.879,basically what they do is they build up
2223.359,5.521,and use the engineer physics and
2226.079,5.841,simplify the models and uh
2228.88,5.68,collect the data and analyze what
2231.92,5.28,happened in the interactive regime okay
2234.56,5.44,and then trying to infer what happened
2237.2,4.879,in the uh sorry tractable regime what
2240.0,5.04,happened in the interactive regime you
2242.079,5.441,see what happened there now in the like
2245.04,5.12,the google studies they uh for these are
2247.52,5.04,simplified like circles and they collect
2250.16,5.6,the data sample and they're using quite
2252.56,6.16,a sophisticated statistics based on 30
2255.76,5.68,million of the data and in the end of
2258.72,6.16,the estimate it is a benchmark and it's
2261.44,6.56,0.2 uh percent what it means uh in that
2264.88,5.44,sense the claim is about that uh 0.2
2268.0,4.64,percent of the bit strings are truly
2270.32,4.88,come from the idealized output
2272.64,4.959,distribution okay now if you're using
2275.2,4.56,the using the super computer okay
2277.599,5.361,classical super computer trying to
2279.76,5.92,generate a bit stream with match up with
2282.96,5.84,at least with this kind of like that uh
2285.68,6.0,like the uh fidelities like this much of
2288.8,5.44,the data come from output distributions
2291.68,6.159,uh they illustrate that one is with a
2294.24,5.76,different with 53 uh qubits okay fifty
2297.839,4.641,three cubes remember that uh is the
2300.0,5.76,stated omega is the two to the power of
2302.48,6.24,53 that's a big size okay and with the
2305.76,5.28,depth 12 they were estimated two hours
2308.72,3.68,to calculate this one and by the
2311.04,4.319,classical computer
2312.4,5.12,and increase based on these models
2315.359,4.961,statistic confidence bootstrap all those
2317.52,5.839,things now in the end of the estimate at
2320.32,5.279,the trendiest that one we don't we the
2323.359,4.48,supercomputer cannot calculate what
2325.599,5.121,happened there the estimator build up
2327.839,5.52,this model you see that one require 10
2330.72,5.04,000 years to do that
2333.359,4.641,like the sampling and the 200 uh a
2335.76,5.12,second assembly december by the way one
2338.0,4.56,minute one billion bit stream okay and
2340.88,3.68,to assemble one billion businessmen it
2342.56,4.559,will take the ten thousand years by the
2344.56,4.559,uh ambassador super computer to that
2347.119,4.081,time now again
2349.119,4.24,if you wanted to calculate this one this
2351.2,3.76,part is that really if you want to truly
2353.359,3.201,calculate it you can see the break they
2354.96,3.44,did in the calculator what happened it
2356.56,4.32,would take millions millions of years
2358.4,4.56,more years to actually you calculated
2360.88,4.32,those uh underlying distribution this is
2362.96,5.36,just the sampling project
2365.2,6.0,now once this result published there's
2368.32,4.4,many immediately like
2371.2,4.879,like the challenge
2372.72,7.04,reviewed about the claims result and
2376.079,7.28,with the main is ranging from the device
2379.76,6.64,noise the new algorithms come out and
2383.359,6.641,the combination models the statistical
2386.4,5.12,uh issues the evidence all of those
2390.0,3.839,things are
2391.52,4.0,related to that one and so there's a lot
2393.839,2.721,of like the
2395.52,2.72,debate
2396.56,4.799,discussion and
2398.24,6.16,continuing uh phone against on both
2401.359,6.641,sides and about these are issues
2404.4,7.919,now for the ustc project and they
2408.0,6.0,actually argued uh is there's a 0.99 uh
2412.319,4.081,percent of fidelity basically there's
2414.0,4.72,not much noise they're trying to see
2416.4,4.4,that in the simplified cases or the
2418.72,5.28,smaller cases they can check with
2420.8,6.08,against the underlying distributions and
2424.0,4.96,find out very uh feet and then they just
2426.88,4.56,said well in the in the
2428.96,4.48,intractable regime should be should we
2431.44,4.399,work and also the buildup for the
2433.44,5.44,classical computings what's the time
2435.839,6.401,required the sample data are 200 second
2438.88,6.08,jobs and basically it estimated it will
2442.24,5.359,be like that 0.6 billion years at the
2444.96,5.76,best quantum computer okay now of course
2447.599,6.801,those are tons of like issues and the
2450.72,6.879,debate and even largely is because they
2454.4,5.439,existing a wide range of uh
2457.599,5.041,views about the quantum computing
2459.839,5.441,ranging from the hype to the uh
2462.64,5.28,skepticism of skepticism about the
2465.28,5.12,fundamental complications and even for
2467.92,5.04,these quantum supremacies uh they
2470.4,4.719,illustrate even just from the purely
2472.96,4.72,statistical point of views you would see
2475.119,5.841,that a lot of like uh issues to be uh
2477.68,6.159,resolved so if we expect a long-term
2480.96,5.28,race between the uh fast like the
2483.839,5.681,classical algorithms and the improved
2486.24,6.48,device so it will be continue probably
2489.52,5.839,until we build up a quantum computer
2492.72,5.28,actually can run those like short
2495.359,5.041,algorithms and that you immediately get
2498.0,4.64,to to demonstrate that theoretically
2500.4,4.959,proving advantage maybe at that point
2502.64,6.56,things can be uh settled now this is
2505.359,5.601,just one cases furthermore is that if
2509.2,3.36,there's a lot of more of the interface
2510.96,3.76,between the statistics and the
2512.56,4.64,fundamental computer remember to build
2514.72,4.96,up a quantum computer you are needed
2517.2,4.96,like the many cases like that there's
2519.68,4.96,quantum systems that so many parameters
2522.16,4.72,models and you'll see involve a lot of
2524.64,4.56,issues due to for building
2526.88,5.199,uh for building quantum computing in in
2529.2,5.119,the involved statistics and also you
2532.079,4.321,build up the device you will see how do
2534.319,4.401,now the device will performance
2536.4,4.88,according to your design so that the
2538.72,4.96,certifications based on the many uh
2541.28,3.68,issues is highly related the quality
2543.68,4.639,inference and
2544.96,5.52,in that part so another on on the other
2548.319,4.561,hand if we have uh
2550.48,4.56,like the quantum computers you would see
2552.88,4.4,the greater potential to revolutionize
2555.04,4.0,many of the statistical computations and
2557.28,4.319,the machine learning things
2559.04,4.559,now much more of of the much beyond
2561.599,4.561,these statistics and a lot of things
2563.599,4.801,going on in that quantum computer thank
2566.16,2.24,you
2570.319,3.441,any questions for you adam
2577.76,4.88,i really mean not true that i understand
2580.48,4.56,you compel quantum
2582.64,4.56,computer to general prepares computer
2585.04,4.799,what you call classical general purpose
2587.2,5.76,computer to be fair you have to compare
2589.839,5.921,it to a silicon based machine that is
2592.96,4.879,specially proposed built to solve a
2595.76,4.48,specific problem
2597.839,4.881,can you what would be the result then
2600.24,4.64,that's a fair comparison otherwise i
2602.72,5.28,would ask you to compare quantum
2604.88,4.959,computer to leave computer which
2608.0,4.64,is the best
2609.839,5.441,computer i know to where to compute the
2612.64,5.36,path of a leaf falling in the freezer
2615.28,5.6,yeah that's real fair questions and i
2618.0,5.839,think that the one we are not at that
2620.88,5.199,stage i think because of that uh like at
2623.839,4.961,this point we have all those theory they
2626.079,5.04,are approved and we just people are
2628.8,4.039,trying to say can you show some things
2631.119,4.401,and in the in the in the real
2632.839,5.641,calculations and this one again is just
2635.52,4.72,one of the uh demonstrating the concept
2638.48,4.8,maybe you can say in this like in the
2640.24,5.2,statistic sense and uh uh to show that
2643.28,4.64,either cases we can compute that one
2645.44,4.8,like that that seems you you you
2647.92,5.76,mentioned yes it failed but we are not
2650.24,3.44,that yet far from there yet
2656.72,5.52,okay so is there a program that people
2659.68,5.679,can turn every classical algorithm with
2662.24,4.879,a quantum computing computer algorithm
2665.359,4.081,is there a systematic approach to do
2667.119,4.801,that yeah it's basically that all the
2669.44,4.0,classical algorithm can be traded as a
2671.92,4.0,quantum algorithm
2673.44,4.8,and because of that all those that like
2675.92,4.64,a gate operation can be realized by the
2678.24,4.16,quantum gate the real issue in the
2680.56,4.0,quantum computation well in order to say
2682.4,4.0,that that those can be feed to the
2684.56,4.24,fundamental combination we are looking
2686.4,5.12,for that fast speed
2688.8,4.799,so if you can for the certain things
2691.52,4.64,even because you can convert it that way
2693.599,4.24,if it is no faster speed no speed up so
2696.16,4.32,we don't lock it that way so we are
2697.839,4.321,looking for the fast way you you can you
2700.48,5.119,for the certain problem you do the
2702.16,5.36,quantum ways can compute much faster
2705.599,3.52,so you don't know which uh give your
2707.52,4.799,argument you cannot tell me which ones
2709.119,5.521,faster uh in in well the quantum
2712.319,4.0,computer can never be slower than the
2714.64,3.84,the classical computer because of
2716.319,4.321,automation all those classical uh
2718.48,4.639,algorithms can be traded to that uh
2720.64,4.4,quantum algorithm
2723.119,4.96,they cannot be slower but that whether
2725.04,5.76,they can be faster or not it's it's
2728.079,5.52,is it obvious it's more energy efficient
2730.8,5.68,uh well that's no
2733.599,4.48,yeah like the cost and uh like the cost
2736.48,3.92,the energy efficiency that's not
2738.079,2.321,effective
2741.76,2.88,the
2742.56,4.799,couple of slides back the the point two
2744.64,4.64,percent um measure statistics that you
2747.359,5.121,had would you call that good or
2749.28,5.52,good or bad well uh the one is i the one
2752.48,6.56,is remember the goal of that one is
2754.8,6.96,trying to have some problems uh there's
2759.04,4.64,no private practical purpose that can be
2761.76,3.839,used in practice it doesn't create a
2763.68,5.28,problem to demonstrate these concepts
2765.599,3.361,yeah that's my question
2769.76,4.0,so if we restrict our attention to
2771.92,3.76,quantum supremacy experiments and
2773.76,4.48,hopefully in the next few years there
2775.68,4.639,are a couple more coming out what do you
2778.24,4.24,think are the outstanding statistical
2780.319,3.76,questions that needs to be answered that
2782.48,5.28,haven't been answered so far in those
2784.079,6.961,papers i feel that even for the quantum
2787.76,6.079,supremacy uh project like for example
2791.04,5.36,there is a lot of like that yeah if you
2793.839,4.961,trying to let's say using that fda like
2796.4,5.12,that in the pharmaceutical company we
2798.8,5.519,develop a new drug way there's a lot of
2801.52,5.52,statistics you go to the fda you need to
2804.319,6.481,check all those analyses if you use that
2807.04,6.72,one of the golden standard okay uh
2810.8,5.84,probably many of those analyses won't be
2813.76,5.2,able to pass that that'll stand up okay
2816.64,5.199,so there's a ton of issue i think
2818.96,4.96,probably that like for example in these
2821.839,5.52,problems like in the google study
2823.92,6.159,problems and like there's a noise model
2827.359,4.48,for uh the noise model there right and
2830.079,5.201,the quantum computer to generate the
2831.839,6.48,data from that noise models and like i
2835.28,6.0,and we and the others they try to look
2838.319,5.201,at it does the data really feed it to
2841.28,4.319,that the model the physical model there
2843.52,4.72,does not statistically test basically
2845.599,4.641,reject uh the hypotheses does not fit
2848.24,4.319,into the model but we know now uh
2850.24,5.68,because there's so many complicated
2852.559,6.401,issues there and we we couldn't find out
2855.92,5.28,any suitable model defeating the data
2858.96,5.68,but on the other hand there's so many uh
2861.2,3.44,automation that you should say yeah
2865.76,4.96,that might be used to
2868.4,4.56,guess what the life form of the noise
2870.72,5.359,model of data beyond the global
2872.96,5.04,depolarized error model yeah it's not a
2876.079,4.561,i don't have a solution to that one
2878.0,5.2,that's why we need more statisticians to
2880.64,3.6,work in this field and hopefully
2883.2,3.84,that
2884.24,2.8,resolves many
2890.16,5.88,so i see there are no more questions so
2891.76,4.28,let's start together again for this
