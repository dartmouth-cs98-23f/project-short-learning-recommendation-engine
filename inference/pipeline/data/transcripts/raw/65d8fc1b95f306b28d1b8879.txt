artificial intelligence is making rapid
strides
there's talk of a new evolution that
could fundamentally change
life on our planet artificial
intelligence has the potential to
revolutionize every aspect of daily life
work mobility medicine the economy and
communication
but will ai really make medicine better
and doctors superfluous
when will self-driving cars hit our
roads
will intelligent robots usurp our jobs
and are we heading for a dystopia
with no privacy and total surveillance
what exactly is artificial intelligence
and how much can it really do
what will change and what will remain
pure fantasy
to answer these questions we embarked on
an exciting journey
to meet the scientists working on our
future in the us
britain germany and china
[Music]
our first stop silicon valley in
california
apple google and facebook all have their
headquarters here
it's the epicenter of the digital
revolution
the tech industry has changed the face
of the san francisco bay area
new startup companies launch every day
rents have exploded and artificial
intelligence is the buzzword
a new type of supermarket recently
opened its doors here
amazon go all you need here is an app
hold your mobile phone to the scanner
and you're in
[Music]
as leonardo shows me amazon's new menus
and explains that the language assistant
alexa can help with the preparation at
home
i'm under constant surveillance
which shelf do i stop at
which products am i interested in
on the ceiling sensors and cameras
intelligent image recognition captures
my every move
what do i take off the shelf what do i
put back and what do i take with me
this branch is still in its test phase
but amazon plans to open 50 such grocery
stores this year alone
the end of the sales assistant just walk
out
no more standing in line no cashiers
i feel a bit like a shoplifter as i
leave
comfort at the cost of privacy
my receipt
one block away a robot cafe
another test lab for the future
order by app and touch screen
the increasingly ubiquitous tools of
trade
my first ever cup of coffee served by a
robot
so this is the taste of the future
ai will change our shopping experience
but what will happen to employees
stanford university is at the forefront
of global ai research with an annual
budget of 6.5 billion dollars
[Music]
i want to know how will artificial
intelligence
change medicine
researchers here have developed an
artificial intelligence algorithm that
can screen
x-rays for certain diseases computer
scientist pranav rajpurkar shows me how
easy it is to use
take a picture of an x-ray with your
mobile phone upload the image
and a few seconds later you get the
diagnosis
it's a mass and it's saying this thing
over here
is a possibly cancerous lesion and i can
see that right over here
okay so it gives you if i may have a
look at it
now probabilities for pneumonia
inaudible edema effusion and that goes
bank
yeah now how does this work i mean how
did you get to the point
we started with a large data set of
chest x-rays
which were released by the nih and these
contained
x-rays and then also labels of different
pathologies
and whether they existed in those x-rays
so it might say okay here's an image and
on this image i have
pathology one two and three and we had
hundred thousand of these images
[Music]
so we trained a model that can
take in it as an input and x-ray and
then output the probability of
several different pathologies on this
x-ray
artificial intelligence is modeled on
the human brain
a gigantic network of almost 100 billion
interconnected neurons
put in very simple terms this is how a
brain cell works
incoming impulses are passed in a domino
effect from one neuron
to the next the resulting circuit
connects the neurons and it is this
circuit that artificial intelligence
tries to simulate
as a digital neural network
like our brains the network can learn
how to identify tuberculosis for
instance
first the network needs to be trained or
taught
x-rays of tuberculosis patients are fed
to the system
initially it struggles to correctly
identify the condition
but every time an x-ray is fed in the
network's structure is adapted
and its diagnostic ability improves
it takes thousands and thousands of
clinical data sets to train the machine
only after the network is optimized in
this way
can it correctly identify an unknown
x-ray
[Music]
but how accurate is artificial
intelligence compared to a doctor's
expertise
we have actually done this test twice at
this point
once with a set of studies from the
nih data set that we had a group of
radiologists label
and then we compared the accuracy of the
model to the radiologist
and we found that they were very similar
in terms of accuracy on most pathologies
on one of them the model was
outperforming the radiologists and on
three of them
the radiologists were outperforming the
model and then we repeated the
experiment this time using a data set
from stanford
which we recently released which is 200
thousand chest x-rays
and then we had a similar setup where we
had
three sub-specialty radiologists these
are very uncommon very trained
radiologists to decide what the ground
truth for a particular set of images was
and then we compared general
radiologists to the algorithm at the
task and found that they had similar
levels of performance
so these are all stanford radiologists
so so they're
they're trained they should be good yeah
[Music]
reading x-rays accurately is a
complicated process
but artificial intelligence is making
fast progress
when it comes to identifying or
recognizing simple images
computers have surpassed human accuracy
now if i look at your picture it's
always probability
so there are cases where the machine is
not
really sure what what would be sort of a
clear decision to say okay this
is i don't know pneumonia or something
else yeah
i think i mean i think it's good to talk
in terms of probabilities
because probabilities also give a sense
of
the algorithm the model's uncertainty on
that particular problem
i think one difficulty with
probabilities is that it does
make it hard for humans to interpret
like what is the probability of 88
versus 92 percent mean in terms of the
decision i should make in the clinic
and so i think in that sense one of the
things that
we could experiment with doing in the
future is rather than showing
probabilities that are so
fine-grained maybe we can show things
like unlikely
or this pathology is likely or this
pathology is
possible in healthcare
artificial intelligence is powering a
revolution
scientists are using artificial
intelligence algorithms to sift through
seemingly banal data
such as the up and down motion of the
steps we take every day
they're looking for conspicuous patterns
that could serve as early warning signs
of disease
scientists in the english city of
birmingham are working on a
revolutionary diagnostic method
to date there are no specific tests to
detect parkinson's disease
making diagnosis difficult ai could
change that
max little is a mathematician at aston
university
[Music]
very good voice changes can be an early
indicator of parkinson's
max and his team collected thousands of
vocal recordings
and fed them to an algorithm they
developed which learned to detect
differences in voice patterns between
people with
and without the condition in a lab-based
study of the recordings the algorithm
was able to correctly identify a
parkinson's diagnosis
nearly 99 of the time max
little's work is an example of the
far-reaching changes ai
is bringing to the field of medicine
it's no longer just doctors who are
using artificial intelligence to develop
new diagnostic methods but data
scientists
programmers and mathematicians like max
[Music]
one example when a person walks sensors
in their smartphone register the up and
down motion of their gate
[Music]
but what information can be gleaned from
such data
if we measured a pattern of someone's
walking behavior
then someone who's healthy might have we
might measure the accelerometer
to look like that okay so it's just the
sort of movement
he would have here yeah the hips going
up and down regularly that kind of thing
along with their pace
but if you looked at somebody with
parkinson's disease they may have these
small steps like this and they may be
irregular or they may have patterns like
that
or they may even freeze and stop like
that so you
you can see that there's you know
there's a difference there's a
difference
so you can also now train an algorithm
for instance to pick out features like
what is the
the distance between the time distance
between these uh these
peaks and it could also do the same with
this and it would be able to do that
very precisely
and by doing so we may be able to
measure for instance that here that
there's large variability in between
these um the advantage of the algorithm
really comes when
the for instance you might have somebody
who who is say
who measures a pattern which looks like
this
and there might just be one small
change perhaps that that occurs
very very um maybe not like that but
sort of
you know some uh more variation that's
right in the
in the sequence of these um in the
timing of these
these events um even to a professional
eye
because they don't have the level of
precision they may not be able to
detect that this is outside of so the
normal range
of um a variation but of course an
algorithm connected to a
high precision sensor um we'll you know
we'll be able to determine that
difference and in this case
this person here may in fact have um a
precursor symptom of the disease
so this would mean that this person
with the help of an algorithm could be
diagnosed
as having parkinson whereas the doctor
himself
would miss him out that could for the
first time
make it possible to detect precursor
symptoms of parkinson's
and enable early intervention
but what else does the data on our
smartphones reveal
right now you have already apps
tracking your so-called activity yeah
so in fact the data
might be already there well the data
potentially could be there
that's right but there are ethics about
whether we collect that kind of data
and use it for for these sorts of
purposes
you know clearly we can't just collect
this data and
start diagnosing people which sure
we should not no absolutely we could but
we
we really wouldn't want to there are
very good reasons not to do it
and uh there may be good reasons for
doing it as well
but that's the kind of thing that needs
that needs to be worked through in a
uh in a proper you know regulated
setting
[Music]
after our interview max little tells me
he's received
several lucrative offers to join tech
giants who smell new business
opportunities
he turned them down
artificial intelligence will undoubtedly
improve doctors abilities to detect
and diagnose disease
but amid all the opportunities ai offers
there's an urgent need for regulation
we're on our way to china a country that
has experienced
breathtaking change in recent years
[Music]
its capital beijing is buzzing
the whole country is hungry for progress
and is on a fast track to the future
[Music]
time seems to move faster here by the
year 2030
china aims to be the global leader in
the field of artificial intelligence
and there's a lot to indicate it will
meet that goal because the government
has bankrolled subsidy programs worth
billions of euros
[Music]
these robots aren't assembling cars
they're the big attraction in beijing's
latest
smart restaurant
ai in the kitchen and automated waiters
i have a meeting here with the design
researcher geisha yost
a former internet ambassador for the
german government she's currently
spending a research semester at tongji
university in shanghai i asked her about
her impressions of china
[Music]
there's this real hunger in the city and
it's super fun to talk to young people
because they want to be the motors of
change
they work day and night they have a new
work-life balance model it's called 996.
i thought what do you mean 996. and they
said we work from 9am
to 9pm six days a week
that's the better model now because they
used to just work non-stop
but no one's stopping no one's hitting
the brakes they work like crazy because
they want to bring about change
as a this restaurant cost 20 million
dollars
just the one restaurant they've invested
this huge sum to digitize the entire
operation
they aren't just robots serving the food
the whole kitchen is digitized
refrigeration is monitored supply chains
are monitored
there are dashboards for everything
everything is connected here
where they're testing what works and
which aspects can be implemented in
other restaurants of this chain
that's the idea here to just try things
and to think big
[Music]
think
[Music]
but what about privacy
there seem to be a trade-off between
security and privacy
you often hear how ai has increased
public safety for instance that the
ubiquitous surveillance cameras have
dramatically increased the crime solving
rate
it's hard for us to relate to because
privacy and personal rights are so
important for germans
but here there's a different tradition
and take on the issue
i'm fascinated by china but it also
puzzles me
how can they be reconciled the high
civilization of ancient china
and the modern industrial state with
surveillance cameras everywhere
[Music]
the long gan district in shenzhen
in the heart of china's booming economic
region north of hong kong
we visit the smart city control center
a giant monitor displays the data of the
entire district in real time
numbers of new residents by neighborhood
to plan schools
water supply levels power outages
all this information is collected
compiled and evaluated
using artificial intelligence the
showcase project
was developed with chinese tech giant
huawei
chief engineer chen bangtai tells me the
city now operates more efficiently
so what you're doing here is urban
planning
yes the systems are a big help
these are hospital beds
right now there are 15 000 doctors and
nurses
and 7 600 beds so is shenzhen currently
healthy or sick
[Music]
a smart surveillance system scans the
entire city
illegal structures like this one on a
roof are quickly identified and
demolished
to me some of this feels like the
backdrop to a science fiction movie
employees with live streaming body cams
inspect side streets
this is total surveillance
chan shows me how cameras installed in
restaurant kitchens
even keep tabs on cleanliness but
doesn't the chef
mind being monitored all the time
chen says residents of long gang
district approve
jaywalking is not allowed and offenders
are immediately identified
look here you jaywalk once and right
away your social credit score drops
this degree of surveillance is
unthinkable in the west
but here in china they take a different
view and say it's driven a drop in crime
what does it say here male youth without
glasses
youth
yes suddenly you're a youth
[Music]
a transparent society in the interest of
efficiency
some of this appears useful but do we
really want to measure
control and analyze everything just
because
it's technically possible
won't that inevitably lead us down a
road to data dictatorship
maybe trust is better than smart control
[Music]
silicon valley a synonym for innovation
and unlimited freedom
the biggest players in the field of ai
are based here
but their headquarters are hidden behind
inconspicuous low-rise buildings
facebook we use their services entrust
them with our data
but the company is impervious to the
public
a selfie at the entrance gate is just
about tolerated
[Music]
next door at apple the visitor center's
3d model of the campus is as close as
non-employees can get to the new
building
what's going on inside
[Music]
it's all confidential
[Music]
we want to visit google here in
california and requested an interview
weeks before our arrival but all we get
are stalling tactics like these visitors
google leaves us out in the cold
apart from a small store this is the
only visitor highlight
accessible to the public
these android lawn statues are even a
designated location on google maps
[Applause]
welcome to google google
[Music]
the european union handing google a 2.7
billion dollar
anti-trust fine
these companies command growing power
over our daily lives
and growing political influence google
spends more than 6 million euros a year
lobbying brussels alone the eu's
transparency register
lists more than 200 meetings with google
representatives since 2014.
google is the busiest lobbyist in
brussels
[Music]
we finally get our interview not in
california
but in munich germany with one of the
longest serving employees
jens redma how important is ai for
google
ai is so important to us that two years
ago we rebranded our entire research
division to google ai
ai drives a significant part of our
product development
ai above all drives a significant part
of our efforts to improve the quality of
our products
take machine translation through the use
of machine algorithms
we've seen faster progress over the last
two years than we did over the entire
previous decade
society will undoubtedly be propelled
forward by the implementation of these
services and the use of ai in the years
to come
what's key is that it's done responsibly
under the principles of transparency
we need to explain how things work why
they are needed where people's data goes
how they can control it how they can
delete it if they want to delete it
or forward it the user must have control
but what about technologies like google
home the smart
microphone sitting in people's living
rooms
google home isn't eavesdropping there's
a small chip on the device that listens
out for the so-called hot word
it's waiting for the command ok google
or hey google
and only then is the microphone switched
on to send a voice command or search
request to the internet
the google server it then presents the
results
so as a science reporter i'm naturally
curious about the future
there's this patent application from
september 2016.
google's application gives a detailed
account of what can be deduced from
household noises
how long we brush our teeth whether we
argue
or whether a housemate is ill
it's much more about capturing
atmosphere and habits than words
and it's a google patent application
that anyone can look up
i don't know anything about this
particular patent application
we have a whole series of patent
applications every year most of them are
imaginary fictitious services
which like in many other companies are
never translated into real services
[Music]
services google's eu lobbying activities
at least
are unarguably real
[Music]
how much does google intervene in the eu
i think the more important question is
the one that lies between the lines
namely how ethically does a company deal
with product development
and we have set our own rules according
to principles that guide our own actions
research and product development that
also guides our business decisions
on its home turf in the united states
google is facing
mounting political pressure in
washington we meet barry lynn
head of the think tank open market
institute he warns of the dangers posed
by tech giants influence
we need to know in our society that the
people who bring information
to the public sphere who talk to the
press
who talk to the rep our representatives
uh in congress that they represent their
own
selves that they're speaking in their
own name and not for someone else
that they're not stooges that they're
not puppets and the fact is today our
society this is true
here in washington is true in europe our
society is filled with puppets
with stooges who represent the interests
of google
and facebook and amazon
given big tech's monopoly power calls
for regulation are growing louder in
washington
when you have a monopoly whether it's
over retail whether it's over search
then it means that the the public
doesn't actually have the ability to
understand
how that information is being used how
that power is being used monopoly
per se unless it is regulated closely by
the public is a danger
google means to take over
the world they mean to direct
our thoughts between person and person
our communications between person and
person
our dealings and business between
person and corporation they mean to
direct
everything that they can they want to
know what's going on in our
thermostats and our houses they want to
know what we're watching on tv
they are at a level of
hubris that even the the stalinists
could never
have imagined uh uh pushing for
google facebook amazon will the
influence of tech giants continue to
grow
what can be done to rein in their
monopolies
one thing is clear artificial
intelligence is consolidating their grip
on power
there's an urgent need to rethink
anti-trust policy
[Music]
mobility is another area in which ai is
powering the march of innovation
in the near future it could put
self-driving cars on city roads
but how realistic is this vision
we've come to boston to the prestigious
massachusetts
institute of technology
certus caraman is a leading expert in
the field of self-driving cars
he and his team are working on prototype
autonomous vehicles
i think that we've nailed a couple items
with
computers and machines one is all of
this mapping and localization all that
technology
works super well computers can know
where they are
within centimeter maybe sometimes with a
millimeter precision way more than what
is required to drive
computers are not able to look around
and understand
where everybody else's but that's not
that's not what's required for driving
what's really required
is to understand what's going to happen
next in the next three seconds
five seconds next minutes maybe even
sometimes next hour
and so that's the key missing piece and
i think the problem there
is that right now it's very hard
for you to describe to me how you
understand
whether or not a person is going to use
the sidewalk
or is going to use the crosswalk and
cross the street
sometimes you look at the face of a
person and that facial impression gives
them away
and you will slow down sometimes not
they may be looking at the same
direction
they may be standing in the same
location it's just a little face
impression
maybe just the way they stand and
unfortunately that kind of
intuition gut feeling and so on is
very hard for us to program into the
computers
[Music]
it works in a simple lab environment but
in real life settings the algorithms are
still totally out of their depth
not that that bothers advertisers
our test drives were nothing but a
series of glitches
an inexplicable emergency stop
and another one on the second attempt
the sensors on this vehicle were over
taxed by a car parked on the curb
and here this smart car overlooked a car
veering into our lane
well that didn't work talking to the mit
engineers
it becomes clear that to build a
self-driving car
developers need to meet a massive scale
of technical requirements
what i think about fully autonomous cars
is that i think i would be very
surprised
if it happens in less than 10 years also
i will be very surprised i'm a big
believer i'd be very surprised if it
doesn't happen in 20 30 years
i think it will happen at some point but
i do think that people really
underestimate the kind of technology
required to be built
to make your car fully autonomous under
every condition every circumstance every
whatsoever
that's the very hard part
[Music]
[Applause]
ultra fun driving is not as trivial a
process as you might think
and that's because you constantly have
to watch what's going on around you
cyclists pedestrians sometimes you have
to second guess
does this guy want to cross the road or
not it's hard to imagine all that being
calculated automatically
[Music]
[Music]
a self-driving vehicle would have to be
able to deal with all of this too
here we have a truck doing a three-point
turn
i may have to back up now if he doesn't
make it
[Music]
does she want to cross the road or not
some people don't even wait
[Music]
the fully autonomous car is a distant
dream but driver assistance systems are
already making our
roads safer
an accident filmed from a car equipped
with emergency brake assist
the sequence of events can be assessed
in slow motion
the red vehicle ahead overlooks the
upcoming traffic jam
no brake lights appear but the distance
sensor in this
car registers the jam breaks and
prevents a further collision
but which principles should guide
decisions made by technology in an
accident situation
in recent years mit's media lab has been
addressing the ethical questions raised
by artificial intelligence
what moral compass should future smart
devices refer to
[Music]
is one of the world's leading experts on
such issues
he and his team developed a survey
called the moral machine to explore
ethics for programming autonomous
vehicles
like in the event of an accident
most of the time people don't remember
anything
and people have no time to react
everything happens very quickly
so they just are surprised
maybe they see something in front of
them and they just swerve in
some random direction or maybe they just
freak out and
press the brakes so you cannot expect a
human being to do the right thing
in that small exactly in that in such a
small time scale unless you know they
they made a decision beforehand like you
know did they
drink and drive or did they know that
they were going to cross a red light
then you blame them but otherwise you
can't really blame the human
but with a machine because of the speed
of the
electronics because the autonomous car
is evaluating the environment
you know millions of times per second
then time goes much slower for the
machine and it's able to
recalculate the situation and maybe
recalculate the strategy
and this is where we can make
a potentially better judgment than the
whatever random
choice the human used to make in this
situation
now what is better though is a very
interesting question and it's not
obvious and let's see a case where we
have people versus people so now we have
um the vehicle has two people inside of
it
okay and um it's going to either
swerve and hit the barrier so the people
will die in the car
or the car will go straight and kill the
pedestrians the pedestrians
who are crossing illegally but they're
also women and
and these uh the people in the car are
males so now
it gets very complicated very quickly
should you prioritize women over men or
should everybody be the same
should you prioritize pedestrian over
passenger or not
should you take into account the fact
that people are
crossing illegally in this case so as
you can see
once you have multiple dimensions it
becomes
not obvious what the right thing to do
is
a or b who should die
the elderly lady crossing on red
or the child in the self-driving car
what choice
should the algorithm make ead's online
survey presents respondents with various
scenarios each with its own unique
dilemma
respondents are then asked to choose how
they would want an algorithm to decide
so as a result we have 40 million
decisions
and they're still counting from people
all over the world
and it enables us to start analyzing
what do people agree on
but also how do they differ
[Music]
so does our culture influence our moral
judgments
people always agree on saving more lives
saving children saving people who cross
legally
over people who don't cross legally and
so on
the most interesting part is you could
pick a country
like germany yes and you could see how
they compared to the global average you
could see
ah okay so the status is not really
important but what you can see
in germany is preferring in action yeah
so if you don't have to
if you prefer to just go straight yes
which is the default
don't take a decision exactly this means
germans don't like to take a decision
yes
germans don't like other people
you say close your eyes and and go and
just go so so
this means in other words you can see a
bit the acceptance
of technology taking a decision
and the more you say inaction means
a comparison of germany and france
reveals cultural differences
the french tend to favor sparing women
and there's a stronger focus on children
and contrary to germans the french don't
want to leave things to fate
they want the machine to make the
decision
the machine is kind of a mirror for the
first time
something that you did subconsciously or
maybe instinctively in the case of an
accident you know you just
act randomly now you have to make a
conscious choice
and the machine is forcing you to make a
choice
right you cannot you cannot hand wave it
because in the end you have to program
something
driverless cars aren't yet ready for the
road and ethical questions
still abound artificial intelligence
harbors immense potential
to benefit daily life medicine or
mobility
but we also need to look beyond the
technical possibilities
what aim does such progress serve it's a
question
artificial intelligence algorithms can't
answer
only humankind can do that
[Music]
you
