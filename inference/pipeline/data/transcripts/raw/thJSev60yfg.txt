second,duration,transcript
0.56,2.48,in this video we will study about web
2.48,3.04,server
3.04,4.239,and application server and this video
5.52,3.36,will hopefully clear some of your doubts
7.279,2.32,regarding web server and application
8.88,4.24,server
9.599,7.041,so let's begin what is a web server
13.12,6.64,web server is a computer system
16.64,4.639,that hosts websites so what do you mean
19.76,4.96,by websites
21.279,7.281,it's a collection of web pages
24.72,6.479,so for example when you open amazon.com
28.56,4.8,it's a website and it does not have a
31.199,2.88,single web page but it has multiple web
33.36,3.359,pages
34.079,3.441,so when you open it you see the home web
36.719,2.961,page
37.52,3.199,but when you click on a product you will
39.68,3.6,be uh
40.719,4.32,taken towards a different web page that
43.28,3.36,will be the product web page
45.039,3.601,and there you will see multiple things
46.64,5.68,the image of the product info
48.64,7.68,and even recommendations so that means
52.32,5.12,website and then any computer system can
56.32,2.879,be a web server
57.44,3.04,what is the difference between a normal
59.199,3.68,computer system
60.48,3.44,and a web server so the difference is
62.879,3.201,that
63.92,3.84,this computer system is running a web
66.08,5.2,server software
67.76,5.76,for example apache http
71.28,3.92,web server this is the most popular one
73.52,4.88,today as of now
75.2,4.4,then we have microsoft iis and some
78.4,3.6,others
79.6,3.6,so is this the only difference that
82.0,3.84,computer system
83.2,4.32,and a computer system running web server
85.84,3.52,software
87.52,3.12,no there is one more difference and the
89.36,3.2,second is that
90.64,4.08,this computer system should be connected
92.56,4.32,to internet
94.72,3.2,in order to act as a web server
96.88,3.68,otherwise
97.92,3.68,uh clients web clients cannot contact it
100.56,3.36,through http
101.6,3.36,so it may not be able to it will not be
103.92,3.68,able to serve those
104.96,4.96,so it will not be acting as a web server
107.6,4.159,so it should be connected to internet
109.92,3.68,and it should be running a web server
111.759,4.161,software
113.6,3.839,so uh typically web servers host
115.92,3.6,multiple websites
117.439,4.081,some only host a few while others may
119.52,4.32,host several hundreds
121.52,3.12,but there are some dedicated servers
123.84,3.599,also
124.64,4.56,so based on that we will categorize a
127.439,5.281,web server
129.2,6.0,into two parts one is that web servers
132.72,6.96,that host websites for multiple users
135.2,4.48,these are called shared hosts
141.28,4.72,and there are some dedicated uh web
144.0,4.959,servers that will be hosting uh
146.0,5.92,websites for single person or company
148.959,2.961,and these will be called
152.08,5.439,dedicated hosts
155.2,3.679,so which servers are shared and which
157.519,3.841,are dedicated
158.879,3.761,so when let's say there is some personal
161.36,4.64,website
162.64,5.52,or some small websites which
166.0,3.44,does not have huge amount of traffic
168.16,4.0,then those who
169.44,3.76,would be uh generally hosted on shared
172.16,4.079,hosts
173.2,3.92,but uh if there is a huge website and it
176.239,4.0,has
177.12,6.56,a high traffic then that requires
180.239,5.201,a dedicated server for that and also if
183.68,4.0,the sites require custom server
185.44,5.68,modification then it will go for
187.68,6.4,dedicated hosts now uh let's understand
191.12,6.08,how this web server works
194.08,5.92,so if we have a web server let's
197.2,4.48,say this is the web server then there
200.0,4.319,must be a client
201.68,3.52,client whom the server is serving so we
204.319,4.48,will call it
205.2,8.64,web client so this client
208.799,5.041,sends an http request to the web server
214.239,5.201,and it will request for some page or it
217.04,4.0,will require for some other resources
219.44,3.439,so there are two possibilities one
221.04,6.0,possibility is that the
222.879,6.08,requested url the page that is requested
227.04,3.919,or the file that is requested
228.959,3.92,is present with the web server then it
230.959,6.721,will immediately send
232.879,7.121,a http response with the file
237.68,4.24,but it may be possible that that is not
240.0,4.959,present on the web server
241.92,6.16,so it can look into a static
244.959,4.401,database so these are files that is
248.08,6.719,present to this
249.36,7.68,then there may be also static database
254.799,3.361,which the web server can contact and
257.04,4.319,fetch the file
258.16,5.28,and return to the send http response but
261.359,5.361,there may be scenario that
263.44,4.88,this is not present in the staticdb but
266.72,3.28,it needs some processing
268.32,3.599,then what this web server will do is
270.0,5.36,that it will
271.919,5.681,send a servlet request to the
275.36,5.48,application server so you can now see
277.6,5.599,application server coming into
280.84,5.88,picture it will send a
283.199,6.241,servlet request
286.72,4.8,to application server so just a quick
289.44,4.72,info what is a servlet if you may be
291.52,5.28,wondering a servlet is a small java
294.16,4.96,program that runs with a web server
296.8,3.92,servlets receive and respond to requests
299.12,4.88,from web clients usually across
300.72,5.6,http so these will be some java programs
304.0,4.16,so it will require some processing so it
306.32,4.159,will send this servlet request
308.16,3.92,to this application server it will
310.479,5.521,contact the
312.08,6.8,application data store
316.0,3.919,in order to process run this servlet and
318.88,3.2,fetch some
319.919,3.28,details from here and do further
322.08,5.119,processing
323.199,7.121,and then it will send a servlet response
327.199,4.241,to the web server and now this web
330.32,4.319,server has the
331.44,4.4,response built in so response ready so
334.639,4.4,it can
335.84,5.68,send http response back to the
339.039,3.361,web client so this is how web server
341.52,2.8,works
342.4,3.92,and this application server may not be
344.32,4.879,always required but it may be required
346.32,5.84,when some intense processing is required
349.199,4.161,which web server cannot handle so this
352.16,3.84,is a
353.36,4.0,rough idea and you should understand
356.0,4.479,this flow
357.36,6.399,now let's see some of the examples of
360.479,6.081,web servers so one
363.759,3.761,most popular web server is apache http
366.56,3.759,server
367.52,3.6,and its most popular as of now it's
370.319,4.401,developed by
371.12,3.6,apache software foundation
376.96,4.4,and just a rough estimate roughly 60
380.319,4.0,percent
381.36,4.8,of the web servers run apache web server
384.319,4.241,and it can be installed on
386.16,3.84,all operating systems including linux
388.56,4.479,unix windows
390.0,5.44,freebsd mac ox osx and more
393.039,4.641,and it's a open source software so all
395.44,4.64,of these
397.68,3.92,are related to its popularity that's why
400.08,3.52,it's so popular
401.6,4.159,then we have internet information
403.6,5.68,services or in sort iis
405.759,6.801,it's developed by microsoft
409.28,4.479,and it runs on windows nt 2000 and 2003
412.56,3.28,platforms
413.759,3.041,and it is tightly integrated with the
415.84,4.24,operating system
416.8,6.0,so it is easy to administer it then we
420.08,5.6,have some other web servers like lite pd
422.8,3.519,sun java system web server and jigsaw
425.68,2.639,server
426.319,3.521,there are a few more but those are not
428.319,3.6,that much popular
429.84,3.68,now we have a good understanding of web
431.919,3.84,server we also know
433.52,3.6,the most popular web servers how web
435.759,3.681,server functions
437.12,4.639,now let's quickly look at application
439.44,4.56,server
441.759,4.0,so application server is a server that
444.0,4.4,is specifically designed to
445.759,3.28,run applications and here also we had
448.4,3.519,seen that
449.039,5.28,this was coming into picture when this
451.919,4.4,web server did not had the request ready
454.319,6.32,and it needed to run some
456.319,6.241,java program to build the response
460.639,3.041,so it's a server designed for running
462.56,2.96,applications
463.68,3.28,and it includes both hardware and
465.52,3.679,software that
466.96,3.04,provide an environment for programs to
469.199,3.041,run
470.0,3.84,so what are some of the uses of
472.24,3.76,application server
473.84,4.16,it's used for running web applications
476.0,5.36,hosting a hypervisor that manages
478.0,6.639,virtual machines so what are hypervisors
481.36,5.36,these are software programs that manage
484.639,3.68,one or more virtual machines and these
486.72,5.36,can be used to create
488.319,6.401,start stop and reset virtual machines
492.08,4.399,then application server can be used for
494.72,4.08,distributing and monitoring software
496.479,2.961,updates and also processing data sent
498.8,4.079,from
499.44,5.36,another server now next question is why
502.879,3.76,we use application server we already
504.8,2.88,have some idea why we use application
506.639,4.24,server
507.68,4.479,so a web server if you see is designed
510.879,3.761,and often optimized
512.159,3.281,to serve web pages and not more than
514.64,2.879,that
515.44,4.88,therefore it may not have the resources
517.519,5.121,to run demanding web applications
520.32,3.36,so an application server provides the
522.64,3.68,processing power
523.68,4.08,and the memory to run these applications
526.32,3.92,in real time
527.76,4.0,it also provides the environment to run
530.24,4.0,specific applications
531.76,4.32,for example let's say a cloud service
534.24,4.88,may need to process a data
536.08,3.04,on a windows machine
540.959,4.641,and a linux based server may provide the
543.12,4.0,web interface for the cloud service
545.6,3.2,but it cannot run the windows
547.12,4.56,application it can just provide an
548.8,3.92,interface therefore it may send the
551.68,3.279,input data
552.72,3.6,to a windows based application server so
554.959,5.201,this web server
556.32,6.72,is running on linux and it has some
560.16,5.6,interface with which the the client can
563.04,4.64,interact but it cannot process
565.76,4.079,uh something some application which can
567.68,3.12,only run on a windows so it has to
569.839,2.801,contact
570.8,4.479,the application server which will be
572.64,6.08,running on windows
575.279,6.321,and then it will run that application
578.72,4.239,therefore may it may send input data to
581.6,2.32,a windows based server and the
582.959,2.88,application
583.92,3.2,server can process the data and then
585.839,3.201,return the result
587.12,3.12,to the web server once processing is
589.04,4.239,done
590.24,5.68,and which can be output
593.279,5.601,as the form of result on a web browser
595.92,6.24,so it can be sent to the client
598.88,6.16,so you see that here it's necessary
602.16,3.919,it cannot do it cannot be done on the
605.04,3.52,web server
606.079,3.521,so this is some intuition why we need
608.56,2.959,application server
609.6,3.919,just one of the reasons is that it
611.519,4.56,provides the environment
613.519,4.641,to run a specific application web server
616.079,4.88,may not have that environment
618.16,4.56,and it's more powerful it provides
620.959,5.44,processing power
622.72,6.08,memory as well as environment
626.399,4.161,so i hope i was able to clear your some
628.8,2.8,of your doubts regarding web server and
630.56,3.279,application server
631.6,2.239,thank you
