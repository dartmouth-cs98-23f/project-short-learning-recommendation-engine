0.09,4.32,"this is a quantum computer! my friend Marques and 
I got to go see it when we visited IBM recently.  "
4.41,4.32,"quantum computers are crazy and they have the 
potential to change what we can do with computers  "
8.73,4.56,"but they're not just a better faster version of 
the kinds of computers that we use now. they're  "
13.29,3.36,"something really different and they're good for 
different things. here's an analogy that helped  "
16.65,3.78,"me understand this... imagine that you're 
on a video game map and how you get around  "
20.43,5.1,"depends on how good you are at doing math. not 
having a computer is like walking. so you can  "
25.53,4.5,"discover a lot but it takes forever. but then we 
invented computers and they're like cars. we can  "
30.03,3.3,"get farther faster than we could before. and 
our computers kept getting better and better  "
33.33,4.98,"so our cars kept getting faster and faster. but 
quantum computers aren't faster cars. think of  "
38.31,5.76,"them instead like boats. a boat isn't better or 
worse than a car. it's just built for a different  "
44.07,3.48,"terrain. with quantum computers we're starting 
to be able to navigate different mathematical  "
47.55,4.26,"waters and find solutions that our traditional 
computers just can't. I made a longer video  "
51.81,4.02,"about what exactly we're expecting to find in 
these waters and how quantum computers might  "
55.83,3.66,"actually impact our lives. so go watch it and if 
you like optimistic tech videos follow for more."
