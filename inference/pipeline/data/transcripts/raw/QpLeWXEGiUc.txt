0.0,4.17,a quantum computer is not just a faster
1.92,4.169,computer it's the machine that can solve
4.17,4.349,problems that are completely intractable
6.089,4.831,by any modern computer no matter how
8.519,4.681,powerful but to really outperform a
10.92,4.53,supercomputer the quantum computer must
13.2,5.01,be built using many quantum bits or
15.45,4.95,qubits all individually controlled and
18.21,5.37,coupled to each other in a larger array
20.4,5.4,our team at UNSW has already established
23.58,4.83,the record of performance for single
25.8,4.549,qubits in the solid state i'll cubital
28.41,4.739,individual atoms of phosphorous
30.349,5.14,implanted inside a silicon chip very
33.149,4.741,similar to those that power all modern
35.489,4.621,computers and smartphones we've made
37.89,4.739,qubits out of both the electron and the
40.11,5.19,nucleus of the phosphorus atom but
42.629,4.59,because they are atomic size systems you
45.3,4.169,would normally need to place them a few
47.219,4.471,atoms apart so that the electrons touch
49.469,4.381,each other to perform quantum
51.69,4.59,calculations we have now discovered that
53.85,4.29,this is not necessary we can make the
56.28,4.259,phosphorus qubits talk to each other
58.14,4.41,over much larger distances at one
60.539,3.991,condition that we encode quantum
62.55,5.249,information in the combined state of the
64.53,5.19,electron and the nucleus for example we
67.799,4.651,encode a zero in the electron down
69.72,5.219,nucleus at combination and a one in the
72.45,5.7,electron up nucleus down we called it
74.939,5.281,the flip-flop qubit it is operated by
78.15,4.469,pulling the electron away from the
80.22,4.62,nucleus and then oscillating the
82.619,4.89,electron position around its equilibrium
84.84,5.25,point this means that we can now control
87.509,5.101,a qubit in silicon using electric
90.09,4.65,instead of magnetic signals this makes
92.61,4.469,it much easier to integrate with normal
94.74,4.14,electronic circuits and once negative
97.079,3.561,charge of the electron is pulled away
98.88,5.19,from the positive charge of the nucleus
100.64,6.04,the qubit creates an electric field that
104.07,4.53,reaches over large distances so we can
106.68,4.38,now design a large-scale quantum
108.6,4.86,computer where there is plenty of space
111.06,5.19,to insert interconnects control lines
113.46,5.13,and read out devices without having to
116.25,5.1,fabricate components at the scale of a
118.59,4.77,few atoms this is a major shift in the
121.35,4.92,way we can build silicon quantum
123.36,5.099,computers using flip-flop qubits instead
126.27,4.799,of normal qubits will allow us to
128.459,4.281,manufacture large arrays of qubits
131.069,3.251,without having to push
132.74,4.2,the limits of fabrication of
134.32,4.93,conventional electronic devices so it's
136.94,4.62,a quicker and more economical way to
139.25,4.38,build a quantum computer that is big
141.56,4.1,enough to start having an impact in the
143.63,2.03,world
