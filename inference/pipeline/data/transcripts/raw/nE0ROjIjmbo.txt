8.639,5.201,data analyst versus data engineer versus
10.719,4.481,data scientist which one to choose
13.84,3.519,this is one of the most popular
15.2,4.64,questions asked by learners looking for
17.359,4.561,a career in data and analytics
19.84,4.16,i'm sure youtube would have come across
21.92,3.76,these job roles in the ever-growing data
24.0,3.92,science landscape
25.68,4.48,though they all deal with data these
27.92,4.0,jobs are not the same there are
30.16,3.919,significant differences between what a
31.92,3.6,data analyst data engineer and a data
34.079,3.281,scientist does
35.52,4.559,we will look at these job roles and the
37.36,4.4,differences in detail
40.079,3.281,first
41.76,3.68,let's look at some data analytics and
43.36,3.76,data science trends
45.44,3.36,the analytics and data science smart
47.12,4.24,data is thriving
48.8,4.8,data analytics data engineering and data
51.36,3.92,science are the key trends in today's
53.6,4.16,accelerating market
55.28,5.52,as per statista.com
57.76,5.84,global big data analytics market revenue
60.8,5.2,will grow at a cagr of 30 percent with
63.6,5.839,revenue reaching over 68 billion us
66.0,3.439,dollars by 2025.
71.119,4.241,according to technavio
73.28,4.519,the enterprise data management market is
75.36,6.56,expected to increase by
77.799,5.441,64.08 billion us dollars by 2025.
81.92,3.36,as per
83.24,4.68,marketsandmarkets.com the big data
85.28,6.96,market size is projected to grow
87.92,5.8,from 162.6 billion us dollars in 2021
92.24,6.8,to
93.72,5.32,273.4 billion u.s dollars in 2026.
99.119,4.161,now another report from research drive
101.68,4.439,says that the data science platform
103.28,7.119,market is estimated to reach
106.119,6.521,224.3 billion us dollars by 2026.
110.399,4.08,so with so much data available and
112.64,3.68,companies making huge investments to
114.479,4.0,drive business and sites the job
116.32,4.159,opportunities for data analysts data
118.479,4.32,engineers and data scientists are going
120.479,4.32,to increase in 2022 and over the coming
122.799,3.28,years
124.799,2.801,now
126.079,3.281,let's learn the major differences
127.6,4.48,between data analyst versus data
129.36,3.68,engineer versus data scientist
132.08,3.6,so
133.04,2.64,who are they
136.319,4.721,a data analyst analyzes and interprets
138.879,4.561,vast volumes of data in order to extract
141.04,4.16,meaningful information out of it
143.44,3.28,they find solutions to a business
145.2,3.039,problem and make critical business
146.72,3.519,decisions
148.239,4.321,the insights provided by data analysts
150.239,3.921,are important to companies that want to
152.56,4.08,understand the needs of their end
154.16,4.079,customers
156.64,3.76,now talking about
158.239,4.64,who a data engineer is
160.4,4.559,a data engineer on the other hand builds
162.879,4.401,infrastructure and scalable pipelines to
164.959,4.321,manage the flow of data and prepare it
167.28,4.72,for analysis
169.28,4.319,so basically they optimize the systems
172.0,3.28,that enable data analysts and data
173.599,4.321,scientists to perform their job
175.28,2.64,efficiently
178.879,3.921,data scientists are professionals who
180.8,3.84,analyze and visualize existing data and
182.8,4.32,use algorithms to build predictive
184.64,4.48,models for making future decisions
187.12,3.759,they also engage with business leaders
189.12,4.72,to understand their needs and present
190.879,2.961,complex findings
194.159,4.321,with that let's look at the primary
196.08,5.519,roles and responsibilities of
198.48,3.119,these three job roles
202.56,5.36,data analysts are responsible to collect
205.2,4.56,clean store and process data
207.92,4.08,they discover hidden patterns from data
209.76,4.16,by performing exploratory data analysis
212.0,3.28,and visualize data by creating charts
213.92,2.959,and graphs
215.28,4.319,acquiring data from primary and
216.879,4.321,secondary sources is one of their key
219.599,3.441,tasks
221.2,5.64,the build reports and dashboards and
223.04,3.8,also maintain databases
227.04,4.479,now talking about the roles and
228.64,4.72,responsibilities of a data engineer
231.519,2.961,a data engineer performs data
233.36,3.92,acquisition
234.48,4.16,the design build and test data as well
237.28,3.12,to develop and maintain data
238.64,4.64,architecture
240.4,5.36,data engineers are tasked with testing
243.28,4.48,integrating managing and optimizing data
245.76,3.52,from a variety of sources so they
247.76,3.759,integrate data into existing data
249.28,6.36,pipelines prepare data for modeling and
251.519,4.121,perform various etl operations
255.84,4.239,now talking about the roles and
257.199,5.28,responsibilities of a data scientist
260.079,4.241,so data scientists develop machine
262.479,4.081,learning models to identify trends in
264.32,4.56,data for making decisions
266.56,4.0,that develop hypothesis and use the
268.88,3.2,knowledge of statistics data
270.56,4.4,visualization and machine learning to
272.08,5.28,forecast the future for the business
274.96,4.4,data scientists visualize data and use
277.36,4.16,storytelling techniques and also write
279.36,4.48,programs to automate data collection and
281.52,2.32,processing
284.08,3.839,now move on to the skills possessed by
286.16,4.24,data analysts data engineers and data
287.919,2.481,scientists
290.8,3.839,to become a data analyst you need to
292.72,4.16,have good hands-on experience with
294.639,3.921,writing sql queries
296.88,4.08,you should have excellent microsoft
298.56,3.84,excel skills for analyzing data
300.96,3.2,data analysts are also good at
302.4,4.079,programming and they
304.16,4.4,need to know how to visualize data solve
306.479,5.041,business problems and possess domain
308.56,5.04,knowledge
311.52,4.16,data engineers should have a solid
313.6,3.92,understanding of sql mongodb and
315.68,3.76,programming
317.52,4.399,they need to have a good command of data
319.44,3.68,architecture scripting data warehousing
321.919,3.601,and etl
323.12,5.359,data engineers are also good at hadoop
325.52,4.959,based analytics
328.479,4.401,now talking about the skills for a data
330.479,4.081,scientist so a data scientist should
332.88,3.12,have experience with programming in
334.56,2.4,python and r
336.0,2.4,this would have a very good
336.96,3.36,understanding of mathematics and
338.4,3.92,statistics as well
340.32,3.36,data scientists need to possess
342.32,4.8,analytical thinking and data
343.68,3.44,visualization skills as well
347.28,3.359,machine learning deep learning and
349.12,5.519,decision making are other critical
350.639,4.0,skills every data scientist should have
355.68,4.16,now we look at the salaries of a data
358.0,4.639,scientist a data analyst as well as a
359.84,2.799,data engineer
363.199,4.241,so a data analyst in the united states
365.199,4.641,earns over seventy thousand dollars per
367.44,4.56,annum while in india a data analyst can
369.84,5.28,earn nearly seven lakh twenty five
372.0,3.12,thousand rupees per annum
376.24,3.76,a data engineer in the united states can
378.24,3.2,earn over hundred and twelve thousand
380.0,4.479,five hundred dollars
381.44,6.4,per year and in india you can earn over
384.479,3.361,nine lakh rupees per annum
387.919,4.161,we're talking about the salary of a data
389.52,5.6,scientist a data scientist in the united
392.08,5.679,states earns over 117 thousand dollars
395.12,7.199,per annum and in india a data scientist
397.759,4.56,can earn over 11 lakh rupees per annum
403.84,4.0,coming to the final section of this
405.68,4.56,video we look at the top companies
407.84,4.799,hiring for data analysts data engineers
410.24,3.92,and data scientists
412.639,3.68,so we have the
414.16,3.36,first company as google then we have
416.319,4.801,tesla
417.52,5.84,next we have the e-commerce giant amazon
421.12,4.0,the internet giant
423.36,5.119,facebook or the social media giant
425.12,6.96,facebook we have the tech giant oracle
428.479,5.601,we also have verizon and airbnb so these
432.08,4.72,are some of the top companies that hire
434.08,4.48,for the three roles
436.8,3.44,and that brings us to the end of this
438.56,3.84,video tutorial on
440.24,4.32,data analyst versus data engineer versus
442.4,3.359,data scientists if you have any queries
