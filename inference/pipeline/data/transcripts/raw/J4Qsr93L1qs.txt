1.12,2.88,when it comes to ai machine learning and
3.199,2.401,deep learning
4.0,3.359,there is some confusion as to what these
5.6,2.4,words mean and the differences between
7.359,2.881,them
8.0,4.0,so in this video we will explain what ai
10.24,4.319,means and how to differentiate between
12.0,4.88,these three terms
14.559,3.601,so what is artificial intelligence in
16.88,2.96,the broader sense of the word
18.16,3.52,artificial intelligence refers to a
19.84,3.12,machine that is made to simulate human
21.68,3.359,consciousness
22.96,3.68,when the average person thinks of ai
25.039,5.041,they imagine robots that can
26.64,6.48,see move speak think and possibly even
30.08,5.2,feel the way humans do for some
33.12,3.92,the ultimate goal of ai research is to
35.28,3.2,create a sentient conscious being
37.04,3.6,through programming
38.48,5.12,sometimes this is also referred to as
40.64,5.36,artificial general intelligence
43.6,4.639,however in practice most data scientists
46.0,4.399,are using ai at a smaller more practical
48.239,4.48,scale to solve real-world problems
50.399,3.84,such as data analysis manufacturing and
52.719,3.84,customer service
54.239,3.761,in that sense ai is the umbrella term
56.559,3.441,for technology that solves
58.0,3.92,problems autonomously by simulating
60.0,3.76,human intelligence
61.92,3.92,they do this through algorithms designed
63.76,3.679,to analyze input data and produce an
65.84,3.68,output
67.439,3.841,using chatbots for example the input
69.52,3.36,data would be the customer's inquiry
71.28,3.199,and the output would be the answer to
72.88,3.76,the customer's inquiry held within the
74.479,3.68,chatbots database
76.64,3.68,what's more amazing is that ai
78.159,3.461,algorithms can react to input data in
80.32,2.479,various forms
81.62,2.94,[Music]
82.799,3.201,a great example is how you would ask a
84.56,3.199,virtual assistant like amazon
86.0,3.6,alexa or google assistant for the
87.759,3.201,weather report there are multiple ways
89.6,3.199,that you can phrase that query
90.96,3.36,for example what's the weather what's
92.799,2.481,the temperature or even how's the
94.32,2.72,weather looking
95.28,3.44,but by picking up on certain keywords
97.04,3.36,the virtual assistant can respond to all
98.72,3.6,these different variants
100.4,4.48,the current weather is 23 degrees
102.32,4.96,celsius with clear skies
104.88,4.72,so if that's the definition of ai then
107.28,3.76,how is machine learning different
109.6,3.519,well machine learning is generally
111.04,3.84,considered to be a subset of ai
113.119,3.68,however it's pretty common to hear the
114.88,4.0,two terms used interchangeably
116.799,4.481,one major difference is that while ai
118.88,3.839,still encompasses the idea of a sentient
121.28,3.36,conscious machine
122.719,3.44,machine learning as a term does not hold
124.64,3.44,those connotations
126.159,4.08,ai is the grand vision of intelligent
128.08,3.12,machines while machine learning consists
130.239,3.521,of the models
131.2,4.48,processes and supporting technology that
133.76,4.0,we've been using to get there
135.68,3.919,diving a bit deeper now within machine
137.76,2.479,learning is another sector known as deep
139.599,2.561,learning
140.239,3.761,in a nutshell deep learning is machine
142.16,3.68,learning at the largest scale
144.0,3.84,involving millions of instances of
145.84,3.6,training data and often multiple layers
147.84,3.2,within the neural network
149.44,3.36,as computing power and access to
151.04,3.279,training data has increased
152.8,3.04,researchers have been able to develop
154.319,3.28,machine learning models on a larger
155.84,3.6,scale than ever before
157.599,3.521,eventually this led to the use of a new
159.44,3.36,term deep learning
161.12,3.199,to fully understand its meaning it's
162.8,3.2,essential to first know a little bit
164.319,3.601,about neural networks
166.0,4.08,simply a neural network is a collection
167.92,3.599,of algorithms designed to take in data
170.08,3.6,and find a solution with the least
171.519,4.161,amount of error they are called neural
173.68,3.839,networks because the design of the nodes
175.68,3.68,inputs and outputs which slightly
177.519,2.481,resemble that of a neuron in the human
179.36,2.64,brain
180.0,3.519,the key differentiator between machine
182.0,2.0,learning and deep learning is in the
183.519,2.401,number of
184.0,3.04,layers of nodes that the input data
185.92,2.8,passes through
187.04,3.44,in the past it was only possible to
188.72,4.0,connect a few layers of nodes
190.48,3.119,due to simple computing limitations
192.72,2.799,however as
193.599,3.92,technology has improved it has become
195.519,3.601,possible to build deeper neural networks
197.519,3.041,with more hidden layers
199.12,3.199,this is the kind of model the data
200.56,4.399,scientists mean when they talk about
202.319,2.64,deep learning
205.2,3.92,to sum things up ai is the grand
207.28,3.599,all-encompassing vision of intelligent
209.12,3.52,machines and machine learning is the
210.879,2.481,processes and tools that are getting us
212.64,2.239,there
213.36,3.36,finally deep learning is machine
214.879,3.761,learning at the largest scale with more
216.72,3.92,sophisticated neural networks
218.64,4.319,exponentially larger data sets and
220.64,4.08,stronger computing power supporting it
222.959,3.761,with this in mind it's possible to begin
224.72,2.72,navigating through this complex exciting
226.72,2.56,field
227.44,3.66,and figuring out which processes will
229.28,3.36,help to build out your own project
