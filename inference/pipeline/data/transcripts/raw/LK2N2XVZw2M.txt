15.119,4.24,yeah you're listening to autodesk's
17.439,3.6,digital Builder podcast a show that
19.359,3.68,inspires construction professionals to
21.039,3.16,innovate and use technology to improve
23.039,3.281,how they build our
24.199,3.601,world I'm Eric Thomas and I've been
26.32,3.279,working in construction for nearly a
27.8,3.639,decade and now I have the privilege to
29.599,3.601,sit down with industry Trailblazers to
31.439,3.721,hear how they're solving construction's
33.2,4.8,biggest challenges and redefining the
35.16,2.84,future of the built
39.36,4.519,environment all right welcome to another
42.0,4.28,episode of Autodesk digital Builder
43.879,4.721,podcast we are coming to you live from
46.28,4.72,Autodesk University it is the first of
48.6,5.04,three days right now our first interview
51.0,4.92,for the week actually so I'm excited I
53.64,4.439,hope uh you are as well I'm sitting down
55.92,4.68,today with Tanya custus the director of
58.079,3.921,AI research with Autodesk today we're
60.6,4.48,going to talk a little bit about what
62.0,5.28,the heck AI is what ml is artificial
65.08,4.2,intelligence machine learning what those
67.28,4.36,impacts are and you know really leaning
69.28,3.96,in on the the concept of why those tools
71.64,3.76,are not scary and they're actually going
73.24,4.199,to be our friend moving forward so I'm
75.4,3.96,very grateful for uh Tanya to join me
77.439,3.281,today and uh you know dispel some of
79.36,2.96,those rumors Tanya how are you doing
80.72,3.48,today we're back at at you it's great
82.32,4.159,doing great yeah it's great to be here
84.2,4.959,there's so many people here it's
86.479,5.121,exciting to be back in Vegas yeah
89.159,4.28,there's a I'd say what thousands of
91.6,4.24,people staring at us right now so no big
93.439,3.881,deal or any pressure right now I'm
95.84,3.08,really excited to build on what we did
97.32,3.119,last year at AES University in New
98.92,3.12,Orleans and so we're going to have a
100.439,3.36,super fun conversation and we're going
102.04,3.56,to get into the thi of it so can you
103.799,4.64,tell me a little bit more what does your
105.6,4.559,team do at Autodesk because it's it's
108.439,2.881,incredibly interesting and I'd really
110.159,3.721,love if you could kind of give an
111.32,4.839,overview of your role as AI research
113.88,6.0,lead so my team does fundamental and
116.159,5.721,applied AI research so we um extend and
119.88,4.48,Advance the state-of-the-art in Ai and
121.88,5.4,machine learning and you know in areas
124.36,5.319,that can be applied to Autodesk products
127.28,4.8,um doing computer science research uh
129.679,4.361,doesn't look that interesting um we're
132.08,4.84,not like it's not like a chemistry lab
134.04,3.88,with um lab coats or anything but you
136.92,2.76,know it's a lot of people in front of
137.92,5.08,computers running
139.68,6.16,experiments and um we do a lot of
143.0,8.12,research on deep learning and generative
145.84,6.72,AI for 3D 2D and C geometry you've got a
151.12,2.96,robust amount that you're covering your
152.56,3.2,team's doing some really cool stuff
154.08,3.879,which is is great and I think it gives
155.76,4.08,us a fantastic foundation for the rest
157.959,3.28,of our conversation to kind of do away
159.84,4.399,with those myths that we were talking
161.239,5.08,about but the the media cycle is is a
164.239,4.0,buzz right now about the impact of
166.319,4.321,artificial intelligence and I think
168.239,5.08,that's been growing for months and I was
170.64,5.16,hoping you could give me some context
173.319,3.681,why is this explosion of AI media
175.8,4.359,happening and what do these what do
177.0,4.959,these tools do right so why now um I've
180.159,3.681,been doing this for the last 15 years
181.959,5.0,and let me tell you no one has ever been
183.84,4.72,interested in what I do until now um my
186.959,3.521,parents have not understood what I've
188.56,7.0,done till now um I deal with that all
190.48,9.6,the time so um you know this isn't new
195.56,6.84,okay the math isn't new um AI is not new
200.08,5.12,it's it's more that we've reached this
202.4,4.64,kind of Tipping Point where data is in
205.2,5.319,the cloud it's in a place where we can
207.04,5.72,run compute on it and so the collocation
210.519,4.881,of data and compute is super important
212.76,5.8,to why we're seeing this now but then
215.4,6.039,also the side you know which leads to
218.56,6.52,the size of the models and they be have
221.439,6.08,become useful to people they become
225.08,4.359,almost humanlike so they've they've
227.519,4.0,become interesting like previously they
229.439,3.44,were not so interesting yeah they've
231.519,4.241,come to a point where they can help
232.879,5.041,people save time and so you know like 10
235.76,4.52,years ago I worked um at a place where
237.92,4.84,we were generating summaries
240.28,5.679,of legal legal briefs and legal cases
242.76,5.96,the editors took more time to fix the
245.959,5.881,garbage the computer generated then it
248.72,5.439,took them to just write things but now
251.84,4.519,we're at that Tipping Point where you
254.159,5.36,can generate something and the editor
256.359,5.921,can save time by just editing that thing
259.519,4.561,that the computer generated so that's
262.28,3.639,why now you know it's it's such a great
264.08,5.28,inflection point too and I'm hearing
265.919,5.921,more folks talk about Ai and our data
269.36,5.839,and managing their data in a in a really
271.84,5.28,robust way that I wasn't hearing 2 3 4
275.199,3.321,years ago and I think the light bulb is
277.12,3.2,starting to turn on people are starting
278.52,3.84,to understand as you just alluded to
280.32,4.319,like this is going to save me time this
282.36,4.52,is going to make a big impact on the
284.639,4.161,work that I do in my business and so
286.88,3.879,there's there's just a lot happening
288.8,3.399,right now and I'm excited I'm glad that
290.759,4.481,you're excited and your team's doing so
292.199,5.56,much fantastic work but could you dive
295.24,4.64,into that ambiguity Gap a little bit for
297.759,4.201,me right now so I think a lot lot of the
299.88,3.759,challenge that we deal with is folks
301.96,4.36,don't necessarily understand what these
303.639,4.361,different tools and Technologies do and
306.32,3.56,that is the Catalyst for the anxiety
308.0,2.88,that folks are feeling and so I'd love
309.88,3.28,it if you could you know lift the
310.88,3.92,curtain a little bit and give a high
313.16,4.0,level overview of you know what
314.8,4.08,artificial intelligence is what machine
317.16,3.2,learning is and you know what large
318.88,2.84,language models are because I think that
320.36,3.36,buzzword is starting to show up more
321.72,4.4,often now too definitely definitely is
323.72,4.64,um so generally we will Define
326.12,4.72,artificial intelligence AI as
328.36,4.92,capabilities that are being done by a
330.84,5.52,computer that are typically thought of
333.28,5.44,as being done by a human Okay so tasks
336.36,4.16,that a human usually does they're being
338.72,4.4,done by a computer so it's a pretty wide
340.52,6.36,definition um machine learning is a
343.12,7.16,subset of AI so not all AI is machine
346.88,6.319,learning but machine learning is all
350.28,6.88,AI the layer Nuance is exciting and
353.199,5.761,machine learning is when we learn we use
357.16,5.479,the computer learns from data so it's
358.96,6.48,learning patterns and probabilities and
362.639,6.041,and other information from the data
365.44,5.56,itself like classification things um
368.68,4.68,recommendation algorithms a lot a lot of
371.0,4.199,things you see every day are just simple
373.36,3.239,you know machine learning large language
375.199,5.321,models
376.599,7.281,are models built with machine learning
380.52,6.399,and they are built on huge amounts of
383.88,4.64,data and what they are trained to do the
386.919,5.361,training objective of large language
388.52,7.64,models is is to predict the next word
392.28,5.72,which sounds so boring um however when
396.16,4.96,you can do that and you can do it at
398.0,5.039,scale you also get a ton of other tasks
401.12,4.079,for free you get things like question
403.039,5.081,answering summarization um even
405.199,6.161,answering like math problems so you know
408.12,5.72,there's that scale is something that I
411.36,5.239,think surprised all of us um because we
413.84,5.639,had never trained at that scale before
416.599,5.04,we can use it for almost anything that
419.479,4.241,we use traditional machine learning for
421.639,4.721,like classification and and things like
423.72,6.479,that so yeah it's a really really
426.36,5.16,interesting place to be um but but again
430.199,3.28,they're not perfect they don't do
431.52,4.679,everything and they literally only
433.479,5.921,predict the next word it's they also
436.199,5.961,sound very confident so psychologically
439.4,5.28,you would really like to believe them
442.16,5.0,but they literally know nothing they
444.68,5.199,know no facts what they are exceedingly
447.16,5.52,good at large language models is
449.879,5.76,syntax linguistic syntax so like
452.68,4.799,structure of language and and there's so
455.639,3.68,much there especially with the the way
457.479,3.321,that I can learn from data and when I
459.319,4.16,talk to construction folks on the
460.8,4.6,regular I I really lean in on Data
463.479,4.16,standards and being really intent with
465.4,3.68,the way they capture the data because
467.639,3.481,that impacts everything you're talking
469.08,3.88,about so heavily as you start building
471.12,3.32,on that it's the garbage in garbage out
472.96,3.199,you know acronym where everybody goes
474.44,3.96,okay well you you know put everything in
476.159,4.121,at random and you know you're going to
478.4,3.199,get random back out if you're not you
480.28,3.84,know being very deliberate about how you
481.599,4.32,set that up and so I think it it really
484.12,3.639,is an exciting moment for our industry
485.919,3.761,because we're we're starting to step
487.759,3.601,back and say okay where where does this
489.68,3.84,get to augment what we're doing where
491.36,3.679,can it make improvements and I think
493.52,5.2,that's where I really like to emphasize
495.039,6.081,with folks that this isn't the the scary
498.72,4.0,Skynet that's coming at you right now
501.12,3.799,we're we're at this opportunity where
502.72,4.199,you say Okay a computer can do something
504.919,3.72,at scale that I can't do as a person or
506.919,4.0,can do it much more quickly and now I
508.639,3.96,get to go home at five instead of seven
510.919,4.12,or I get to go do something else and
512.599,5.36,100% you know that's that that feels a
515.039,5.401,lot better than this weird big brothery
517.959,4.481,Vibe of somebody watching everything
520.44,3.64,you're doing like that's not the value
522.44,3.72,and that's not what people are doing no
524.08,4.72,and honestly computers really are quite
526.16,4.72,stupid or I would not have a job so you
528.8,5.12,know they they don't learn what you
530.88,4.28,don't teach them number one and a lot of
533.92,4.4,the
535.16,5.96,Skynet you know Terminator scenarios
538.32,4.84,thanks movies yeah are are from movies
541.12,4.6,and it's also a little bit of like
543.16,4.76,psychological projection right so
545.72,4.239,whenever someone is afraid of like AI
547.92,4.08,doing bad stuff I'm like well what bad
549.959,4.841,stuff are you going to do you know no
552.0,5.399,Tech is neutral and it's the people
554.8,4.84,behind it that you know do bad stuff
557.399,4.841,right so like databases you could use
559.64,4.4,those for a lot of bad things but again
562.24,5.08,it's not the database's fault but we
564.04,5.239,tend to anthropomorphize Ai and sort of
567.32,5.6,like treat it like it's a person a
569.279,6.081,little bit and so there is a weird um
572.92,5.72,psychological aspect to it as well but
575.36,4.8,but honestly like AI is very not scary
578.64,2.879,yeah and and I feel like everything
580.16,3.08,you're sharing right now there there's a
581.519,3.0,bit of a confirmation bias in there too
583.24,3.2,where you go oh the bad thing happened
584.519,4.44,and we noticed but how many times was
586.44,3.68,the technology leveraged perfectly where
588.959,3.0,nothing happened and it was just the
590.12,4.36,most boring thing ever but you got to go
591.959,5.161,home at 5 and if it's intuitive yeah if
594.48,4.64,it's if it makes sense to you you don't
597.12,3.92,notice it right like yeah like every
599.12,4.399,every predictive texting suggestion you
601.04,4.919,get you know 99 out of 100 are great and
603.519,4.161,then you get one that's really weird and
605.959,4.281,then you like laugh at how bad the
607.68,4.12,algorithm is yeah okay yeah you're happy
610.24,3.24,with your Google home mini until it's
611.8,3.8,you know doing the wrong thing and then
613.48,3.799,you're yelling at it or at least I am in
615.6,3.6,my house don't tell anybody about that
617.279,4.761,one but i' I'd like to move a little bit
619.2,4.319,on into uh generative AI because that's
622.04,3.84,another topic that comes up fairly
623.519,4.721,regularly so can you tell me what what
625.88,3.44,the heck is generative Ai and and what
628.24,3.64,role does it have with in the
629.32,6.04,construction industry just with AI
631.88,5.88,generally um in the past traditional AI
635.36,3.84,we've been encoding things so we've been
637.76,3.56,taking a lot of information and kind of
639.2,3.439,compressing it down and encoding it now
641.32,3.959,what we're doing is we're taking those
642.639,5.681,encodings and decoding them and in so
645.279,5.041,doing it generates things okay so so
648.32,4.6,it's sort of just like The Logical next
650.32,6.319,step of figuring out how to do stuff
652.92,6.28,with AI generative AI is when you put in
656.639,4.961,a prompt and that prompt could be you
659.2,4.68,know a word it could be a phrase it
661.6,4.88,could be part of a drawing it could be
663.88,4.44,you know an image whatever right and
666.48,4.64,then the output of the algorithm
668.32,4.24,actually generates the output for you so
671.12,4.08,it's not like search where it's just
672.56,4.76,finding the output it's actually you
675.2,4.28,know generating so we see it a lot with
677.32,5.68,um language models like we were talking
679.48,5.76,about so chat gbt right can um you know
683.0,6.04,you give it a question it generates an
685.24,5.92,answer you um give it a couple articles
689.04,3.239,and it will generate a summary for you
691.16,3.28,that's what we're seeing and I think
692.279,4.521,we'll see it more and more because
694.44,4.28,generating things saves people time we
696.8,4.76,can take pictures of a construction site
698.72,5.239,and generate possible code violations
701.56,4.92,here's a drawing and it can generate you
703.959,5.641,know try these materials right so so
706.48,5.44,there's anything where you kind of you
709.6,4.039,know yeah generate anything namesake
711.92,3.44,makes sense when you start digging a
713.639,3.601,little bit in but you know anybody in
715.36,3.279,construction now it it makes so much
717.24,3.719,sense to think about these tools in
718.639,4.561,their application because is the the
720.959,5.361,labor shortages are not going away and
723.2,5.52,anything that we can do to improve how
726.32,4.92,our teams are able to go to work and do
728.72,5.239,things at scale with less time and
731.24,4.64,increasingly less resources available is
733.959,3.641,a huge win and so I'm really excited to
735.88,3.48,start seeing you know all these shifts
737.6,3.32,and all the buzz but we have to
739.36,3.8,obviously parse what's real and what
740.92,4.2,isn't as we kind of get into it but i
743.16,4.08,I'd like to take a look at uh some of
745.12,3.8,the exciting announcements that came out
747.24,3.64,today during our keynote so I know
748.92,3.76,Andrew shared some exciting things can
750.88,3.56,you share your reaction to some of these
752.68,3.0,developments and the the impacts that
754.44,3.399,they're going to bring to Autodesk
755.68,4.12,customers yeah absolutely I mean I think
757.839,4.961,the the takeaways at least from my
759.8,5.8,standpoint today were one you know we
762.8,6.12,have been doing AI yeah this this isn't
765.6,7.599,new so it's not new um but you know
768.92,6.8,looking more at how do we leverage and
773.199,6.08,sort of sew that AI together into an
775.72,6.44,open platform um you know that approach
779.279,5.441,is so important because data is so
782.16,6.119,important and you can't do AI without
784.72,6.64,data but also capturing the workflow and
788.279,5.321,how the data moves through the workflow
791.36,3.56,is is also just such an important part
793.6,3.16,of AI because you're again you're
794.92,3.44,predicting things so you want to be able
796.76,3.68,to predict what's next and you can't
798.36,3.8,predict what's next if you don't know
800.44,3.639,what the next thing that's going to
802.16,4.119,happen is like in the design workflow
804.079,4.841,for example the importance of context
806.279,5.201,also so like what Amy was talking about
808.92,5.479,with um importing different contexts and
811.48,5.039,contextual information again that is so
814.399,4.521,important to you know the more the more
816.519,4.041,data you give the computer the more it
818.92,3.32,I'm not going to say understands but the
820.56,4.68,better it can predict you know and
822.24,5.32,thinking about um how we use AI at
825.24,4.64,different levels right so we can use AI
827.56,4.839,for analysis right so that's you know I
829.88,5.16,have a lot of data I aggregated it and I
832.399,5.401,learned these really interesting things
835.04,4.76,right like that is great and you know
837.8,4.44,but beyond that we can automate things
839.8,4.2,right so boring things that designers
842.24,3.719,don't want to do or that that take them
844.0,3.04,a lot of time and then beyond that like
845.959,3.68,you were talking about before
847.04,5.919,augmentation so like that's the ultimate
849.639,5.521,goal right like we want to make the
852.959,3.88,computer better but we also want to make
855.16,3.799,the human better right so like peanut
856.839,4.961,butter and chocolate right all of those
858.959,4.721,things sort of build on each other and I
861.8,3.76,think you know Andrew did a good job of
863.68,3.079,of sort of setting it up that way and
865.56,2.719,and we don't want to take the humanity
866.759,3.0,out of what we're doing as well like
868.279,2.721,absolutely you see a lot of the buzz in
869.759,3.401,the news right now where somebody goes
871.0,4.16,oh we're gonna you know AI music and
873.16,3.4,everything else it's like no like we
875.16,2.919,want to automate the things people don't
876.56,3.639,want to do so I can go sit on a beach
878.079,3.76,and play music instead of you know doing
880.199,3.721,some middle drawing you know takeoffs
881.839,4.321,for 19 years or whatever it happens to
883.92,3.88,be ex and you know AI it's it's a how
886.16,4.84,not a what so we talk about like I want
887.8,5.32,to do AI like okay but what do you want
891.0,5.32,what problem are you solving right and
893.12,5.04,AI honestly is not always the answer
896.32,3.879,it's not always the best way to solve a
898.16,4.64,problem and so you know it's a really
900.199,6.241,important tool in a modern software
902.8,5.76,engineering toolbox but you know you
906.44,4.68,need to use it when it's right and when
908.56,4.48,it's appropriate and I think you know
911.12,4.68,obviously people want to use it because
913.04,4.44,it's cool and fun but you know there's
915.8,3.479,there's a lot of problems you don't need
917.48,3.479,it for either yeah absolutely I think
919.279,3.68,that's where that the hype narrative
920.959,3.601,comes up a little bit sometimes we go I
922.959,3.32,think every technology company
924.56,3.399,regardless of what industry they're in
926.279,3.761,in the last six months has announced
927.959,3.88,something with I and it's just like well
930.04,3.599,does that really do anything for your
931.839,3.12,customers or did you think that that was
933.639,3.041,important for round you know raising
934.959,4.36,your series B round or something right
936.68,5.159,and I mean so ultimately a new product
939.319,4.96,should address like a either a customer
941.839,4.8,need you haven't addressed in the past
944.279,4.841,or you know we have plenty of products
946.639,5.721,that we could just you know replace the
949.12,5.0,guts of with AI and improve them right
952.36,4.599,and and in those cases maybe you won't
954.12,5.04,notice and maybe that's good that you
956.959,3.601,don't notice right because it's working
959.16,3.359,yeah sometimes that's okay if it's in
960.56,3.8,the background it's just amplifying the
962.519,3.44,workflows that you have but I think I
964.36,3.24,think that leads into my next question
965.959,4.0,actually can you talk a little bit about
967.6,5.039,the the real risks that might you know
969.959,4.161,come from introducing AI technology and
972.639,3.481,how the teams that are developing the
974.12,3.44,tools are really making sure that
976.12,5.76,they're protecting our friends working
977.56,6.519,in a first of all a data right so like
981.88,4.56,you said garbage in garbage out making
984.079,6.44,sure that you have the right data to
986.44,6.199,train the right use cases so important
990.519,4.361,there are a lot of things we're learning
992.639,4.721,about different kinds of data right we
994.88,4.24,don't have all the answers um sometimes
997.36,5.0,processing data one way will lead to
999.12,6.04,better results sometimes you know that
1002.36,4.56,there's there's a lot of Science and
1005.16,5.479,experimentation going on which is a lot
1006.92,5.8,of what my team does um but again it's
1010.639,5.281,looking at what's the right tool for the
1012.72,5.2,job there's always going to be danger in
1015.92,5.32,construction work what we're aiming for
1017.92,6.6,is to make it safer and using aii in
1021.24,5.799,ways that will make it safer so like
1024.52,5.88,augmentation maybe like seeing things or
1027.039,5.681,or patterns or trends that people are
1030.4,5.36,not seeing like what are the strengths
1032.72,6.0,of using AI for something and then you
1035.76,4.88,know using it correctly and I think not
1038.72,4.239,taking the human out of the loop is
1040.64,5.039,really important for things that are
1042.959,5.921,dangerous and we're also working um on
1045.679,6.561,my team to do a lot of AI alignment
1048.88,4.039,which is where we look at the output of
1052.24,3.64,the
1052.919,4.681,algorithms and we then kind of train
1055.88,6.0,secondary algorithms or use
1057.6,7.6,reinforcement learning to align them to
1061.88,6.0,what is either safer or people like
1065.2,4.68,better right um and you know so that
1067.88,3.4,that also is a really important tool for
1069.88,3.2,what we're doing in the safety
1071.28,4.08,conversations one that I I really like
1073.08,3.88,using it as an example actually because
1075.36,3.24,you think about it from you know a large
1076.96,2.92,project $200 million Construction
1078.6,3.24,project you've got your safety
1079.88,3.48,professionals on site they do their site
1081.84,4.28,walks they're looking for risks they're
1083.36,4.679,analyzing all these things technology
1086.12,3.84,can analyze these risks at a scale that
1088.039,4.241,a person can't do yeah and so if you're
1089.96,4.88,doing uh different types of scanning
1092.28,5.36,photography the technology can look for
1094.84,4.12,fall hazards or scaffolding issues
1097.64,3.039,that's not to say that your super
1098.96,3.44,shouldn't go out and do these site walks
1100.679,4.841,or anything because that human element
1102.4,4.92,is so important but what it means is
1105.52,4.0,you're just getting so much more
1107.32,4.68,opportunity to check and see if
1109.52,4.92,everything is safe and at a at a level
1112.0,4.039,that just a human just can't do it's
1114.44,3.76,just not possible it's processing more
1116.039,4.281,information for you yeah right so it's
1118.2,3.479,augmenting yep you and anybody on a
1120.32,2.56,construction site knows first thing you
1121.679,2.48,think about and last thing you think
1122.88,2.32,about is going to be safety so
1124.159,2.961,absolutely you know anything we can do
1125.2,3.56,to improve that is going to be great is
1127.12,3.64,there anything else that we can do to
1128.76,4.159,reduce some of these you know Common
1130.76,3.68,concerns that folks have or fears about
1132.919,4.24,these tools anything else that comes to
1134.44,5.8,mind um I mean a lot of what I do is
1137.159,5.441,just education right explain today right
1140.24,5.04,explaining to people that it's just math
1142.6,4.84,it's not scary um explaining to people
1145.28,5.44,that it's really the data that gives a
1147.44,5.4,company a competitive advantage in AI
1150.72,4.319,right so like Google and Bing if you
1152.84,4.52,look at both search engines you know
1155.039,4.681,Bing probably has better algorithm to be
1157.36,4.559,honest but Google has a lot more data
1159.72,4.959,right and so the data really is that
1161.919,5.281,competitive advantage and I think you
1164.679,5.36,know educating people how it works
1167.2,5.12,demystifying it is really important um
1170.039,4.921,but just you know transparency making
1172.32,4.719,sure people feel that their privacy is
1174.96,3.68,being protected or just when they're
1177.039,5.281,interacting with a tool being
1178.64,4.72,transparent that hey this this is AI
1182.32,3.04,right or this you know this
1183.36,4.52,recommendation was generated by a
1185.36,4.16,computer like and giving them choices
1187.88,3.84,right so here are a bunch of
1189.52,4.279,recommendations you can take them or not
1191.72,4.4,take them and that's totally cool and
1193.799,5.0,that's totally different than having it
1196.12,5.12,generate one answer
1198.799,4.36,and forcing them to use it right this is
1201.24,4.0,it we've seen when it makes mistakes and
1203.159,3.561,what it does you kind of back away and
1205.24,3.6,no thank you ex so a lot of it is like
1206.72,4.92,how do we interact with it in a design
1208.84,5.16,workflow especially even if you have
1211.64,4.48,another person generating something for
1214.0,4.6,you behind the scenes you probably don't
1216.12,4.919,want it or or don't love it as much as
1218.6,5.48,your own right and so you know it is
1221.039,6.12,about that choice and using the AI like
1224.08,5.64,a collaborator I think is will go a long
1227.159,4.041,way towards building trust I appreciate
1229.72,3.16,that and that that continued education
1231.2,3.12,and the conversation around it
1232.88,3.84,especially as it becomes more and more
1234.32,4.239,Buzzy I I think is incredibly important
1236.72,3.079,it's unfortunate almost that we've had
1238.559,2.521,all these Terminator movies and
1239.799,2.841,everything and somebody goes artificial
1241.08,2.959,intelligence they're coming like I wish
1242.64,3.519,I could have Arnold pop out right now or
1244.039,3.961,something join our conversation to help
1246.159,3.801,dissuade some of the uh the myths around
1248.0,3.32,it but sadly I called them a couple
1249.96,3.52,times and he wasn't available so we'll
1251.32,4.16,just have to roll solo but I've got a
1253.48,4.16,couple more questions for you today one
1255.48,3.679,more on AI can you can you tell me a
1257.64,3.32,little bit more more about the aspects
1259.159,4.681,of artificial intelligence that people
1260.96,4.76,are not talking about and they and what
1263.84,3.199,else should they be talking about like
1265.72,2.64,where are those gaps in the narrative
1267.039,4.921,right now that you're seeing sort of the
1268.36,5.96,no Tech is neutral situation right like
1271.96,4.16,again this is the next step of software
1274.32,5.2,engineering we've been using software
1276.12,6.0,for a long time right and so thinking of
1279.52,5.96,AI as something totally different than
1282.12,6.4,just using software I mean it's it's
1285.48,5.559,harmful but also a little naive um and
1288.52,5.639,you know just really people don't think
1291.039,4.76,enough about the data they don't think
1294.159,4.161,enough about you know they're like I
1295.799,4.521,want to do AI well like first you have
1298.32,4.04,to put your data in the cloud and that's
1300.32,4.2,probably boring and hard then you have
1302.36,5.28,to organize it in certain ways which
1304.52,5.44,again is like feels very remedial to
1307.64,4.159,people who want this big fireworks
1309.96,3.68,moment right they want it now yeah they
1311.799,4.641,want it now and and you know and a lot
1313.64,4.76,of AI is built on like smaller AI a lot
1316.44,5.119,of times the first thing things you're
1318.4,5.36,going to see out of using AI are I mean
1321.559,5.0,kind of boring there's a patient aspect
1323.76,6.24,to it there's the interface aspect right
1326.559,6.48,we're in control of how people interact
1330.0,6.039,with our AI making sure that the
1333.039,4.801,customers know that they're in control
1336.039,3.88,of their workflow that we're trying to
1337.84,4.0,help them we're not trying to replace
1339.919,4.201,them right I think all of those things
1341.84,4.439,are just super super important and
1344.12,4.559,there's no secret math right my team and
1346.279,4.4,I we publish a lot of papers
1348.679,5.161,and it's because the AI research
1350.679,7.24,Community is super open no one company
1353.84,5.6,has like some secret box of technology
1357.919,3.88,that hidden tool that we're all going to
1359.44,4.119,sneak in I mean no one does it is a very
1361.799,4.801,open conversation in the scientific
1363.559,5.641,Community I wish more people would learn
1366.6,5.12,about it so they're not afraid um but
1369.2,4.44,but yeah it's very open it's it's math
1371.72,3.839,honestly like are you afraid of math I
1373.64,3.8,mean kind of there there's a reason why
1375.559,4.321,I didn't go well I I abandoned
1377.44,5.28,engineering school just leave it at that
1379.88,4.76,all right well well I I appreciate that
1382.72,4.079,level set and and I think the point that
1384.64,3.8,you made about just the importance of
1386.799,3.841,you know just cleaning house with your
1388.44,3.92,data is huge we did a research report
1390.64,3.48,with FMI a couple years ago it was
1392.36,4.16,called harnessing the data advantage and
1394.12,5.08,construction and we really just leaned
1396.52,4.44,in on what folks were doing where were
1399.2,3.68,they concerned where were the success
1400.96,3.319,factors were and we found that a lot of
1402.88,3.159,people sit in a state of decision
1404.279,3.081,paralysis right now because they don't
1406.039,4.0,know where to start because it is
1407.36,5.04,overwhelming I I I have so much empathy
1410.039,4.801,for an organization especially a large
1412.4,4.44,one that hasn't standardized fully in a
1414.84,3.36,certain way and how they capture data or
1416.84,3.68,had the opportunity to think about what
1418.2,4.0,they want to do with their data which is
1420.52,3.2,I think the important part about where
1422.2,2.88,you start you got to go what what do you
1423.72,3.92,want to achieve you don't just start
1425.08,4.12,Gathering data madly exactly and when
1427.64,3.32,you think about that then you get to
1429.2,4.0,start identifying those little areas
1430.96,4.56,where you go okay where where is our TCH
1433.2,3.839,stack set up so well that making
1435.52,3.24,improvements on our data is going to
1437.039,3.52,have an impact with without as much of a
1438.76,3.44,burden you fix that and then you've got
1440.559,3.561,a win you get to show this to your team
1442.2,4.12,and you go look at this and now this
1444.12,3.559,cloud-based tool can figure this out
1446.32,3.28,what if we did this everywhere else and
1447.679,3.561,then you slowly start building if you
1449.6,3.52,try to boil the ocean with your entire
1451.24,4.0,data strategy and you've got none to
1453.12,3.08,start with it's a losing proposition
1455.24,2.76,because you're just going to be so
1456.2,3.44,overwhelmed got pick that Focus area
1458.0,4.039,absolutely again that sort of Paradigm
1459.64,4.56,of like analyze automate and then
1462.039,5.88,augment right like those go in in an
1464.2,6.52,order and they're you know progressively
1467.919,5.12,more thing you know more magnitude of
1470.72,5.36,things you can do with that data as you
1473.039,4.76,get it into shape for use so I think
1476.08,3.76,we're uh We've covered the gamut as far
1477.799,3.801,as high level on what the heck AI is and
1479.84,3.68,why you know people shouldn't be afraid
1481.6,3.92,of hanging out and uh you know
1483.52,3.519,installing some tool whether it's chat
1485.52,3.12,GPT or something there's a there's a
1487.039,3.441,myriad of things you can jump into and

1500.84,4.24,that you work on Creative problem
1503.08,4.719,solving I like it it's the number one
1505.08,4.56,thing I look for when I hire people um
1507.799,5.161,you know my my undergrad degrees is in

1522.039,3.081,I'm really glad that we're here yeah

1528.24,4.319,you know AI is inherently
1529.919,4.681,interdisciplinary and and it's you know
1532.559,3.761,the thing I use every single day I like
1534.6,3.679,it and I think the the creative Focus

1540.72,3.48,that what can we do what's possible
