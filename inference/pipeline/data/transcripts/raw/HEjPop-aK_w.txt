12.719,4.961,the most basic division of a computer
15.2,3.6,system is between the hardware and the
17.68,3.2,software
18.8,4.239,hardware is often described as the
20.88,4.399,physical parts of a computer that you
23.039,3.921,can actually touch with your hands
25.279,4.481,although that is not recommended
26.96,4.8,especially when the power is on
29.76,4.639,software includes all the programmed
31.76,4.88,instructions in a computer
34.399,5.041,there is the main program called the
36.64,5.2,system software also known as the
39.44,4.88,operating system which controls and
41.84,4.96,interacts with the hardware and software
44.32,5.28,components
46.8,5.439,application software are programs like
49.6,5.84,photoshop internet explorer
52.239,5.681,and world of warcraft
55.44,5.52,the main hardware components include the
57.92,4.4,cpu or central processing unit
60.96,3.68,main memory
62.32,6.4,secondary storage devices
64.64,4.08,and the input and output devices
71.52,5.2,the cpu is a microchip that receives and
74.0,6.56,decodes instructions from memory
76.72,6.48,within the cpu are specialized units
80.56,4.64,one is the arithmetic logic unit
83.2,3.52,this part performs operations with
85.2,3.68,numbers
86.72,5.439,the control unit manages the flow of
88.88,5.68,instructions in time of the cpu clock
92.159,4.401,the faster the cpu clock the more
94.56,3.599,instructions that can be processed at a
96.56,4.559,time
98.159,4.801,the processor i have is a quad core
101.119,4.401,that means that there are four copies of
102.96,3.439,the same transistor circuitry within one
105.52,4.08,chip
106.399,5.201,with four cores my processor can execute
109.6,6.24,four times as many instructions at a
111.6,4.24,time than if it only had one core
119.6,5.119,the main memory is volatile
122.159,5.28,that means whatever data is held here
124.719,5.6,would be lost if the power went off
127.439,6.001,volatile memory needs a constant flow of
130.319,6.161,electricity to work so it's only used
133.44,5.519,for instructions in active use
136.48,7.24,otherwise data is stored in a permanent
138.959,4.761,storage device like the hard drive
150.959,4.64,the main memory can be imagined as a
153.12,5.6,sequence of cells that are either empty
155.599,6.961,or contain instructions or data
158.72,6.239,each cell has its own unique address
162.56,3.6,in the actual hardware electrical
164.959,2.64,signals
166.16,4.48,on and off
167.599,7.521,represent all computer information
170.64,4.48,these on and off signals are called bits
178.08,4.879,the hardware of a computer is like a
180.4,5.28,kitchen it includes all the equipment
182.959,4.721,necessary for cooking food as well as an
185.68,4.88,energy source and location for
187.68,4.88,performing the processes of cooking
190.56,7.56,the kitchen is where the ideas of a
192.56,5.56,recipe are translated into edible meals
199.04,5.119,a recipe is like software
202.0,4.64,a recipe is just a series of written
204.159,4.641,instructions that tell you how to turn
206.64,3.679,raw ingredients into a culinary
208.8,4.32,masterpiece
210.319,5.28,by itself a recipe is a useless piece of
213.12,5.839,writing but as soon as the recipe is
215.599,5.761,interpreted and executed the recipe has
218.959,5.441,value as a functional tool that can be
221.36,4.239,used again and again to produce the same
224.4,4.479,result
225.599,8.36,software is reusable the instructions of
228.879,5.08,software control the flow of data
247.68,2.08,you
