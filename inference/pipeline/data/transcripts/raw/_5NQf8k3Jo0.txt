0.16,5.18,math might not offer the security you
1.92,6.52,need but physics might
5.34,3.1,[Music]
8.559,4.481,classical cryptography that encrypts
10.559,4.641,messages with mathematical equations is
13.04,3.999,secure enough for classical computing
15.2,3.44,but with the emergence of quantum
17.039,3.281,computing it may not be enough
18.64,4.32,protection that's where quantum
20.32,5.039,cryptography comes in it uses physics
22.96,4.88,instead of math here we'll talk about
25.359,4.32,why quantum cartography is so secure but
27.84,3.519,despite the advantages there are still
29.679,3.601,limits and challenges to quantum
31.359,4.241,cryptography and quantum key
33.28,4.24,distribution read about how one company
35.6,5.68,is tackling the quantum security front
37.52,3.76,in the link above or description below
43.28,4.959,quantum cryptography uses particles of
45.76,5.68,light or photons to transmit
48.239,6.561,cryptographic keys over fiber optic wire
51.44,4.799,the photons represent binary bits aka
54.8,3.599,zeros and ones
56.239,3.921,it's a completely secure system
58.399,3.201,because of these properties of quantum
60.16,3.44,mechanics
61.6,4.4,particles can exist in more than one
63.6,4.72,place or state at a time
66.0,4.799,a quantum property cannot be observed
68.32,5.92,without changing or disturbing it
70.799,5.521,and whole particles cannot be copied
74.24,5.68,quantum cryptography follows a model
76.32,6.72,developed in 1984 that goes like this
79.92,5.6,alice wishes to send bob a message alice
83.04,4.56,initiates the message sending bob a key
85.52,4.16,or stream of photons
87.6,5.12,but the photons first pass through a
89.68,4.32,polarizer polarizing each photon in a
92.72,2.56,certain state
94.0,4.0,horizontal
95.28,4.32,vertical diagonal to the right or
98.0,4.159,diagonal to the left
99.6,4.72,as bob receives the photons he doesn't
102.159,4.96,know the correct polarization so he
104.32,5.36,randomly uses one of two beam splitters
107.119,5.121,to read each photon's polarization and
109.68,4.88,decipher the key alice and bob can then
112.24,4.479,compare the splitter they used the
114.56,4.64,photons read with the wrong splitter are
116.719,3.921,discarded and the remaining sequence is
119.2,3.76,the key
120.64,4.479,if there is an eavesdropper present who
122.96,3.28,has the same tools as bob
125.119,3.2,they would not only have the
126.24,4.32,disadvantage of not being able to
128.319,4.0,compare their results with alice but
130.56,4.24,they would also change the photon
132.319,6.081,positions that alice and bob expect to
134.8,5.68,see so they would blow their cover
138.4,4.559,it's impossible to measure the quantum
140.48,5.92,state of a system without disturbing it
142.959,5.041,in theory qkd is unhackable after keys
146.4,3.76,are exchanged between the involved
148.0,4.16,parties there is little concern that a
150.16,4.4,malicious actor could decode the data
152.16,4.24,without the key what do you think
154.56,3.6,is quantum cryptography the answer to
156.4,3.28,the quantum computing threat
