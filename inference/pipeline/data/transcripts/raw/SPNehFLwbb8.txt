0.16,3.92,when public or private entities in a
2.159,4.16,city or region that manage critical
4.08,4.0,infrastructures for example hospitals
6.319,4.24,electrical plants or public
8.08,3.92,transportation use the internet to send
10.559,4.16,important information between their
12.0,4.24,headquarters and operation sites how can
14.719,3.201,they guarantee that they are not being
16.24,4.0,hacked or that nobody is trying to steal
17.92,4.72,the information that is transmitted in
20.24,4.08,most cases today we send information
22.64,3.84,through the internet where the security
24.32,3.6,of the net relies on different methods
26.48,2.879,one of them called public key
27.92,4.639,cryptography
29.359,5.681,in this method two keys are generated
32.559,4.241,a public key that is sent to one party
35.04,4.4,and a private key that remains with the
36.8,2.64,other party
39.52,3.76,the message is encrypted using the
41.2,4.48,public key and opened with the private
43.28,4.56,key the security of this method relies
45.68,4.08,on that the private key is secret and
47.84,4.0,only the party receiving the message has
49.76,4.16,access to it
51.84,4.64,the public and private keys are created
53.92,4.08,using different mathematical algorithms
56.48,3.36,the most famous is based on the
58.0,6.399,factorization of a large number into
59.84,4.559,prime numbers and it is known as rsa
64.479,3.68,it is quick to multiply two very large
66.479,3.201,numbers
68.159,3.361,but it takes a lot more time to
69.68,2.39,factorize a large number into prime
71.52,2.959,factors
72.07,4.729,[Music]
74.479,4.241,to hack rsa and obtain the private key
76.799,4.161,from the public key we would need to be
78.72,6.0,able to factorize a very large number
80.96,3.76,with more than 600 digits
85.04,5.759,no algorithm or machine is known today
87.36,5.2,that is able to do such a thing
90.799,5.521,it would take more than a million years
92.56,3.76,of computation time to solve
97.52,3.68,what happens if there was already a
99.28,4.799,secret algorithm that could break codes
101.2,4.72,really fast and no one knew
104.079,5.761,just like the rosetta stone those who
105.92,5.76,knew how to use it got the information
109.84,3.52,when quantum computers surpassed the
111.68,3.52,computational power of classical
113.36,4.0,computers they will be able to do
115.2,4.0,wonderful and useful things for us but
117.36,5.119,they will also be able to break codes
119.2,5.04,extremely fast 100 million times faster
122.479,3.521,than current computers
124.24,3.92,that is fast
126.0,4.0,today hackers could copy the encryption
128.16,3.52,key and the encrypted messages that are
130.0,3.68,sent over the internet without being
131.68,3.52,noticed
133.68,3.6,they could store the information and
135.2,4.88,decode the message when such algorithms
137.28,4.319,or quantum computers are available
140.08,3.28,the information that needs to be kept
141.599,4.0,secret for several years should be
143.36,4.4,protected now
145.599,4.321,quantum key distribution is an applied
147.76,4.72,encryption method based also on the laws
149.92,4.48,of quantum physics which uses quantum
152.48,4.16,random number generators to create a
154.4,4.08,completely secure key that is used only
156.64,4.4,once between two parties to share
158.48,4.56,information
161.04,4.4,the key is created by encoding its
163.04,4.24,random bits into photons and transmitted
165.44,5.12,via current telecom fiber optics
167.28,4.64,networks or even through free space when
170.56,4.24,the random key is sent through the
171.92,4.319,internet a hacker can intercept it but
174.8,3.92,when the hacker tries to retrieve the
176.239,4.241,information encoded into the photons he
178.72,4.159,or she will irreversibly change their
180.48,5.759,properties because quantum states cannot
182.879,3.36,be cloned or copied
186.4,3.839,measuring the photons that compose the
188.08,3.76,key could change the encoded information
190.239,3.681,and this would alert the parties that
191.84,4.56,someone has intercepted the call and the
193.92,6.72,key has been compromised so the key is
196.4,4.24,discarded and a new one is generated
200.879,4.64,having this random key and adding it bit
203.12,4.24,by bit your string of data is proven to
205.519,3.761,be an ultra secure method when
207.36,4.72,transmitting sensitive data between two
209.28,4.959,locations such as banks hospitals or
212.08,4.4,government buildings and providing
214.239,5.72,long-term protection of our data even to
216.48,3.479,quantum computers
234.64,2.08,you
