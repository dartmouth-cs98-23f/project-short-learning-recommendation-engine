1.36,4.64,you a creative individual trying to
4.16,3.92,develop an application
6.0,4.559,whether you're writing some code editing
8.08,4.4,a video or making the 3d model
10.559,3.761,there are many factors you may want to
12.48,4.0,consider sometimes
14.32,3.039,when designing we focus too much on the
16.48,2.879,visuals
17.359,3.121,in such a way where we design for
19.359,3.121,ourselves
20.48,3.92,rather than the user putting your
22.48,4.32,personality into what you create
24.4,4.639,is great as long as it doesn't interfere
26.8,4.16,with the user's journey
29.039,3.281,if you're on a computer take a look at
30.96,4.08,your mouse and keyboard
32.32,4.079,think about how these tools evolved over
35.04,3.92,the years
36.399,4.721,what has stayed the same why do you own
38.96,4.24,this particular pair
41.12,3.759,because of their color or because you
43.2,4.56,like the way they feel
44.879,3.52,it could be both but one thing is for
47.76,3.68,sure
48.399,5.361,everybody wants to be comfortable
51.44,4.56,but what is comfort can you design
53.76,5.119,something comfortable
56.0,3.68,the answer is yes with a number of
58.879,3.121,methods
59.68,5.119,human computer interactions can help you
62.0,5.6,develop a more user-friendly interface
64.799,4.401,and application it's the study and
67.6,4.559,collection of data
69.2,3.599,based on human factors focusing on
72.159,3.841,designing
72.799,6.081,cognitively for the users
76.0,3.52,all the senses especially sound sight
78.88,2.96,and touch
79.52,4.48,need to be considered measurements of
81.84,3.84,users how they identify
84.0,4.0,ensuring that your application is
85.68,4.479,inclusive for various types of users
88.0,3.04,is imperative to creating a more
90.159,4.481,user-friendly
91.04,4.32,experience but how and when can you
94.64,4.24,implement
95.36,5.2,hci it may vary depending on the service
98.88,3.84,or product you're developing
100.56,3.599,in this case let's say you're developing
102.72,3.759,a website
104.159,3.761,if you're an experienced designer then
106.479,2.241,you can probably go ahead and start
107.92,3.04,coding
108.72,4.399,otherwise it can pay off to start doing
110.96,4.64,some research
113.119,4.401,see what websites are popular what are
115.6,4.799,users currently used to
117.52,4.0,what's the layout like the more familiar
120.399,4.161,your interface is
121.52,3.68,the more comfortable the user feels fun
124.56,2.879,fact
125.2,3.839,when a user interacts with an interface
127.439,4.8,that does not feel natural
129.039,5.601,the size of their pupils change
132.239,3.441,during your research you may notice that
134.64,4.319,for instance
135.68,5.84,bank sites all look alike it might be
138.959,4.64,worth looking into your industry
141.52,3.84,how does the leading brand have their
143.599,3.761,web designed
145.36,3.28,when you're done inserting content and
147.36,4.64,start adding colors
148.64,5.2,effects font families and font weights
152.0,3.36,it'll be important to do some research
153.84,3.92,on color blindness
155.36,3.68,and how users may perceive colors
157.76,3.36,differently
159.04,3.199,visual impairment is common and there
161.12,3.44,are ways to design
162.239,3.121,for this instance consider what colors
164.56,4.399,you use
165.36,5.599,when establishing important interactions
168.959,4.0,when you've got your site prepared
170.959,2.56,invite some participants to test your
172.959,3.92,product
173.519,6.481,or service survey them and see how you
176.879,5.121,can improve your design
180.0,3.519,when we design we typically have the
182.0,3.519,user's interest in mind
183.519,3.841,but it's important to know that the
185.519,4.401,user's interest is a part of the
187.36,2.56,development
196.84,3.0,itself
