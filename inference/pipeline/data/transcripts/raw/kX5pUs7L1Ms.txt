second,duration,transcript
0.08,4.32,physics and cs
2.159,4.001,uh with as much work and on quantum
4.4,3.84,complexity theory as from the physics
6.16,3.84,side and which has lots of work on
8.24,4.0,quantum hamiltonian complexity error
10.0,4.48,correction
12.24,4.64,and then uh it's pleasure to also have
14.48,2.4,adam
19.199,4.961,adam recently won the philip meyer prize
22.08,3.76,in theoretical physics for his work on
24.16,4.32,which is quite relevant on on the
25.84,5.439,dynamics of quantum many body systems
28.48,5.36,especially using uh techniques using uh
31.279,4.481,involving random quantum circuits
33.84,2.719,so um
35.76,3.28,so
36.559,6.281,uh to to kick off the panel let me just
39.04,6.8,let me just start by putting out a
42.84,6.76,somewhat provocative vision along the
45.84,6.399,you know uh i think that maybe shivaji
49.6,4.08,had been hinting at but this is this is
52.239,2.96,at least the way a computer scientist
53.68,6.24,would look at it so let me let me just
55.199,7.441,try to see how i view it so uh so
59.92,5.04,you know you you might say well
62.64,4.32,how would quantum computers be be useful
64.96,3.839,well you know we have we have several
66.96,3.68,ways we could think of it one is well we
68.799,3.521,are going to solve optimization problems
70.64,3.36,or things like factoring you know
72.32,3.04,well-defined computational problems of
74.0,3.68,that kind
75.36,4.56,the the other way we could say is well
77.68,4.479,you know let's let's go back to the fact
79.92,4.8,that quantum quantum computers would
82.159,4.241,allow you to simulate quantum mechanics
84.72,4.0,efficiently and that's surely a very
86.4,3.679,important thing to do
88.72,3.68,so
90.079,3.921,and and what else could there be well
92.4,3.12,well there's a there's a third way to
94.0,3.759,look at it which is
95.52,4.0,if you look at classical computers one
97.759,4.881,of the things that they provide us with
99.52,4.08,is is an excellent interface to to the
102.64,3.839,world
103.6,5.839,um you know and and then in computer
106.479,5.521,science terms we talk about the human
109.439,3.601,hci human computer interface
112.0,3.119,and so
113.04,4.96,well if we think about it in the in the
115.119,4.32,context of of the quantum world then
118.0,3.52,then this takes on a completely
119.439,4.96,different different view in the sense
121.52,5.279,that hilbert space is very large
124.399,5.2,and the way we could think about it is
126.799,5.681,that that our experience of this of
129.599,3.841,hilbert space is mediated through
132.48,2.8,through
133.44,3.04,uh you know whichever parts of albert
135.28,3.12,space are
136.48,4.399,you know are accessible through the fact
138.4,4.88,that they are amplified to the classical
140.879,5.281,world through measurements
143.28,4.8,and so could it be that um that once we
146.16,2.799,have quantum computers
148.08,3.519,that
148.959,4.721,that this allows us to prove through
151.599,3.681,a parts of hilbert space that we you
153.68,4.559,know we wouldn't have been able to probe
155.28,5.12,otherwise you know so that so that it it
158.239,5.441,you know that our classical experience
160.4,5.199,which which we could think of as as
163.68,4.24,you know as an experience of the parts
165.599,4.961,of hilbert space that we can normally
167.92,5.28,we normally have access to you know
170.56,5.44,could we actually enhance that by
173.2,5.6,by by mediating it through through a
176.0,4.56,quantum computer so i i know this sounds
178.8,4.64,sounds somewhat uh
180.56,4.88,you know part you know but um
183.44,3.76,but you know this is one way you could
185.44,3.519,think about this interactive quantum
187.2,3.44,dynamics and say
188.959,3.761,what can we achieve through through this
190.64,4.72,method so anyway i'll turn it over to
192.72,6.08,the panelists to take a few minutes to
195.36,5.04,get their thoughts about about um
198.8,3.6,you know they may have about shivaji's
200.4,4.16,talk about and also about anything else
202.4,4.399,they'd like to like to bring up
204.56,2.239,so
210.84,4.6,um almost one comment about what you
213.28,3.92,just said of course um
215.44,3.519,you know what the talk that we heard
217.2,4.08,today which was very nice from shivaji
218.959,4.881,is not quite like that because often we
221.28,4.72,have classical predictions and
223.84,4.479,you know we come with theories and so on
226.0,3.84,so we're not entirely open to
228.319,3.761,you know we we want to have a problem
229.84,4.08,where where the experiment is actually
232.08,3.76,telling us hey you know
233.92,4.08,this is going on and now
235.84,3.599,let's try to explain it better or right
238.0,3.2,it has to be come first from the
239.439,3.281,experiment and then
241.2,5.44,maybe the theorists will have some
242.72,3.92,classical description of it right
247.28,4.08,that would be more interesting
250.08,4.32,um
251.36,4.239,so so you're saying you're saying
254.4,2.32,um
255.599,4.721,um
256.72,6.0,it it it could be that that um that
260.32,4.24,that um that the phenomenon would
262.72,3.84,actually first come up in experiment
264.56,3.76,before we actually understand it yeah
266.56,4.24,that would be the more interesting thing
268.32,4.0,in in because now i think i mean i i you
270.8,3.28,know i don't want to do i want to do
272.32,3.84,justice to you know the talk that we
274.08,3.36,just heard i found it interesting but
276.16,3.12,it's something where you say well we
277.44,3.44,expect maybe something like this and now
279.28,4.479,we're testing this
280.88,4.08,but it's no it's not it's a confirmation
283.759,3.521,but of course things get really
284.96,3.519,interesting when the experiment shows up
287.28,3.919,things that we
288.479,4.641,regularities or patterns that we do not
291.199,4.081,quite understand
293.12,3.68,it can kind of work
295.28,4.56,you know work in conjunction in the
296.8,4.88,sense that you you you sort of uh say
299.84,4.079,well if you look in this direction we
301.68,3.6,may find something but then you look you
303.919,3.12,look for it you find it but then you
305.28,3.359,find something else as well
307.039,3.121,so in other words
308.639,5.041,where do you look where do you start by
310.16,6.72,looking and uh and and so in in you know
313.68,5.68,you could sort of say well how um
316.88,3.84,you know if if we wanted to if we wanted
319.36,3.52,to use
320.72,3.759,well first to what extent is it possible
322.88,3.92,but then if you wanted to use quantum
324.479,3.921,computers to mediate the search
326.8,3.52,for for uh
328.4,3.519,for for sort of
330.32,3.36,you know isn't it possible that one
331.919,2.881,could have completely new physical
333.68,3.359,phenomena
334.8,3.92,that were not accessible to us because
337.039,3.521,because the normal mechanisms for
338.72,3.039,observation would not have revealed them
340.56,3.44,to us
341.759,4.16,those phenomena to us but they're now
344.0,4.16,access they might be accessible just
345.919,5.961,because we have we have an intermediary
348.16,3.72,which is a quantum computer
353.199,3.521,yeah i think that's interesting but
354.72,4.88,maybe some of the other panelists have
356.72,2.88,thoughts on this yeah
361.919,5.801,i i think we are not there yet but i
364.72,3.0,think
372.639,3.201,which is that
373.919,3.681,you know it should be
375.84,3.52,you know it's a new physical system and
377.6,3.28,it should do things you know the real
379.36,3.119,payoff is going to be to run it in
380.88,3.2,experimental mode
382.479,4.56,in which you
384.08,4.64,search and hopefully you need some
387.039,3.201,cost function which tells you what's
388.72,2.479,interesting and then you then you go
390.24,1.76,looking
391.199,2.401,so
392.0,3.28,this talk was more to say you know the
393.6,4.08,way to look at it is perhaps to say
395.28,4.56,supposing we had had such devices
397.68,4.32,20 years ago maybe we would have found
399.84,3.68,time crystals by searching for them
402.0,3.28,on these devices whereas we couldn't
403.52,3.519,have found them on you know other
405.28,4.08,devices so i
407.039,4.081,mean i absolutely agree with you know
409.36,3.44,what she said coming back to what you
411.12,3.44,said i think
412.8,2.64,as a formal matter
414.56,2.639,um
415.44,2.8,right we're going to be looking at a
417.199,2.56,certain
418.24,3.12,in the space of
419.759,2.88,heaven which are made up of this
421.36,3.279,territory of
422.639,3.601,you know unitaries and measurements
424.639,3.12,now
426.24,3.28,the answer to your question is somehow
427.759,2.88,buried in there which is to say that if
429.52,2.799,you were
430.639,4.161,simulating
432.319,4.32,you know some aspect of the world
434.8,2.72,which you normally perceive in a certain
436.639,2.721,way
437.52,4.399,you know would you perceive it sort of
439.36,2.559,differently
442.0,4.96,if you could if you could go this way so
444.88,3.68,i think you maybe have to simulate the
446.96,3.92,world
448.56,4.16,closer to
450.88,3.68,the one we live in as opposed to you
452.72,3.759,know
454.56,5.359,but in principle
456.479,3.44,i think they're the same
462.479,5.201,ultimately any
465.199,3.761,experiment in the observation you know
467.68,2.16,it's start somewhere in the end
468.96,2.639,somewhere
469.84,2.52,you do some number of things along the
471.599,2.081,way
472.36,3.239,[Music]
473.68,6.4,so so what you're looking for
475.599,4.481,fits in this larger class of evolutions
480.639,2.321,somewhere
483.84,2.96,um
485.12,2.56,should i pick up on
486.8,2.88,something
487.68,5.359,shivaji said at the very beginning
489.68,3.359,maybe i can ask you
505.12,5.28,on the connection or something so you um
507.36,4.239,made a comment at the beginning about
510.4,3.04,um
511.599,4.88,you made a contrast with
513.44,5.279,between quantum computation and the kind
516.479,5.04,of things we think about in stat mech
518.719,4.641,in terms of kind of a system which is
521.519,3.521,sort of statistically homogeneous
523.36,4.88,everywhere versus
525.04,3.2,a very highly structured
528.88,4.16,computation
530.399,2.641,and um
533.279,3.841,so i wanted to ask sort of how much if
535.6,3.84,we want to make a bridge between those
537.12,4.24,things how much is that a worry
539.44,3.92,and
541.36,4.96,or
543.36,4.96,or might be possible to put
546.32,4.88,things which are more like real quantum
548.32,4.24,computations in a statistical mechanics
551.2,2.319,language
552.56,3.44,so
553.519,4.961,for example as a question for quantum
556.0,5.839,information people
558.48,7.039,might it make sense to have
561.839,6.0,sort of random ensembles of algorithms
565.519,3.76,which look a bit like more like a
567.839,2.401,statement problem you know in the sense
569.279,3.601,that we have
570.24,4.32,in many body physics random hamiltonians
572.88,4.24,random matrix theory and we can have
574.56,4.0,random circuits but presumably that's
577.12,2.8,not anything like what you'd think of as
578.56,3.04,a computation
579.92,4.88,but
581.6,5.44,is it imaginable that you could have
584.8,2.24,um
587.2,4.8,random ensembles of
590.08,4.24,algorithms so you could start to ask in
592.0,4.24,a statistical mechanics language about
594.32,3.36,generic properties of
596.24,2.88,quantum computations and things like
597.68,3.44,that or are you always going to have
599.12,3.92,this problem that shivaji mentioned but
601.12,4.48,a real computation of interest is always
603.04,4.799,something specific and structured and
605.6,3.6,there's a disjunction with
607.839,3.841,the kind of things we think about in
609.2,2.48,stomach
614.16,3.6,there's a bit of a vague question but i
615.519,3.041,just wonder how how close do you think
617.76,2.88,is that
618.56,3.68,is that for is that for me or shivaji
620.64,5.12,i'm i'm not
622.24,3.52,um it's for anyone here
629.519,4.721,well i think i can tell from the
630.959,3.281,experience that uh
634.72,5.2,there is a
637.279,5.841,there is a impact and the community of
639.92,4.72,interest for a given algorithm we do
643.12,4.48,and then there is a computational
644.64,5.199,complexity of that algorithm so one time
647.6,4.4,which we did it successfully
649.839,4.321,the community of interest became very
652.0,4.8,very narrow we managed to make big
654.16,5.28,strings with high fidelity better than
656.8,4.96,classical computer so we outperform a
659.44,4.8,classical computer but the community of
661.76,4.16,interest become very narrow so i imagine
664.24,2.64,that the next
665.92,2.88,case
666.88,4.0,we might solve a problem let's say
668.8,4.32,related to out-of-time order correlation
670.88,4.16,or something that would have a slightly
673.12,4.56,bigger community of interest or bigger
675.04,4.96,bigger class of group of algorithm so i
677.68,4.8,think you guys are maybe uh talking a
680.0,4.32,little more general that you know cost
682.48,3.52,functions and algorithm in general i
684.32,3.519,think uh these are
686.0,4.32,a little further down in the down the
687.839,4.721,line in the future but i think uh
690.32,4.639,various specific cases like you know
692.56,3.839,time crystals or um
694.959,3.44,highly in
696.399,5.201,the group of algorithms or the class of
698.399,4.641,algorithms uh we're gonna gonna um very
701.6,2.96,slowly grow
703.04,4.0,and the community of interest is going
704.56,4.64,to people who care about those cases are
707.04,3.919,going to very slowly grow
709.2,4.0,is not going to be very different than
710.959,2.241,our
713.44,3.519,quantum supremacy experiment which was
715.6,3.76,not
716.959,4.081,you know which was highly contrived to
719.36,3.44,to beat the classical computer
721.04,3.76,essentially
722.8,4.159,so i i think it would be
724.8,4.4,very similar to that the next the next
726.959,5.041,milestone
729.2,5.04,okay maybe as a as a common to adam i
732.0,4.72,think i i mean i think it doesn't right
734.24,4.08,we like to you design optimal algorithms
736.72,3.2,right so it doesn't fit very nicely with
738.32,3.199,the statistical picture
739.92,3.68,you know only when you're a very little
741.519,5.041,child you do random things but you
743.6,4.88,quickly learn the optimal strategies and
746.56,3.36,uh but in that sense i think maybe
748.48,3.919,machine learning and quality machine
749.92,5.2,learning you have some of that where you
752.399,5.041,can do some statistics
755.12,4.48,right but not in the sort of critical
757.44,3.04,design of algorithms at least i don't
759.6,2.88,see it
760.48,5.2,maybe i can ask a question to shivaji
762.48,5.359,about his talk or about the field a bit
765.68,5.12,um and this is on the effect of noise
767.839,4.721,and also related to experiment so
770.8,3.52,well you made the point you wanted the
772.56,5.44,things were done to distinguish the
774.32,4.959,effect of noise and thermalization
778.0,4.0,um
779.279,5.761,without you know presence of noise but a
782.0,5.12,noise can also be you know uh positive
785.04,4.08,right it is the noise in these devices
787.12,3.36,is not the polarizing noises necessarily
789.12,3.76,it's actually if you
790.48,4.56,leave the device alone uh most cubits
792.88,3.92,just you know go to their ground state
795.04,4.4,and with their some you know
796.8,4.479,there's some fluctuations not entirely
799.44,3.199,true but not necessarily very high
801.279,2.161,entropy states
802.639,2.481,so
803.44,4.0,you could also have
805.12,4.56,you know why not include the noise in
807.44,5.28,the description of these phases or
809.68,5.839,are there reasons so how does the field
812.72,4.559,look at noise or lint blood equations so
815.519,6.081,they say
817.279,6.24,and and phases in those systems
821.6,4.239,right
823.519,2.32,actually
826.56,5.2,it goes on the call may be able to speak
828.639,4.64,more precisely to this but you know uh
831.76,2.96,in terms of different kinds of noise
833.279,3.12,because uh
834.72,3.2,she and
836.399,3.12,their equality
837.92,4.24,stanford
839.519,4.401,did a lot of the development
842.16,4.0,broadly speaking
843.92,2.24,um
847.04,4.08,experience has been that
848.959,3.68,if you add some
851.12,5.36,fairly general
852.639,5.2,then the time crystals to be well
856.48,3.599,defined
857.839,2.24,is
860.16,3.119,and so
862.079,2.88,now
863.279,3.041,i'm hedging because you raised the
864.959,4.161,question of you know could there be some
866.32,4.4,very specific kind of noise which
869.12,3.04,exists in these devices which could
870.72,3.52,still leave you i
872.16,3.76,i know maybe
874.24,4.08,i know they thought a bit about it and
875.92,4.0,indeed when we began the experiment part
878.32,4.16,of the hope was
879.92,5.52,that the experiment itself
882.48,5.76,maybe tell us that the error model that
885.44,5.199,one really should use for these devices
888.24,4.48,is more specific than
890.639,4.161,the one that was thought of initially in
892.72,4.799,the quantum supremacy experiment but
894.8,4.24,maybe vitica can jump in and speak to
897.519,2.961,what we learned
899.04,2.64,at the end of the day that would be
900.48,2.719,great
901.68,2.64,oh yeah so i can
903.199,3.44,maybe say
904.32,4.16,two things one is um
906.639,3.76,in indeed you know in the mbl problem
908.48,3.84,where the problem itself has structure
910.399,4.24,if your noise also has structure so for
912.32,4.4,instance in in mbl we have these
914.639,4.161,conserved operators which mostly look
916.72,5.359,like they're aligned in the z basis so
918.8,4.88,if you only had the phasing noise um
922.079,3.281,which coupled to that z channel that's
923.68,4.48,that's in a sense less dangerous than
925.36,4.32,than spin flip noise so there are there
928.16,3.76,are different kind of
929.68,4.0,differences in that regard but you know
931.92,3.52,in this particular platform there was no
933.68,4.399,reason to expect that
935.44,4.0,one type of noise is is dominant over
938.079,3.68,another
939.44,4.48,um so so then you know the depolarizing
941.759,4.08,model works pretty well as an
943.92,2.8,approximation but then let me give a
945.839,2.601,second
946.72,3.6,answer to that which is um
948.44,3.48,[Music]
950.32,3.04,which shivaji alluded to which is you
951.92,2.96,know can we
953.36,2.719,which is the benchmarking business right
954.88,3.68,so can we
956.079,4.961,use noise maybe more as a as a feature
958.56,4.48,rather than a bug right so can we
961.04,3.84,can we maybe if we wanted to probe the
963.04,4.64,properties of these l bits for instance
964.88,3.519,can we can we it is certainly the case
967.68,2.959,that
968.399,3.921,you know the effect of noise is is
970.639,3.44,different depending on what the
972.32,3.199,intrinsic dynamics and your problem are
974.079,3.921,to give you an example you know if you
975.519,4.0,have some noise in some one cubit if
978.0,3.759,you're in the localized phase the effect
979.519,4.24,of the noise acts in time but doesn't
981.759,3.921,really spread out in space
983.759,4.32,on the thermalizing side the effect of
985.68,4.399,noise you know spreads over space very
988.079,4.0,quickly um and that that is what the
990.079,2.88,supremacy experiment was was plugging
992.079,3.921,into
992.959,4.56,so so i think it's a it's a broader uh
996.0,3.12,question to see you know if you have
997.519,3.68,different types of noise could we use
999.12,3.92,that to characterize the
1001.199,3.681,dynamics based on how they couple to the
1003.04,4.08,noise but but at least just for the time
1004.88,4.639,crystal experiment there was nothing
1007.12,4.32,extremely special there
1009.519,3.68,but is there was there a limit because
1011.44,3.36,the time crystal experiment you know
1013.199,3.841,with a certain number of rounds and what
1014.8,4.64,if you would gone uh ten times longer
1017.04,5.039,would you you know would i assume you
1019.44,5.999,believe it be the same it would uh
1022.079,5.041,not be um over dominated by noise is
1025.439,3.921,that right or is this
1027.12,4.24,yeah yeah so okay so so this is um
1029.36,5.12,shivaji didn't delve into this in too
1031.36,4.8,much detail but you know one of the
1034.48,3.68,indeed i mean you you know instead of
1036.16,3.84,decaying exponentially in the space time
1038.16,4.159,volume in the time crystal experiment
1040.0,4.0,you're mostly decaying exponentially in
1042.319,3.681,time because the the effect of the noise
1044.0,3.76,is not is not spreading out too much so
1046.0,4.4,if you wait long enough in a realistic
1047.76,4.4,experiment the signal will go to zero so
1050.4,4.399,some of the things that we did was to
1052.16,4.32,employ kind of time reversal protocols
1054.799,4.081,to try to distinguish between this
1056.48,3.36,intrinsic thermalization and external
1058.88,2.64,noise
1059.84,3.44,so you know so for instance what we did
1061.52,4.159,is we we measured the same
1063.28,4.72,autocorrelators but time evolved with u
1065.679,4.081,dagger u which of course unitarily would
1068.0,3.2,be would be just one
1069.76,4.0,um but
1071.2,3.68,but then what it what it picks up is is
1073.76,2.48,more the
1074.88,3.52,if you get a decay for that
1076.24,3.84,autocorrelator that's coming
1078.4,2.88,dominantly from the noise because if it
1080.08,2.24,is perfectly unitary there would be
1081.28,3.2,nothing
1082.32,4.56,and in in the limit of being deep in the
1084.48,4.96,mbl phase if you kind of
1086.88,5.679,divide out the actual dynamics with this
1089.44,5.599,kind of normalization factor um you you
1092.559,4.48,reproduce what you should get to to very
1095.039,4.88,good accuracy so
1097.039,4.0,so what that means is that um
1099.919,2.64,you know at some point you're going to
1101.039,3.921,hit the noise floor in the experiment
1102.559,4.721,you know so so this this division works
1104.96,4.16,well on on a computer but there you'll
1107.28,2.72,get numerical precision and a lab you'll
1109.12,3.52,hit
1110.0,3.52,measurement precision but but but modulo
1112.64,2.32,those
1113.52,4.0,things yes we could have gone a factor
1114.96,6.28,of two longer in time and and still been
1117.52,3.72,able to see something
1123.039,5.681,it's just a signal to noise ratio you
1125.919,5.12,have to average for a long time
1128.72,5.319,and then at some point we get tired of
1131.039,3.0,averaging
1136.32,3.2,maybe i can ask a question in the
1137.6,3.439,bedroom so
1139.52,4.24,in terms of
1141.039,5.041,the platform i mean
1143.76,3.68,when do you see it impossible to
1146.08,3.839,actually
1147.44,2.479,feedback
1156.799,3.921,it's hard to make promise publicly so
1158.64,5.6,maybe i should definitely not not next
1160.72,6.16,about that
1164.24,4.64,uh we are focusing for pat on passive
1166.88,5.84,error correction currently
1168.88,5.84,um for for active correction you have to
1172.72,4.16,uh bring the time of the readout of the
1174.72,4.72,qubits much closer to the time of the
1176.88,4.24,gate and particularly on the
1179.44,3.84,experiment that you mentioned on your
1181.12,4.16,last minute of talk on measurement
1183.28,4.08,induced the current
1185.28,4.72,challenge for us is that the gates are
1187.36,6.4,about 30 nanoseconds but the time to
1190.0,7.2,measure the state reliably is close to
1193.76,6.08,800 nanoseconds so and the feedback and
1197.2,5.2,the measurement induced transition both
1199.84,4.56,needs a much shorter readout time
1202.4,3.44,and that's a very hard
1204.4,2.96,engineering challenge which we are
1205.84,3.76,working on so
1207.36,3.36,uh i think first you would hear from us
1209.6,3.199,that we have
1210.72,3.52,managed to do shorter readout and then
1212.799,3.76,then these feedbacks would follow
1214.24,5.04,problems
1216.559,5.12,so so in in terms of actually being able
1219.28,3.84,to do an interactive
1221.679,3.761,experiment
1223.12,5.679,that that you would say would
1225.44,6.96,is is a little ways off
1228.799,5.441,yeah i i yeah i think so it's uh
1232.4,3.519,certain engineering challenges are
1234.24,3.439,really
1235.919,5.12,rooted in deep physics that we don't
1237.679,3.36,have good understanding from
1243.36,4.559,um sorry but um
1245.6,4.88,just just pursuing that a little bit
1247.919,4.081,about the interactive aspect so survivor
1250.48,4.079,you you've worked on
1252.0,4.799,some of the complexity theoretic aspects
1254.559,4.161,of interactive
1256.799,3.76,you know experiments so
1258.72,4.0,can you say a little bit about that so
1260.559,3.36,it's in in terms of
1262.72,2.24,well
1263.919,3.201,yeah i mean
1264.96,4.4,you know there are various reasons why
1267.12,4.72,one does these interactive
1269.36,2.48,protocols
1272.72,4.16,well yeah i don't know whether i'm able
1274.48,4.72,to comply in the sense that i haven't
1276.88,5.12,thought about uh interactive proof
1279.2,4.479,systems for example in the in a while i
1282.0,4.159,more think about error correction these
1283.679,4.561,days and that's uh there's a lot of
1286.159,4.88,you there you also need interaction but
1288.24,3.84,uh well not maybe at the first first
1291.039,2.961,rounds
1292.08,4.32,you hope to get all the information
1294.0,5.12,about errors and then leisurely process
1296.4,2.72,this um
1300.159,4.4,yeah i don't know what to say
1303.12,3.36,i'm actually surprising that you
1304.559,4.321,surprised that you do you stress this
1306.48,4.0,interaction because a very old-fashioned
1308.88,3.2,point of view and economy information
1310.48,2.559,was like well if you do a measurement in
1312.08,2.56,the middle
1313.039,3.681,you know you can just replace it by
1314.64,2.88,something quantum and then you know you
1316.72,2.48,then
1317.52,3.36,but of course the point is you're using
1319.2,3.839,you're leveraging the power of classical
1320.88,3.279,computers in this interaction yeah and
1323.039,2.88,that's uh
1324.159,2.88,that's really the thing that makes it
1325.919,3.361,different
1327.039,4.0,well you know i i think that that's
1329.28,3.279,correct um you know
1331.039,3.361,of course that goes back to the very
1332.559,3.6,early days you know when when the
1334.4,3.2,question came up whether
1336.159,3.361,immediate measurements increase the
1337.6,4.0,power of quantum computing
1339.52,4.0,but but now there are there are also
1341.6,3.84,these other issues right having to do
1343.52,5.039,with well i mean you worked on that as
1345.44,5.119,well but uh in terms of uh you know how
1348.559,3.681,do you how do you deal with untrusted
1350.559,2.881,important devices but through
1352.24,2.4,interaction
1353.44,3.119,and how do you
1354.64,4.159,how do you use it to reach into hilbert
1356.559,4.48,space in ways that you would not be able
1358.799,2.24,to do
1362.07,3.16,[Music]
1365.52,3.639,there's a whole new
1379.76,3.52,well i guess you guys have touched on a
1381.36,3.439,lot of this but um
1383.28,3.279,i mean along what barbara was saying
1384.799,3.681,about interaction it does seem like
1386.559,2.801,fault tolerance is a very important case
1388.48,3.439,here
1389.36,5.6,and it's a situation where
1391.919,3.041,where errors don't belong
1396.159,2.161,so
1398.799,5.041,i mean people have talked about it in
1400.159,3.681,sort of vague terms in terms of
1403.919,2.481,but
1405.2,2.56,you know
1406.4,3.519,i guess one interesting thing is that if
1407.76,4.159,you have a generic quantum circuit
1409.919,3.681,like one error in the middle will will
1411.919,3.681,completely randomize the final answer
1413.6,3.28,and then a fault tolerance circuit looks
1415.6,4.16,very different one error in the middle
1416.88,3.84,will have no effect on the final answer
1419.76,2.399,um
1420.72,2.88,and
1422.159,3.041,one
1423.6,3.28,i guess
1425.2,4.079,one related
1426.88,4.24,so yes what is the question one
1429.279,3.52,one question i have
1431.12,3.28,is um
1432.799,3.601,we do
1434.4,5.44,random quantum circuits
1436.4,4.8,as a toy model for a non-error corrected
1439.84,2.56,quantum circuits
1441.2,2.4,um
1442.4,2.56,and
1443.6,2.4,and is there any way to sharpen that
1444.96,2.959,intuition like maybe a
1446.0,3.039,non-error-corrected quantum circuit
1447.919,2.801,where we're just sort of not really
1449.039,3.76,trying to do things
1450.72,3.839,uh maybe there's some way to compress it
1452.799,3.12,so that it really looks even more like a
1454.559,2.561,random quantum circuit you know like
1455.919,2.481,maybe we're not being as efficient with
1457.12,3.039,our degrees of freedom but there's a way
1458.4,2.8,to to compress it so it looks nearly
1460.159,2.161,random
1461.2,2.16,um
1462.32,2.88,i don't know exactly what the right
1463.36,3.679,questions are there but it seems like
1465.2,3.76,there's a vague intuition there that
1467.039,5.041,like we study circuits because they're a
1468.96,4.959,proxy for generic quantum dynamics i
1472.08,4.24,wonder if there's a way to sharpen that
1473.919,2.401,in any way
1477.12,3.36,could you say again what it was you
1478.32,4.64,wanted to compress you you want to start
1480.48,3.92,with a generic random circuit and or you
1482.96,4.0,or you want generic circuit let's say
1484.4,4.56,let's say i have a circuit to you know
1486.96,3.36,factor short algorithm you do shores
1488.96,3.28,algorithm or simulate the transverse
1490.32,3.04,field i see model on a quantum computer
1492.24,2.48,but
1493.36,2.799,there are various tricks that people
1494.72,2.24,have to say
1496.159,2.481,well
1496.96,3.76,you know sometimes we can save a few
1498.64,3.919,qubits here maybe we can model the
1500.72,3.6,circuit as a tensor network and we find
1502.559,4.161,that it's not quite as entangled across
1504.32,4.4,this cut so we could we could compress
1506.72,3.28,this side to fewer cubics
1508.72,3.04,um
1510.0,3.12,there are various papers about
1511.76,2.88,you know simulating large quantum
1513.12,3.76,circuits on smaller quantum computers
1514.64,3.919,and and they hit limits when you could
1516.88,2.64,say it's maybe it becomes hard to
1518.559,2.48,compress because the amount of
1519.52,4.88,entanglement across
1521.039,4.401,uh subsystems becomes nearly maximal so
1524.4,2.56,um
1525.44,3.2,so i'm not quite sure what the right and
1526.96,3.839,now what the right
1528.64,4.24,thing is there i will say
1530.799,4.161,you know for classical
1532.88,5.12,data translation there's a sort of
1534.96,4.8,heuristic idea that sort of generically
1538.0,4.64,if i'm just typing english that's not
1539.76,4.72,full entropy but if i run it through a
1542.64,4.399,data compression algorithm i get
1544.48,4.72,something that's nearly full entropy
1547.039,4.081,and you know maybe that's a start a good
1549.2,2.8,starting point if i'm going to
1551.12,4.32,um
1552.0,4.4,try to use to to encrypt it in a graphic
1555.44,2.64,way
1556.4,2.399,this is all this is all very heuristic
1558.08,2.079,but
1558.799,4.161,um
1560.159,4.801,there's a sense that sort of generic
1562.96,3.28,generic data is not
1564.96,2.88,you know has some entropy but it's not
1566.24,3.52,full entropy but compressing it makes it
1567.84,3.439,nearly full entropy so
1569.76,2.96,you know this is extremely hand-wavy
1571.279,3.441,what i'm saying but
1572.72,5.04,uh i wonder if there's any utility just
1574.72,3.04,trying to formalize any of it
1578.64,3.919,well it's almost like a sort of arcgish
1580.799,3.521,idea that you want to coarse grain and
1582.559,3.921,sort of flow off to a fixed point so you
1584.32,3.68,want a certain circuit go off fully
1586.48,2.799,random
1588.0,2.96,yeah
1589.279,3.28,don't we know that for a generic circuit
1590.96,4.16,you can't compress it very much that it
1592.559,4.321,still has a generically it has a circuit
1595.12,3.679,complexity which is proportional to its
1596.88,4.24,depth just with them
1598.799,4.24,with right which is more than one well
1601.12,4.72,this you know this video call like you
1603.039,4.401,know a generic um
1605.84,3.199,communication message i cannot compress
1607.44,3.839,but yet this video call is compressed
1609.039,3.921,because our you know our faces are not
1611.279,2.88,generic images so
1612.96,2.56,um
1614.159,3.441,that's that's the intuition of you know
1615.52,3.2,maybe many quantum circuits can be
1617.6,3.04,compressed
1618.72,3.199,um
1620.64,4.08,another way of saying that is you know a
1621.919,4.801,lot of these random circuits
1624.72,2.8,they thermalize to infinite temperature
1626.72,2.16,but
1627.52,4.48,you know things are are not always at
1628.88,4.56,infinite temperature um and so there's
1632.0,2.88,that's another way in which the theory
1633.44,3.44,could be could be developed a little bit
1634.88,4.32,more of uh i mean i think there you know
1636.88,4.399,there are there are random circuits that
1639.2,3.04,have conserved quantity so
1641.279,3.28,yeah i don't know if that's the right
1642.24,3.12,direction
1644.559,3.521,sorry
1645.36,4.88,just very quickly um
1648.08,4.319,you you mentioned sort of in one breath
1650.24,3.84,the simulating the isaac model or
1652.399,4.16,something like that and a quantum
1654.08,4.56,algorithm to do a useful task
1656.559,3.521,a computational task but maybe the
1658.64,3.6,question that many of us
1660.08,4.319,statistical physicists would have is how
1662.24,4.319,should we heuristically think of what
1664.399,5.041,those circuits which are doing something
1666.559,4.72,computationally useful look like
1669.44,4.08,and how do they look different to
1671.279,3.601,chaotic evolution of a many-body system
1673.52,2.72,and
1674.88,2.32,that's i don't have any intuition for
1676.24,2.799,that that was sort of what i was trying
1677.2,3.28,to get to
1679.039,3.52,before
1680.48,3.6,yeah i mean it's very complicated enough
1682.559,3.281,others have insight into this but you
1684.08,4.079,know just think about an algorithm that
1685.84,4.719,multiplies two numbers
1688.159,4.081,or does modular exponentiation
1690.559,3.441,in a lot of these if you have one bit
1692.24,4.24,that gets flipped it's going to affect a
1694.0,4.32,lot of other bits and if it didn't then
1696.48,4.079,you could probably paralyze it you know
1698.32,3.76,if you have little blocks and each bit
1700.559,2.401,in there doesn't affect you any other
1702.08,3.36,bits
1702.96,4.719,then that means that there's scope to to
1705.44,3.28,parallelize it um
1707.679,2.0,and that's
1708.72,3.6,so
1709.679,4.561,that's that's sort of like why
1712.32,3.44,i suggest that uh you know
1714.24,4.159,if you've taken advantage of all the
1715.76,3.44,efficiencies you can then then things
1718.399,2.64,you know
1719.2,4.64,that it may start to look look like a
1721.039,4.64,random circuit even though
1723.84,3.199,yeah that's the vague intuition behind
1725.679,2.88,that
1727.039,4.081,yeah
1728.559,5.12,can i can i comment on this or can i
1731.12,3.6,maybe pick up on this
1733.679,2.801,please yeah
1734.72,5.28,yeah so
1736.48,5.6,maybe an answer and a ques to
1740.0,4.159,an attempted answer to adam's question
1742.08,4.719,about a random
1744.159,4.481,ensemble of algorithms and basically
1746.799,4.401,sending this question to the computer
1748.64,5.68,scientists here so if i i take for
1751.2,6.64,example a piece of quantum material
1754.32,5.76,at some reasonable lowish temperature or
1757.84,3.439,energy density and i take it out of
1760.08,4.88,equilibrium
1761.279,5.12,and i let it evolve in time and it's
1764.96,3.52,going to
1766.399,3.681,generate very non-local entanglement
1768.48,3.36,very non-local correlations it's
1770.08,4.319,performing some kind of quantum
1771.84,6.0,computation in the end we can read off
1774.399,4.801,an answer in a set of readout qubits and
1777.84,3.199,the answer will
1779.2,6.16,generically be something like what is
1781.039,6.481,the uh diffusion coefficient of this uh
1785.36,3.919,quantum material right we'll get this
1787.52,3.759,answer and we'll get actually the same
1789.279,4.481,answer no matter what is the disorder
1791.279,5.681,realization in this material as long as
1793.76,5.919,the average disorder is is thinking
1796.96,4.079,so the question is in what sense can
1799.679,3.681,this be
1801.039,4.081,thought of as if we think of this
1803.36,5.12,material as a circuit
1805.12,5.439,uh as as a quantum algorithm as an
1808.48,4.319,ensemble of quantum algorithms that
1810.559,4.881,proves the same answer and we can
1812.799,5.12,somehow try to analyze it in computer
1815.44,4.8,science ways and see if it
1817.919,5.041,has a quantum it gives a quantum
1820.24,5.36,advantage for example is is this an
1822.96,4.719,example of um in symbol of algorithms
1825.6,6.0,that we can actually and have actually
1827.679,6.921,looked at in in statistical mechanics
1831.6,3.0,analysis
1839.279,2.561,well i i don't want to do real things
1840.64,2.399,too much with the compression thing but
1841.84,3.36,one thing you could do in this kind of
1843.039,4.721,low temperature setting is if you could
1845.2,4.56,say well suppose the system has a
1847.76,4.159,some entropy density so that means that
1849.76,4.72,you can take little blocks and compress
1851.919,3.441,them and maybe you can do the then
1854.48,2.16,you can
1855.36,2.559,that could be on your that could the
1856.64,3.44,quantum computer could do that fairly
1857.919,3.6,cheaply perhaps and then the dynamics
1860.08,2.8,could be done
1861.519,3.601,um
1862.88,4.159,you know
1865.12,5.36,that then you could do the dynamics on
1867.039,5.76,this on this compressed space um
1870.48,4.319,and and then even though your the
1872.799,3.76,underlying system is low temperature
1874.799,3.76,that would be gonna be closer to
1876.559,4.161,something where where each qubit looks
1878.559,3.84,closer to maximally mixed now
1880.72,3.839,there's still many many steps from there
1882.399,4.241,to like does it fully look like a random
1884.559,2.881,quantum circuit but that would at least
1886.64,2.159,be
1887.44,2.56,you know getting closer to something
1888.799,2.88,where even though you're simulating a
1890.0,2.64,low temperature system
1891.679,2.401,you
1892.64,3.2,do some fairly
1894.08,4.959,mild compression and you get something
1895.84,3.199,that looks closer to infrared
1901.12,3.279,maybe one comment also coming back to
1902.96,3.28,this error correction full tolerance is
1904.399,4.241,that of course if you have errors in
1906.24,4.559,your circuit you also have an ensemble
1908.64,4.639,of circuits and if it's full tolerant
1910.799,4.561,then you're below threshold and it is
1913.279,4.64,keeping its functionality
1915.36,5.84,right but if you're if you're not or you
1917.919,6.48,haven't designed it well then you are
1921.2,4.8,it's losing its functionality so
1924.399,4.101,i think that that's maybe the best
1926.0,4.96,example i can think of that it's
1928.5,4.299,[Music]
1930.96,4.4,sorry there was a there's a related
1932.799,4.88,point that for shivaji you know when you
1935.36,3.76,spoke about your time crystal experiment
1937.679,2.88,there was there's something that you
1939.12,4.0,brought up which i didn't fully
1940.559,3.921,understand so so you said well
1943.12,3.84,look um
1944.48,4.24,normally you'll be you'd be probing the
1946.96,3.92,you know you're you're being in an
1948.72,4.559,equilibrium phase where you're probing
1950.88,4.08,the low energy states and and here what
1953.279,3.76,you're what you're saying is you you
1954.96,4.959,find ordering throughout the hilbert
1957.039,4.961,space uh you know including at you know
1959.919,3.841,your high energy eigenstate so can you
1962.0,4.159,can you see a little bit more about that
1963.76,2.399,just to
1968.0,5.039,well um
1970.559,5.12,but let me um
1973.039,3.76,let me describe it this way so
1975.679,2.72,you know
1976.799,2.48,this was a flowcare problem but there's
1978.399,2.321,a
1979.279,5.041,similar statement
1980.72,6.079,you know the paper we we first wrote um
1984.32,4.32,you know david hughes and
1986.799,4.321,myself and
1988.64,2.48,i won't list
1991.76,2.56,um
1992.799,3.281,it's called localization protected
1994.32,4.8,quantum order so that one was actually
1996.08,5.439,on the transverse field eisenhower
1999.12,4.72,uh with random bonds and random fields
2001.519,3.921,this is actually a a very well studied
2003.84,3.52,problem there was a lot of work on this
2005.44,3.76,before we came along
2007.36,4.799,now what's interesting is that when you
2009.2,5.28,work on that phase diagram
2012.159,3.921,using
2014.48,3.6,the tools of statistical mechanics if
2016.08,3.52,you say i'll just take that hamiltonian
2018.08,3.52,and calculate the properties of e to the
2019.6,3.04,minus beta h
2021.6,3.679,then
2022.64,3.68,you can't find any order at any non-zero
2025.279,3.041,temperature because that's the
2026.32,3.839,celebrated theorem in
2028.32,4.16,electrical mechanics that you cannot
2030.159,5.601,break a discrete symmetry in one
2032.48,5.439,dimension about zero temperature
2035.76,3.84,so all you have is what you would call
2037.919,3.281,the parameter
2039.6,3.12,so
2041.2,3.68,but when you examine the individual
2042.72,4.319,eigenstates of the hamiltonian
2044.88,3.999,going all the way up uh you know
2047.039,3.84,in energy at least in the in the case
2048.879,3.841,which is described by by free fermion it
2050.879,4.401,gets more complicated
2052.72,4.32,but but it
2055.28,3.599,it doesn't really matter the point is in
2057.04,3.359,the statistical mechanical version what
2058.879,3.441,should have happened was that any
2060.399,5.2,non-zero energy density above the ground
2062.32,5.599,state should have given you no cementite
2065.599,3.841,and in fact you get it at non-zero
2067.919,3.44,energy densities and in this special
2069.44,3.439,case you get it at any energy density
2071.359,3.841,whatsoever so that's the case where you
2072.879,3.601,have a hamiltonian you can be very sharp
2075.2,3.28,because you can define the energy
2076.48,3.76,density with respect to the hamiltonian
2078.48,4.0,but the floquet unitary
2080.24,4.399,right since the unitary
2082.48,4.32,is not really an energy
2084.639,4.161,so it's sort of the but what you can ask
2086.8,4.16,is how close you are to a certain kind
2088.8,4.319,of state maybe you know you start with
2090.96,3.84,let's say all spins up and you get very
2093.119,3.681,far from it but in the case of the
2094.8,4.48,hamiltonian problem the localization
2096.8,4.319,protected order is very striking it
2099.28,5.6,really violates
2101.119,5.681,this theorem which you know goes back to
2104.88,4.4,landau which is that you cannot break
2106.8,4.96,discrete symmetries
2109.28,5.12,at nonzero temperatures in one dimension
2111.76,4.96,continuous symmetries two dimension
2114.4,4.0,that's the movements
2116.72,4.0,and localization allows you to get
2118.4,2.32,around
2126.72,6.48,i don't know is that quite
2130.4,5.199,yeah um i'm not i'm not sure i
2133.2,4.639,completely understood you know so so the
2135.599,5.041,sense i got was that um
2137.839,5.041,you know this was this was exploring the
2140.64,5.84,the high energy part of the spectrum not
2142.88,6.239,just the low energy part so is that
2146.48,5.2,you know to to to what extent is that
2149.119,3.701,unique to this expert you know so is is
2151.68,3.04,that something that um
2152.82,4.46,[Music]
2154.72,5.04,so you know just in terms of well you
2157.28,4.319,know probing hilbert space which parts
2159.76,3.44,can you probe and not prove in
2161.599,4.561,experiments so can you say a little bit
2163.2,5.04,about place this in the in the
2166.16,3.04,you know in context and
2168.24,2.96,sure
2169.2,4.8,so i guess there are two issues one is
2171.2,5.36,as an as an experimental matter if i
2174.0,4.24,give you a solid
2176.56,3.519,right and you try and heat it up it's
2178.24,3.76,got degrees of freedom you know there's
2180.079,3.52,a locally unbounded space so you're
2182.0,3.04,going to keep heating
2183.599,3.281,and
2185.04,3.6,so there's in a sense you don't get to
2186.88,4.16,infinite temperature just because you
2188.64,3.76,know things keep happening
2191.04,2.96,um now
2192.4,4.56,if you have a
2194.0,4.8,model system which which is um
2196.96,3.92,has a locally bounded hilbert space cube
2198.8,4.319,it's
2200.88,3.76,then of course for spin systems or qubit
2203.119,4.081,systems you can
2204.64,4.16,sensibly talk about you know the sort of
2207.2,3.04,configuration which you would think of
2208.8,3.76,as being infinite temperature very high
2210.24,2.32,energy
2213.04,3.92,which is hard to do if you if you can
2215.04,3.2,just keep absorbing energy
2216.96,3.6,forever
2218.24,4.4,so within this more restricted class of
2220.56,4.08,systems which you either will realize to
2222.64,3.92,a good approximation
2224.64,4.16,basically ultimately anything has
2226.56,4.08,degrees of freedom going you know
2228.8,3.279,out forever so what you really need is
2230.64,2.719,that the local degree of freedom comes
2232.079,3.441,with some gap
2233.359,3.361,right so that you're able to sensibly
2235.52,3.92,excite
2236.72,4.32,things below the gap and not not above
2239.44,4.159,it
2241.04,4.16,too much so
2243.599,3.921,once you've accepted this locally
2245.2,4.399,bounded hyperspace description then
2247.52,4.0,you know then there's this distinction
2249.599,3.121,between finding interesting things
2251.52,2.96,happening
2252.72,3.84,for states which are very high energy
2254.48,3.76,with respect to hamiltonian
2256.56,3.12,and
2258.24,2.879,not finding something interesting so in
2259.68,3.36,the traditional understanding of
2261.119,3.601,statistical mechanics
2263.04,3.2,you wouldn't expect to find anything
2264.72,3.119,particularly interesting because the
2266.24,2.96,thermal density matrix at infinite
2267.839,3.041,temperature is just you know e to the
2269.2,3.12,minus beta h with beta equals zero so
2270.88,3.28,you're just taking a totally
2272.32,3.519,unrestricted average
2274.16,3.439,over all states
2275.839,3.76,um
2277.599,3.921,and um
2279.599,3.361,so
2281.52,3.76,so in this case
2282.96,4.72,that the fact that you can see things in
2285.28,4.88,individual eigenstates
2287.68,4.0,eth is the is the other way to look at
2290.16,3.28,it which is to say that every individual
2291.68,3.52,eigen state is supposed to reproduce for
2293.44,2.96,you the statistical mechanical density
2295.2,2.32,matrix
2296.4,4.0,and here
2297.52,4.4,these high energy states don't do that
2300.4,4.719,so there's special states which is where
2301.92,3.199,the localization comes
2307.92,2.0,great
2309.04,2.72,um
2309.92,3.06,this there's one more question from our
2311.76,3.92,second
2312.98,4.859,[Music]
2315.68,4.32,hi hi shivaji
2317.839,2.161,hi
2320.8,5.12,nice to see you um
2323.359,4.641,so i wrote the question down so it's
2325.92,4.4,hopefully clear
2328.0,4.72,tfnp is the complexity class which
2330.32,4.32,contains np problem
2332.72,4.24,problems with the property that every
2334.64,4.16,input has a witness i hope that makes
2336.96,4.159,sense
2338.8,5.52,so there are np problems for which it is
2341.119,5.201,guaranteed that there is uh like a
2344.32,3.519,witness that satisfies the problem right
2346.32,3.92,that's a special
2347.839,4.481,uh subclass of np
2350.24,4.16,uh there seems to be a connection of the
2352.32,4.48,to the topic of the talk today in the
2354.4,3.12,sense that in the relevant phase that
2356.8,3.6,you
2357.52,6.24,mentioned there is always a periodicity
2360.4,5.12,uh but i'm wondering if there is um
2363.76,2.88,hard or interesting computational
2365.52,4.319,problem
2366.64,4.88,uh that might be hiding here for example
2369.839,3.121,um
2371.52,3.92,finding
2372.96,4.72,the the um
2375.44,4.24,you mentioned that there is a time limit
2377.68,3.679,under after which
2379.68,3.84,you would get back to your original
2381.359,4.321,state for example so for example maybe
2383.52,3.44,it's hard to find that time
2385.68,3.679,um
2386.96,4.399,you also mentioned that there are pairs
2389.359,4.081,there so maybe you know given one state
2391.359,3.441,find it's you know it's evil twin things
2393.44,3.36,like that
2394.8,3.84,um
2396.8,4.4,i i'm not sure if the second problem
2398.64,2.56,made sense
2401.359,4.401,i i'm actually have to say as i'm
2403.2,3.68,reading i i have as you'll remember from
2405.76,3.2,the old days a very limited
2406.88,4.0,understanding of such matters so
2408.96,2.96,i tend to think of a witness mostly i
2410.88,2.719,think
2411.92,5.04,um so i guess this is the kind of
2413.599,6.24,witness is not a solution and it's still
2416.96,4.24,still hard that's so big can i kind of
2419.839,4.561,translate slightly
2421.2,3.2,go ahead go ahead so
2424.8,4.319,correct me or uh if i'm getting this
2427.119,2.801,wrong but but um
2429.119,2.801,but
2429.92,3.28,maybe what what what ora is saying is
2431.92,2.64,that look um
2433.2,2.56,you know you have these systems where
2434.56,2.48,you're saying
2435.76,3.52,you know you're driving them at a
2437.04,4.079,certain certain frequency but then you
2439.28,4.72,see period some other completely
2441.119,4.48,different period show up uh in terms of
2444.0,3.76,the dynamics
2445.599,3.681,um or there's some other pattern that
2447.76,3.52,shows up so there's some pattern that
2449.28,4.24,shows up once you actually do the
2451.28,3.039,quantum revolution and the question is
2453.52,2.72,well
2454.319,3.441,is is is this something that might
2456.24,4.48,actually be hard to
2457.76,5.2,find you know so so in other words you
2460.72,4.48,set up the system and you have no idea
2462.96,4.159,what this what this pattern is and once
2465.2,4.159,you you know once you find it you can
2467.119,3.841,verify it and so on but uh
2469.359,4.24,you know could it be that these are hard
2470.96,4.56,computational problems hiding in in
2473.599,3.52,yours in your in the definition of your
2475.52,4.16,system
2477.119,4.321,i mean it's an
2479.68,4.56,really interesting talk because in terms
2481.44,4.56,of using the these systems
2484.24,4.079,as experimental devices and going
2486.0,3.92,hunting for interesting things
2488.319,3.441,i think aura's question would come up
2489.92,4.56,namely if you saw something interesting
2491.76,3.52,would you would you recognize it
2494.48,2.8,um
2495.28,3.28,right which is i mean
2497.28,2.799,physicists
2498.56,3.039,tend to have a standard you know we tend
2500.079,3.361,to think about the correlation functions
2501.599,3.361,local expectation values you know
2503.44,2.879,looking for certain kinds of order we
2504.96,3.2,have a list of things and you could
2506.319,3.52,imagine looking for that
2508.16,3.52,um
2509.839,4.081,yeah i don't know just like for a
2511.68,5.12,concrete example do you know how hard it
2513.92,5.04,is to find the period itself like the
2516.8,4.4,the time in which the periodicity
2518.96,4.399,appears
2521.2,3.2,uh again maybe i'm not getting the
2523.359,2.96,that's the real question but you know
2524.4,3.439,something like periodicity and you're
2526.319,4.161,putting a transform when you look for a
2527.839,4.961,peak i mean generally finding a period
2530.48,4.32,in some time series
2532.8,4.08,isn't that big a deal as long as the
2534.8,4.319,quantity that in who you're looking for
2536.88,2.959,a period is relatively easy to measure
2539.119,2.451,now
2539.839,3.52,maybe sorry i think
2541.57,4.35,[Music]
2543.359,4.801,if i understand correctly or is asking
2545.92,4.48,you know so suppose you suppose you had
2548.16,4.24,a certain experiment in mind
2550.4,3.6,would you be able to predict what period
2552.4,3.36,you should see before you actually
2554.0,3.599,perform the experiment or would it be
2555.76,4.319,the experiment that reveals it to you
2557.599,4.48,and that you know if you if if you were
2560.079,3.361,trying to compute it especially if you
2562.079,3.04,were trying to compute it classically
2563.44,3.679,you wouldn't have a hope uh you know is
2565.119,3.441,that is that possible in this in the
2567.119,2.321,kinds of systems that you were looking
2568.56,1.759,at
2569.44,3.28,okay so
2570.319,4.0,let me try and repeat it in a way that i
2572.72,4.0,think i understand so is the question
2574.319,5.201,supposing you had it you had a set of
2576.72,4.24,local unitaries
2579.52,3.76,which certainly need a fundamental
2580.96,3.76,period to begin with
2583.28,4.4,and the question is
2584.72,5.04,does the actual evolution show some
2587.68,3.52,multiple or some you know
2589.76,3.92,do something else does it break that
2591.2,4.0,time translation symmetry in some way
2593.68,4.24,and
2595.2,4.48,can you say in advance i mean how easy
2597.92,4.0,would it be to
2599.68,5.6,you know to understand it i
2601.92,6.08,i don't know i mean it's the
2605.28,4.96,a good question i mean it because
2608.0,2.88,in the limit of a large system you have
2610.24,2.96,a
2610.88,4.0,and it's like a huge hamiltonian unitary
2613.2,3.28,right i mean it's uh
2614.88,3.12,any naive before it certainly is not
2616.48,3.04,going to be
2618.0,3.2,in this case as barbara said at the
2619.52,3.36,start you know if you knew what we were
2621.2,4.159,doing what you're asking
2622.88,4.959,are there other things uh i i don't
2625.359,4.0,that doesn't seem easy to me maybe
2627.839,3.441,someone else has an answer but the
2629.359,3.681,disorder is also important here right
2631.28,4.96,shivaji you have to have you have a
2633.04,5.12,family of hamiltonians with this sort of
2636.24,3.68,right and that's what makes average
2638.16,2.959,quantities that's part of the question
2639.92,2.72,you don't have to average because every
2641.119,3.2,single disorder realization will
2642.64,2.88,eventually show this behavior at long
2644.319,2.721,times
2645.52,3.12,but you're going to have to wait a long
2647.04,3.92,time before you see it so that's what
2648.64,4.16,the phenomenon is robust but one reason
2650.96,3.359,it's difficult to guess is because it's
2652.8,3.12,not something that just stares you in
2654.319,3.841,the face when you start it's not a few
2655.92,5.88,period phenomena it's a long time
2658.16,3.64,large system phenomenon
2662.96,3.84,if there were other things like that
2664.64,3.76,they might well be hard too
2666.8,4.4,yeah actually that also leads to the
2668.4,4.959,question that i had is indeed that um
2671.2,4.8,you know for what other hamiltonians
2673.359,5.121,come on make these predictions because
2676.0,4.64,you know this of course is uh zz and
2678.48,4.16,then a transfer field that this that is
2680.64,3.76,matching the experiment very well but
2682.64,3.6,are there other candidates um that
2684.4,3.679,people have been looking at and that are
2686.24,4.56,experimentally
2688.079,4.0,um you know close or say
2690.8,4.319,of course you could they make small
2692.079,4.721,variants of these circuits that are
2695.119,3.601,i mean i don't know if another okay
2696.8,3.76,hamiltonian very different which is you
2698.72,4.399,know it's predicted to show period
2700.56,4.48,doubling their other flowcase which show
2703.119,3.281,other periods you know i mean part of
2705.04,4.0,this class of things this is the
2706.4,2.64,simplest one
2712.4,5.12,great so i think we are we are
2715.2,4.639,approaching the end of the panel period
2717.52,3.839,so if if anybody has any quick thoughts
2719.839,4.801,on the panel or
2721.359,3.281,anything else to add
2725.599,2.72,actually maybe again since bedroom is
2727.28,2.72,here
2728.319,2.961,you mentioned that
2730.0,3.28,800 to
2731.28,5.039,eight
2733.28,4.079,nanoseconds of the champion
2736.319,3.04,can you
2737.359,3.76,tell us what the what the physics
2739.359,2.881,challenges are that
2741.119,3.601,sort of
2742.24,6.24,um because the
2744.72,5.84,right um because uh there is a qubit and
2748.48,5.52,you read out the state by coupling it
2750.56,5.44,with a linear resonator if you couple it
2754.0,4.4,strongly so and then you're looking for
2756.0,3.28,the state of that resonator
2758.4,2.719,to be
2759.28,3.44,their frequency resonance frequency of
2761.119,3.601,that resonator shifts a little bit
2762.72,4.48,depending on your qubit to be occupied
2764.72,4.08,by is it zero or one shift that
2767.2,3.6,resonance frequency a little bit and
2768.8,4.4,you're looking for that shift
2770.8,4.0,so uh but since you want to read it out
2773.2,3.2,that's a
2774.8,3.6,challenging balance
2776.4,4.4,that if you couple it strongly so you
2778.4,4.48,can quickly read it out but then you
2780.8,4.24,decohere your system faster if you
2782.88,4.64,couple weekly then you have to integrate
2785.04,5.52,for longer time to recognize how much
2787.52,6.079,the resonance frequency have shifted so
2790.56,4.72,uh uh that that's the challenge uh and
2793.599,3.201,it is a big challenge for error
2795.28,3.2,correction but
2796.8,3.44,for nisk usually when you would have
2798.48,3.68,measurement at the end
2800.24,5.28,it's not a challenge yeah i mean it's
2802.16,3.36,major challenge for feedback
2807.28,3.92,but i hope we can come up with lots of
2809.04,6.92,exciting physics that you just need to
2811.2,4.76,read the states of cubit once at the end
2820.88,2.88,great um
2822.88,3.6,well
2823.76,5.2,maybe um yeah we can
2826.48,4.24,you know that was
2828.96,4.8,possibly this is a good
2830.72,4.639,stop so uh thanks everybody thanks thank
2833.76,4.24,you especially uh
2835.359,4.401,you know adam barbara and pedram for for
2838.0,3.92,being on the panel and thank you shivaji
2839.76,2.16,for
2843.359,2.881,and of uh
2844.64,4.719,thanks to the audience for
2846.24,5.599,for uh great questions
2849.359,4.48,thank you for inviting us off to join
2851.839,6.361,thank you very much thank you
2853.839,4.361,thanks a lot thanks bye
