you can't have ai without data science
or is it the other way around
[Music]
ai and data science are two very popular
buzzwords in it
they often work hand in hand but do have
differences in enterprise use cases
ai refers to a computer's ability to
understand learn from
and make decisions based on data like
humans current ai is limited to where
humans can train it
with heaps and heaps of data on very
very specific topics
specifically this is called machine
learning data science is a field of
study
that examines the large data sets with
various analytics methods
including machine learning and pattern
discovery to extract valuable business
insights
data science can be useful to build
recommendation engines
predict user behavior make business
decisions and more
data science is a broad term focusing on
algorithms and statistics as well as
data processing and interpretation
using ai for the prediction automation
and pattern discovery part of the field
so if a data scientist wanted to improve
a specific business process
then they would first use data science
to gain business intelligence
on the process how it could be improved
or common errors
then they would turn to ai to improve
logistics
or streamline and automate the process
in part or in whole
data science is compromised of a highly
involved set of statistical models
that data scientists manipulate and pull
insight from because of the human
involvement
various types of data and data formats
can be used
ai on the other hand is not a set of
processes it's a computer ability that
is
ideally self-sustaining to improve or
aid business processes
so it requires clean labeled data sets
that its algorithms can handle
independently
additionally data science is statistics
based
constructed to gain the highest level of
business intelligence
while ai is algorithm-based modeled
after human thinking processes
it intends to predict future events
learn from its own mistakes
and lead to more focused processes like
machine learning or deep learning
machine learning is just one tool for
developing new insights
