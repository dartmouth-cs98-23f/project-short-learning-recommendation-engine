0.179,4.561,it's a weekend and John decided to watch
2.82,3.9,the latest movie recommended by Netflix
4.74,4.02,at his friend's place
6.72,4.62,before heading out he asked Siri about
8.76,4.919,the weather and realized it would rain
11.34,4.499,so he decided to take his Tesla for the
13.679,3.481,long journey and switched to autopilot
15.839,3.121,on the highway
17.16,4.26,after coming home from the eventful day
18.96,4.14,he started wondering how technology has
21.42,3.359,made his life easy
23.1,4.08,he did some research on the internet and
24.779,4.74,found out that Netflix Siri and Tesla
27.18,4.32,are all using AI
29.519,4.981,so what is AI
31.5,4.92,AI or artificial intelligence is nothing
34.5,4.86,but making computers-based machines
36.42,5.28,think and act like humans artificial
39.36,4.62,intelligence is not a new term John
41.7,4.379,McCarthy a computer scientist coined the
43.98,5.64,term artificial intelligence back in
46.079,5.82,1956 but it took time to evolve as it
49.62,4.619,demanded heavy computing power
51.899,4.201,artificial intelligence is not confined
54.239,3.241,to just movie recommendations and
56.1,3.72,virtual assistants
57.48,5.099,broadly classifying there are three
59.82,5.699,types of AI artificial narrow
62.579,4.681,intelligence also called weak AI is the
65.519,4.741,stage where machines can perform a
67.26,5.16,specific task Netflix Siri chat Bots
70.26,4.02,spatial recommendation systems are all
72.42,3.059,examples of artificial narrow
74.28,3.54,intelligence
75.479,4.381,next up we have artificial general
77.82,3.659,intelligence referred to as an
79.86,3.66,intelligent agent's capacity to
81.479,3.78,comprehend or pick up any intellectual
83.52,3.599,skill that a human can
85.259,4.741,we are halfway in a successfully
87.119,5.941,implementing this space IBM's Watson
90.0,6.119,supercomputer and gpt3 fall under this
93.06,4.32,category and lastly artificial super
96.119,3.241,intelligence
97.38,4.379,it is the stage where machines surpass
99.36,4.2,human intelligence you might have seen
101.759,4.261,this in movies and imagined how the
103.56,4.68,world would be if machines occupied
106.02,3.779,fascinated by this John did more
108.24,3.48,research and found out that machine
109.799,3.96,learning deep learning and natural
111.72,4.259,language processing are all connected
113.759,4.921,with artificial intelligence
115.979,4.741,machine learning a subset of AI is the
118.68,3.84,process of automating and enhancing how
120.72,3.96,computers learn from their experiences
122.52,3.959,without human health
124.68,5.34,machine learning can be used in email
126.479,5.701,spam detection medical diagnosis Etc
130.02,4.2,deep learning can be considered a subset
132.18,4.02,of machine learning it is a field that
134.22,4.98,is based on learning and improving on
136.2,4.98,its own by examining computer algorithms
139.2,4.08,while machine learning uses simpler
141.18,4.02,Concepts deep learning works with
143.28,4.44,artificial neural networks which are
145.2,4.08,designed to imitate the human brain this
147.72,4.019,technology can be applied in face
149.28,4.8,recognition speech recognition and many
151.739,6.181,more applications natural language
154.08,5.82,processing popularly known as NLP can be
157.92,3.84,defined as the ability of machines to
159.9,4.86,learn human language and translate it
161.76,5.82,chat Bots fall under this category
164.76,4.68,artificial intelligence is advancing in
167.58,5.04,every crucial field like healthcare
169.44,6.06,education robotics banking e-commerce
172.62,6.0,and the list goes on like in healthcare
175.5,4.68,AI is used to identify diseases helping
178.62,3.54,healthcare service providers and their
180.18,3.66,patients make better treatment and
182.16,4.2,lifestyle decisions
183.84,4.08,coming to the education sector AI is
186.36,3.78,helping teachers automate grading
187.92,4.679,organizing and facilitating parent
190.14,5.099,Guardian conversations
192.599,5.041,in robotics ai-powered robots employ
195.239,4.621,real-time updates to detect obstructions
197.64,4.62,in their path and instantaneously design
199.86,4.799,their routes artificial intelligence
202.26,4.86,provides Advanced data analytics that is
204.659,4.321,transforming banking by reducing fraud
207.12,4.619,and enhancing compliance
208.98,4.619,with this growing demand for AI more and
211.739,3.661,more Industries are looking for AI
213.599,3.72,Engineers who can help them develop
215.4,4.14,intelligent systems and offer them
217.319,4.261,lucrative salaries going north of one
219.54,4.5,hundred and twenty thousand dollars
221.58,5.28,future of AI looks promising with the AI
224.04,4.86,Market expected to reach 190 billion
226.86,4.62,dollars by 2025.
228.9,3.3,so on that note I have a question for
231.48,3.179,you
232.2,5.039,artificial intelligence is about playing
234.659,4.86,a computer game creating a device using
237.239,4.741,your own intelligence to program an
239.519,4.201,intelligent machine investing your brain
241.98,3.539,power in a machine
243.72,3.72,give the correct answer along with your
245.519,4.44,reasoning and stand a chance to win an
247.44,4.379,Amazon voucher think about it and leave
249.959,4.321,your answers in the comments section and
