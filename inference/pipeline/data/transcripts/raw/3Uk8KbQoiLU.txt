11.76,5.279,tography broadly is the practice and
14.88,3.6,study of techniques for secure
17.039,3.981,communication
18.48,6.0,in the presence of adversarial Behavior
21.02,5.08,so you know do you have information do
24.48,3.9,you want to keep it a secret
26.1,6.919,how do you keep it a secret
28.38,4.639,um is you know is kind of the pipeline
35.1,6.0,the way we know something is secure if I
37.92,5.459,wanted to you know prove it to you if I
41.1,4.08,wanted you to like not just take my word
43.379,3.36,for it that if I tell you something is
45.18,4.5,secure
46.739,5.701,um you'll have to do two things first we
49.68,4.44,have to Define an adversary
52.44,3.299,um or in combination with an adversary
54.12,5.16,we have to Define what's called a
55.739,6.62,security model so this is a set of
59.28,5.839,basically just mathematical operations
62.359,5.321,and these mathematical operations
65.119,5.201,rigorously Define everything that the
67.68,4.02,adversary is allowed to do so maybe
70.32,3.42,they're allowed to look at messages
71.7,5.34,before I encrypt them maybe they're
73.74,5.16,allowed to to look at you know some
77.04,4.68,encrypted messages and then they're
78.9,4.74,allowed to see uh the decrypted version
81.72,3.899,and there's all sorts of different
83.64,4.2,behaviors and scenarios that you can
85.619,4.86,Define with math in order to model
87.84,5.459,different types of adversaries that
90.479,5.46,would model different scenarios where
93.299,4.081,you'd want to protect information and so
95.939,4.741,once you've made all of these
97.38,6.059,mathematical definitions you construct a
100.68,4.14,communication protocol so this is a
103.439,4.801,mathematic this is a series of
104.82,5.1,mathematical operations that model uh
108.24,3.68,multiple people talking to each other
109.92,4.8,sending messages
111.92,5.08,which consists of just bits back and
114.72,4.98,forth between each other and once you've
117.0,6.18,defined that protocol you mathematically
119.7,5.699,prove that the adversary cannot break
123.18,6.359,your protocols so you prove that they
125.399,7.2,can't learn information basically and so
129.539,5.221,the techniques to do this can be can go
132.599,5.041,from very simple to just proving it's
134.76,4.28,hard to to figure out like the factors
137.64,4.38,of a number
139.04,5.02,to extremely complicated problems that
142.02,4.799,like you know people would study you
144.06,4.319,know for like their PHD topics
146.819,3.42,um or something so I'm not going to
148.379,4.021,really go into any specific construction
150.239,5.041,but I do just want you guys to
152.4,5.339,understand the process of we
155.28,5.819,mathematically construct
157.739,5.58,um an adversary that tries to break our
161.099,4.741,to that tries to break our code
163.319,5.28,and then we prove that they can't break
165.84,4.32,it and so just to give
168.599,4.381,um an example
170.16,5.939,um this is a high level view of what's
172.98,4.86,called into end encryption which is how
176.099,4.381,you would communicate some with someone
177.84,4.979,securely over over a chat application
180.48,4.92,like WhatsApp or signal or Facebook
182.819,5.221,Messenger so every time you use WhatsApp
185.4,5.88,or Facebook messenger and you talk to
188.04,5.419,someone this process is occurring with
191.28,5.039,these mathematical key exchanges
193.459,4.721,encrypting messages sending encrypted
196.319,3.42,messages decrypting them with certain
198.18,2.12,Keys
199.739,2.881,um
200.3,4.24,and we start with like a high level
202.62,3.899,description of this process and then we
204.54,5.779,work our way down getting more and more
206.519,3.8,specific with um with the math
211.019,5.341,you know I just said you know we have to
213.18,5.4,prove uh that our you know our adversary
216.36,4.5,which I've called a here so we have to
218.58,3.42,prove that adversary a can't break our
220.86,4.019,scheme
222.0,4.5,and the way that we do these uh these
224.879,4.021,mathematical proofs because I'm not
226.5,3.86,going to really give you an example
228.9,3.72,um
230.36,5.14,just because I don't want to like throw
232.62,6.42,you know math at you is that
235.5,7.44,you use a you use the adversary we made
239.04,7.199,this mathematical set of operations that
242.94,5.579,we consider to be like enemy Behavior
246.239,3.661,and you use it to solve a problem you
248.519,4.5,know is hard
249.9,5.399,so you have an adversary you have a
253.019,5.881,problem that you know for a fact is hard
255.299,6.961,or maybe even impossible and you prove
258.9,5.64,that if the adversary exists and can do
262.26,3.12,damage to your like if it can break your
264.54,3.96,code
265.38,5.759,you prove that you've actually solved
268.5,5.4,the problem you knew that was hard and
271.139,4.861,so this is a contradiction we are saying
273.9,4.38,that you know I have this problem I know
276.0,4.38,is impossible and I have a solution to
278.28,4.38,the problem that doesn't make any sense
280.38,5.16,so that means that like the abilities
282.66,5.4,that I said that this adversary had
285.54,5.219,um in order to like solve in order to
288.06,4.8,break our encryption to break our code
290.759,3.801,um it can't exist
292.86,4.5,um
294.56,4.9,and so one another way of phrasing this
297.36,4.44,is that we assume that whatever
299.46,4.799,communication protocol or encryption
301.8,4.02,scheme we were making is weak against
304.259,4.321,the adversary
305.82,5.76,and then assuming that weakness we are
308.58,6.54,able to build a solution to a hard
311.58,6.36,problem B and kind of the simplest hard
315.12,4.2,problem that um I'll give you guys as an
317.94,2.9,example
319.32,4.08,um is
320.84,5.44,determining the factors of number of
323.4,4.5,really really big numbers
326.28,4.139,um so if I give you a really really big
327.9,5.4,number and I ask you to pull out a
330.419,5.761,specific like prime factor
333.3,5.52,um so a number that divides that number
336.18,5.519,um this is a this is a problem that is
338.82,5.879,um in in theory hard to solve
341.699,5.28,um at least on a normal computer and by
344.699,4.081,hard here I just mean it takes a long
346.979,3.601,time so
348.78,3.18,um unless you have a very special type
350.58,3.78,of encryption called information
351.96,5.519,theoretic encryption
354.36,5.339,um you can eventually break any code or
357.479,4.981,any encryption scheme however if it
359.699,4.861,takes a really long time uh no one is
362.46,4.56,going to break it so it's you know it's
364.56,4.5,safe enough for human for like humans
367.02,4.5,for human use
369.06,6.3,um and how long it might take to break
371.52,6.0,it uh might you know allow you to use
375.36,4.44,different encryption schemes that are
377.52,6.119,maybe faster or slower for different
379.8,6.899,purposes so so you know encrypting your
383.639,6.241,bank account transactions for example is
386.699,5.461,probably more important than like your
389.88,3.84,Snapchats with like your friend or maybe
392.16,3.0,I don't know what you send to maybe
393.72,3.599,you're sending your bank transactions on
395.16,3.599,Snapchat but you know maybe don't do
397.319,4.021,that
398.759,5.101,um but
401.34,5.699,if you know we basically want like we
403.86,5.58,want harder and harder problems uh to
407.039,3.78,solve like and protect more and more
409.44,3.72,secure information
410.819,5.94,and I know this might seem a little
413.16,5.34,abstract to you guys so just um to think
416.759,3.0,about it in terms of the Python code
418.5,2.699,that we've been working with the past
419.759,3.541,two weeks
421.199,4.861,um one way to think about this is that
423.3,5.1,we use the adversary a like a python
426.06,5.46,function so we have a python function
428.4,5.519,that is our adversary and if I give that
431.52,4.26,adversary some data it will spit back
433.919,3.241,the answer to a really really hard
435.78,3.9,problem
437.16,5.28,um a problem that I know is too hard for
439.68,5.1,it to actually solve so I know that this
442.44,5.28,that this you know this function uh
444.78,5.34,doesn't actually exist it's not real
447.72,5.16,um and if I know it's not real then I
450.12,5.76,know my system is safe
452.88,4.5,and just to like reiterate this idea of
455.88,2.46,contradiction
457.38,3.12,um you know here's a little Phoenix
458.34,3.96,right you know
460.5,4.199,if we have a clear contradiction between
462.3,4.739,the existence of an adversary and the
464.699,5.461,heart and the hardness of a problem one
467.039,5.641,of them has to be wrong and if we
470.16,4.8,already have a proof for the problem uh
472.68,4.079,that's supposed to be hard I know it's I
474.96,4.82,know it's the adversary and I know that
476.759,3.021,my system is safe
481.44,5.699,how does that intersect with machine
483.12,6.06,learning so there's two forms that I
487.139,4.261,think are good to consider
489.18,3.9,um one is more theoretical and one is
491.4,3.72,more practical
493.08,4.14,so first
495.12,4.799,um our cert we can think about doing
497.22,6.36,cryptography with machine learning and
499.919,5.941,so what I mean by this is you know can I
503.58,5.459,use a machine learning problem in a
505.86,4.44,crypto in a cryptography scheme so if I
509.039,3.661,have a really really hard machine
510.3,4.32,learning problem maybe I can use that
512.7,4.079,problem to hide information because the
514.62,4.44,problem's just too hard to solve and so
516.779,4.2,that's a more theoretical problem where
519.06,3.479,we're like building you know encryption
520.979,4.261,schemes
522.539,4.621,um on the other hand more practically
525.24,3.96,um machine your machine Learning System
527.16,4.799,that you might build for you know any
529.2,5.579,reason is using data sets right you're
531.959,4.621,you're usually collecting data in like a
534.779,4.74,supervised problem or an unsupervised
536.58,4.56,problem and that data might need to be
539.519,3.481,secured it might be really sensitive
541.14,4.379,like maybe you're trying to do like
543.0,5.04,cancer diagnoses well if you want to do
545.519,5.101,real cancer diagnoses you have to have
548.04,4.5,databases from hospitals so hospitals
550.62,3.36,have to actually give you like patient
552.54,3.299,data
553.98,4.74,um and you have to keep that data secure
555.839,4.381,you have to make sure no one leaks it
558.72,4.08,um otherwise you know you're violating
560.22,4.86,basically the Hippocratic Oath that you
562.8,4.26,know all that like this hospital is is
565.08,3.24,legally obligated and you know morally
567.06,3.48,obligated
568.32,4.86,um to keep safe
570.54,4.5,and so we have this theoretical View and
573.18,5.58,this more practical View
575.04,6.419,and so you know if you won again doing
578.76,4.5,cryptography with machine learning if
581.459,4.981,some problems are not easily learnable
583.26,6.66,they're really good for cryptography
586.44,5.88,and on the other hand if um you know
589.92,5.099,maybe the security of a cryptography
592.32,4.74,scheme is not exactly clear so maybe
595.019,4.32,there's a problem that I think is hard
597.06,4.1,and that I'm using for a cryptography
599.339,4.5,scheme but I don't really know it's hard
601.16,4.179,well the thing that really decides how
603.839,4.081,hard it is is whether you can learn
605.339,5.281,anything about it so if I have a problem
607.92,4.74,I'm not quite sure is hard I could try
610.62,5.04,doing machine learning
612.66,6.06,on the on the scheme on the problem and
615.66,5.1,if it finds anything then I know that
618.72,4.02,this problem I was considering was hard
620.76,4.079,is actually
622.74,4.26,um there's some issues with it
624.839,3.421,um so you know I can use cryptography I
627.0,3.66,can use machine learning to try and
628.26,5.1,build a cryptographic scheme or I can
630.66,6.38,use it to try and break one
633.36,6.36,um now uh using it to build uh crypto
637.04,4.06,cryptographic schemes is very well
639.72,3.6,understood
641.1,3.78,um one way to think about it is that if
643.32,2.519,you have a learning problem if you have
644.88,2.88,something you want to do machine
645.839,4.94,learning with that is inherently
647.76,6.36,unpredictable then it's inherently
650.779,5.321,unlearnable and so you know if you can
654.12,4.08,construct this learning problem that you
656.1,4.679,can't solve then it's good to use for
658.2,5.879,cryptography and
660.779,6.841,um some examples of this might be like
664.079,7.2,learning a like a perfectly like random
667.62,5.82,uh function so if I like am just sending
671.279,4.861,numbers to random numbers there's no
673.44,5.22,pattern in that I can't like I can't
676.14,5.28,learn anything so I could use that to
678.66,5.4,make certain cryptographic schemes
681.42,4.44,um on the other hand I am not really
684.06,4.32,even though people regularly publish
685.86,5.76,research on this I'm not confident that
688.38,5.16,throwing machine learning at um at like
691.62,4.2,cryptography schemes you're not sure is
693.54,5.4,are secure is necessarily that useful to
695.82,5.759,do it kind of breaks you know the
698.94,4.68,mathematical rigorousness or the math
701.579,4.561,medical rigor that I was saying we need
703.62,4.74,earlier because if I throw a neural
706.14,3.6,network at a machine at a or at a
708.36,3.18,cryptography problem and see if the
709.74,3.9,neural network can just like figure it
711.54,4.32,out so the neural networks like acting
713.64,4.439,as the adversary kind of
715.86,4.02,um I don't know really how that network
718.079,4.5,works so I don't really have a
719.88,3.959,mathematical proof in the sense of a
722.579,3.241,proof that I can like read and
723.839,4.381,understand for like why my scheme was
725.82,3.6,broken the network just kind of figured
728.22,4.2,it out
729.42,5.82,um but people do you know do try and do
732.42,4.979,this and in practice on real schemes
735.24,5.279,that are like running on systems this
737.399,5.401,can also help you find actually bugs so
740.519,3.781,if you have a bug in your scheme
742.8,3.36,um you know machine learning might be
744.3,5.12,able to pick up some statistical pattern
746.16,3.26,you wouldn't see by hand
751.079,5.221,and just to give you know a concrete
753.36,5.88,example of why this like matters
756.3,5.94,um here's um here's a kind of a visual
759.24,5.339,of the um Advanced encryption standard
762.24,5.339,which like you don't need to know how it
764.579,5.281,works I just want you to think that um
767.579,4.621,that it's basically like a really really
769.86,4.26,good and complicated Cipher for
772.2,4.92,substituting letters with other letters
774.12,5.159,it's like you know the Enigma machine
777.12,5.159,this is like the mathematically secure
779.279,4.8,digma machine this one actually works
782.279,3.661,um and so
784.079,5.161,AES
785.94,5.82,um is what is called a block Cipher and
789.24,3.599,block ciphers although we have very good
791.76,3.9,reason
792.839,4.5,um to believe are like very secure and
795.66,3.299,even secure against like quantum
797.339,4.44,computers
798.959,5.641,um we don't actually have proof uh we
801.779,5.941,don't really have explicit proofs for
804.6,4.62,why these ciphers um are so secure we
807.72,4.14,think that it's because they model
809.22,6.059,random like basically just a totally
811.86,6.419,random function well but there is not a
815.279,4.641,proof for this and so you might think
818.279,4.201,you know
819.92,5.74,maybe if there is something like
822.48,5.82,statistically significant in like across
825.66,5.28,AES or maybe a specific implementation
828.3,3.979,of AES that maybe has a bug in it so it
830.94,3.66,doesn't work the way it's supposed to
832.279,4.3,you could throw some like machine
834.6,3.66,learning at it and see if it picks up
836.579,3.361,any patterns
838.26,4.019,um and if it does pick up any patterns
839.94,4.86,it can help you like bug fix if it's an
842.279,5.401,implementation or it could show that
844.8,6.36,there's some underlying problem in AES
847.68,4.74,that we don't know about and this you
851.16,3.419,know if someone actually found this with
852.42,5.28,AES it would be like Earth shattering
854.579,6.0,because you use AES hundreds of times a
857.7,5.04,day you're using AES right now this
860.579,3.721,video this video feed that you're
862.74,4.2,looking at
864.3,5.339,um I think is encrypted with AES I don't
866.94,4.62,know if Zoom has fully uh Zoom was in
869.639,3.241,the process of encrypting video feeds I
871.56,2.219,don't know if they've finished so I
872.88,3.3,don't know if it's actually running
873.779,4.981,right now but like any time you use an
876.18,5.279,encrypted video chat or if you ever go
878.76,5.06,to like the http PS version of a site
881.459,4.74,where the S stands for secure
883.82,3.94,all of that is being done with this
886.199,3.781,encryption standard
887.76,3.54,um so it would be it would be like quite
889.98,2.94,shocking
891.3,4.26,um if it if it ever ended up like being
892.92,6.8,broken or very reassuring if we actually
895.56,4.16,got you know a proof out of it
901.139,5.76,on the other hand we can also think
903.959,5.701,about uh instead of using ml to like
906.899,5.341,either attack or build cryptography we
909.66,6.78,can think about also how cryptography
912.24,6.719,can help us do ml uh better so machine
916.44,4.56,learning often uses sensitive data as I
918.959,4.081,said like maybe Hospital data and you
921.0,3.8,got to protect it and if anyone is
923.04,4.56,interested in this topic more generally
924.8,6.46,the keywords you want to search for is
927.6,6.06,privacy preserving machine learning
931.26,4.379,and so you know why do we even need to
933.66,3.539,think about this
935.639,2.161,um you know
937.199,1.921,um
937.8,4.62,so like why do we even need to think
939.12,5.64,about this well if you have
942.42,4.979,um say like Census Data
944.76,5.519,um you and you want to like do some
947.399,4.44,machine learning on the Census Data
950.279,2.821,um you don't want to lose any of the
951.839,3.481,senses you don't want to like
953.1,4.679,accidentally leak information about like
955.32,5.16,a real person's census right like a
957.779,4.74,census record in the U.S census has tons
960.48,3.479,of personal information about you right
962.519,4.201,it has your name it has your social
963.959,5.281,security number it has like
966.72,3.96,um your family that lives with you
969.24,4.44,um it has tons and tons of information
970.68,4.38,in it and you don't want any any of that
973.68,5.58,to leak and I have just this little
975.06,5.82,picture of um of a census record and so
979.26,4.8,you know
980.88,4.98,the easiest thing we could maybe do is
984.06,3.66,basically jiggle so I just have this
985.86,3.3,picture of jello here
987.72,3.359,um because I don't really have a good
989.16,4.5,visual representation of what we're of
991.079,3.901,what this is doing besides like thinking
993.66,3.179,of like you know
994.98,5.159,making the data like wiggle a little bit
996.839,5.701,but you know you can think about it uh
1000.139,4.741,about this as like if I changed every
1002.54,4.919,single piece of data just a little bit
1004.88,5.16,so like I changed everyone's names just
1007.459,4.32,a little bit I changed everyone's like
1010.04,4.32,um addresses a little bit I changed
1011.779,5.641,everyone's like I changed all the data
1014.36,6.0,just a little bit and on the individual
1017.42,5.82,level I can't I can't easily leak
1020.36,5.16,anyone's uh I I can't leak anyone's
1023.24,4.62,information anymore necessarily so like
1025.52,4.919,if you looked at one row in the database
1027.86,4.62,that like this maybe this is training
1030.439,4.801,data was stored in
1032.48,5.339,um I can't I can't identify who that
1035.24,5.339,belonged to eventually because I I
1037.819,5.581,basically randomized the data a little
1040.579,5.701,bit and I say a little bit because if
1043.4,5.039,you're very careful you can make it to
1046.28,6.0,where the machine learning you would do
1048.439,6.24,on the original data still works on this
1052.28,4.5,like jiggled data so even though all the
1054.679,5.101,data has been changed just a little bit
1056.78,5.58,you can still compute or you can still
1059.78,6.06,do machine learning and learn useful
1062.36,5.52,things about the entire data set and
1065.84,4.4,those those things you might learn about
1067.88,6.78,the entire data set and the aggregate
1070.24,6.4,will be still very accurate to how they
1074.66,4.32,would have been if I hadn't like jiggled
1076.64,4.32,any of the data so this is called
1078.98,4.26,differential privacy and it's like a
1080.96,5.579,huge research topic it is actually being
1083.24,4.92,used in the U.S census now so like you
1086.539,4.081,can find there were Congressional
1088.16,4.74,hearings about exactly what mathematical
1090.62,4.32,parameters and how to pick them and you
1092.9,3.84,know guys from the Census Bureau and
1094.94,3.479,we're having to like explain to Senators
1096.74,3.84,why it mattered
1098.419,5.521,um which there were some pretty funny
1100.58,6.18,interactions there but you know this is
1103.94,5.34,something simple you can do and I say
1106.76,5.4,simple in reality I just mean not
1109.28,6.3,cryptographic it's not cryptography but
1112.16,6.32,it's um but it's not it's not not enough
1115.58,6.599,so even though we can do this
1118.48,6.34,this differential privacy and like
1122.179,4.261,compute some things with a data set it
1124.82,3.9,doesn't actually solve a lot of like
1126.44,6.42,hard problems
1128.72,6.9,um that we might care about so you know
1132.86,4.439,when I do you know when I like jiggle
1135.62,4.679,all the data a little bit I add noise
1137.299,5.341,and I get this new secure data set
1140.299,5.221,um this data set is now locked I can't
1142.64,3.96,like I can't change any of the data I
1145.52,3.48,can't figure out if there were
1146.6,3.84,duplicates I can't clean it so like a
1149.0,3.12,big part of machine learning is like
1150.44,3.599,making sure your data is in a
1152.12,4.5,presentable fashion for like doing the
1154.039,4.801,machine learning once you've done this
1156.62,5.28,you cannot go back and clean it the
1158.84,4.68,whole data is has been randomized to a
1161.9,3.24,point that like you can't identify
1163.52,4.08,anything
1165.14,4.44,um properly so like if I delete you know
1167.6,4.439,if I delete a row of a spreadsheet after
1169.58,4.44,I've like you know randomized it I have
1172.039,4.02,no idea if what I deleted was a
1174.02,3.98,duplicate or not I don't know like who
1176.059,5.161,it belonged to and I'm not supposed to
1178.0,6.52,but you know you could imagine scenarios
1181.22,6.18,where you would want to like do this
1184.52,6.06,um like cleaning process so there's two
1187.4,5.22,things we can do and I know I am running
1190.58,3.599,close um close on time so I'm going to
1192.62,4.5,wrap it up soon
1194.179,5.941,um but you know we have what's called
1197.12,4.799,secure multi-party computation and not
1200.12,5.46,going to explain how that works but the
1201.919,5.76,idea is that you can take something you
1205.58,4.32,can take two things
1207.679,5.101,um you know you can take some data you
1209.9,5.639,can compute something about it
1212.78,5.519,um that is like supposed to be that is
1215.539,6.861,supposed to be private and you will get
1218.299,7.201,an answer back but you did not have to
1222.4,5.26,make the entire data set like you didn't
1225.5,4.74,have to jiggle all the data this time so
1227.66,5.28,like say we have like this scientist uh
1230.24,4.14,Ria I think I got this um picture from a
1232.94,2.76,National Institute of Standards and
1234.38,3.659,Technology
1235.7,4.38,um article and say like Ria here wants
1238.039,4.201,to compute something about you know
1240.08,4.74,these two different hospital databases
1242.24,5.1,uh but you know she doesn't want to like
1244.82,4.44,destroy the data so she can like modify
1247.34,3.719,it if she needs to you can put
1249.26,4.86,multi-party computation in the middle
1251.059,6.12,and you are allowed to do that
1254.12,6.12,um another thing you might want to do is
1257.179,6.0,you could like compute uh uh do some
1260.24,5.7,data does some data have duplicates so
1263.179,4.38,is some data like replicated in two
1265.94,2.82,different like training sets that are
1267.559,3.24,maybe really sensitive and you don't
1268.76,3.48,want to leak anything about them and you
1270.799,3.421,can do that with a cryptographic
1272.24,4.26,technique called private intersection or
1274.22,4.8,private set intersection this was used
1276.5,4.62,by Apple and their csam system actually
1279.02,3.72,which they almost put on your phones but
1281.12,3.54,there were some issues with it and a lot
1282.74,4.26,of backlash and they canceled the
1284.66,4.019,project at the last minute but that's
1287.0,4.799,just an example of like you know it
1288.679,5.401,being present and you know in real life
1291.799,3.721,and the system it was being used for was
1294.08,3.719,a machine Learning System so it's like
1295.52,5.34,extra extra relevant
1297.799,5.281,um and then lastly I will say you know
1300.86,3.9,um even these are like you know
1303.08,4.74,relatively simple things we want to do
1304.76,4.98,like Sub sub like out like database
1307.82,3.78,entries check for duplicates and stuff
1309.74,4.86,you could imagine you want to do
1311.6,5.76,something more complicated and for that
1314.6,4.199,we have this very very powerful thing uh
1317.36,3.36,called fully homomorphic encryption
1318.799,3.961,which was discovered
1320.72,4.56,um formally by this guy named Craig
1322.76,4.5,Gentry about 11 years ago
1325.28,3.6,um he's an inspiration to me because he
1327.26,3.539,did not he was a lawyer and then was
1328.88,5.34,like I want to do math so then he got a
1330.799,5.461,PhD in uh in computer science sat in a
1334.22,2.88,room for like six years and figured this
1336.26,3.18,out
1337.1,4.86,um at the age of like 43
1339.44,4.02,um so he's a cool dude uh it's never too
1341.96,2.82,late to like figure out something you
1343.46,3.3,want to do
1344.78,4.98,um and so fully homomorphic encryption
1346.76,5.58,is like you know it's the king in some
1349.76,5.46,sense of cryptography it lets us just
1352.34,5.1,give it lets us encrypt data give it to
1355.22,4.74,someone else and they can do arbitrary
1357.44,4.619,computation they could do arbitrary say
1359.96,3.9,machine learning on the encrypted data
1362.059,3.721,and they can give us the results back
1363.86,5.28,and they have no idea what the results
1365.78,5.22,are but we do we can decrypt it and so
1369.14,3.72,this is super cool
1371.0,3.6,um the only thing I want you to
1372.86,4.08,understand in terms of how it works is
1374.6,4.199,you can think of it as taking like one
1376.94,5.16,addition or multiplication for numbers
1378.799,5.461,that you knew about and transforming it
1382.1,4.559,into like hundreds of multiplications or
1384.26,4.919,hundreds of additions that basically
1386.659,5.461,hide what the original numbers were it's
1389.179,5.221,like super super simple overview of how
1392.12,4.559,it works and for how we could use that
1394.4,3.899,in machine learning it's basically you
1396.679,4.74,know throwing the kitchen sink at the
1398.299,5.221,problem so like say I want to like you
1401.419,5.401,know do some machine learning on really
1403.52,5.7,sensitive data I could just encrypt it I
1406.82,4.08,could then do the machine learning and
1409.22,4.14,you know the people doing the machine
1410.9,5.22,learning or like the model itself has no
1413.36,4.98,idea what the real data was and but the
1416.12,3.299,machine learning will work basically so
1418.34,3.42,even though they don't know what it is
1419.419,4.861,it will work and give useful answers and
1421.76,4.86,only you who has the you know who has
1424.28,4.32,the keys to decrypt everything will get
1426.62,4.08,useful stuff back
1428.6,4.8,um and so I think I'm going to end it
1430.7,5.339,there there's many more like you know
1433.4,3.96,uses of cryptography and ml that I'm
1436.039,2.941,sure hasn't even been thought of it's
1437.36,3.059,there's constant Publications but I'm
1438.98,4.52,going to stop there because I think I'm
1440.419,3.081,I'm running on time
