0.829,4.631,hello dr. Ron Eaglin I want to talk to
3.389,5.521,you about today is programming for the
5.46,5.28,internet so we'll get started okay first
8.91,3.39,slide is looking at what we're going to
10.74,2.91,cover here so we're going to you know
12.3,3.899,what we're going to talk about is oh you
13.65,3.57,know how the internet works and why but
16.199,2.761,it's important to know how the internet
17.22,3.719,works and really the basics of the
18.96,5.909,internet how your change to programming
20.939,6.031,because it really shapes the way that we
24.869,4.021,have to program when we're using the
26.97,4.709,internet so we're looking a little bit
28.89,5.73,at client-side server-side and then some
31.679,5.31,kind of neat things like Ajax and Java
34.62,5.88,and mobile devices and utility computing
36.989,5.281,in the cloud a lot more to Internet
40.5,3.36,programming I'm not going to cover
42.27,3.719,everything but I'm going to give you big
43.86,3.539,over big basic overview of some of the
45.989,4.111,stuff with a little bit of detail so you
47.399,4.8,can understand kind of how it looks when
50.1,3.029,you get down into the works of it so
52.199,2.851,first we got to understand a little
53.129,3.391,about the internet when you're
55.05,3.09,programming for the internet you're
56.52,4.62,really looking at this thing that stands
58.14,4.469,between the client and the server and
61.14,3.989,what we mean you guys kind understand
62.609,5.281,what client and server is okay client is
65.129,4.621,most the time you you go the Internet
67.89,5.31,through a browser through something and
69.75,5.549,you want information now you don't stand
73.2,3.809,around and listen for somebody to ask
75.299,3.421,you for information from the internet
77.009,3.301,that's not what you're doing as a client
78.72,3.21,but there are those things out there
80.31,3.629,that do that they just sit there and
81.93,5.189,wait for requests and those are called
83.939,4.5,servers client through the internet
87.119,3.901,makes a request to the server and a
88.439,5.22,server responds so what we're talking
91.02,4.139,about is concept of a synchronous not
93.659,3.871,synchronous if I'm having a discussion
95.159,5.28,with you it's synchronous we're talking
97.53,6.119,back and forth asynchronous means I send
100.439,6.091,something up there and then I wait ok
103.649,5.161,well what's happening here is you've got
106.53,3.93,this server there that's just listening
108.81,2.79,for requests ok it's got something
110.46,3.869,actually called a listener
111.6,4.92,hey is a request coming in I got a
114.329,6.301,request and then it figures out what to
116.52,6.3,do and it responds to that so it
120.63,4.349,responds to the request and it sends
122.82,4.5,something back but you know what when
124.979,4.381,you have this kind of thing going on it
127.32,3.719,creates challenges for the way that you
129.36,3.08,program because if you're writing a
131.039,3.201,computer program and
132.44,3.63,sitting on top of a computer and you
134.24,3.03,call a function this function is going
136.07,2.25,to come back you don't worry about
137.27,3.06,whether it's going to come back you know
138.32,3.39,if the computer crashes in the middle of
140.33,2.67,the function well maybe you're gonna
141.71,3.96,have a problem there and you have some
143.0,4.38,error handling to deal with it but in
145.67,3.36,the world of the Internet you can send
147.38,3.69,requests up there to some server and
149.03,3.3,nothing happens the server just ignores
151.07,3.9,you and says I'm not going to give
152.33,3.84,anything back so we got ways that we got
154.97,3.0,to deal with that so you have to have
156.17,3.84,some level of fault tolerance and it
157.97,5.22,creates strategies for dealing with
160.01,5.52,these so let's look at some of this so
163.19,4.2,let's first look at the send everything
165.53,3.15,approach and I know some people are
167.39,3.06,going to take exception the fact that I
168.68,3.21,said that Java is a compiled language
170.45,3.75,because you say it's an interpreted
171.89,4.26,language well you know what in some
174.2,3.33,cases it is in some cases it isn't but
176.15,3.66,if you're actually having a pre compiled
177.53,3.66,language I still consider it a compiled
179.81,3.93,language but you have these things
181.19,4.14,called interpreted languages JavaScript
183.74,2.94,being probably the biggest example of an
185.33,3.09,interpreted language and there's other
186.68,4.14,ones but you know that's kind of deal
188.42,5.46,with the biggies here so in JavaScript
190.82,6.18,I send the code to the client okay
193.88,4.68,server says give me this page and the
197.0,3.29,page has a lot of cool things that it
198.56,5.16,wants to do and it has it done in code
200.29,5.05,well you can write JavaScript code that
203.72,3.63,sends it right back over to the client
205.34,3.869,and in this case that the client is a
207.35,3.96,web browser it's going to look at that
209.209,5.311,JavaScript and it's going to say oh I
211.31,5.85,have code I need to execute it's written
214.52,4.74,as text I have to interpret it and do
217.16,3.81,what it says and that's good old
219.26,4.229,JavaScript and learning JavaScript has
220.97,3.87,lots of capabilities and if you want to
223.489,2.97,learn about JavaScript yes we teach
224.84,4.38,classes in JavaScript to teach you to do
226.459,4.261,a lot of things but this is the approach
229.22,3.6,where you send everything over to the
230.72,3.36,client the JavaScript goes to the client
232.82,3.57,if I want to look at your JavaScript I
234.08,5.1,can look at your JavaScript okay it's
236.39,4.349,that's it that's how it works now I have
239.18,4.32,other things that can be either compiled
240.739,4.861,or precompiled things like flash and
243.5,4.29,Java and Silverlight and other things
245.6,3.72,that have now in the case of many things
247.79,3.63,like flash let's talk about flash a
249.32,4.65,little bit you know much browsers just
251.42,3.87,don't automatically handle flash being
253.97,3.09,sent to them they have something that
255.29,4.29,sits inside the browser that says oh
257.06,5.04,it's flash code I know what to do with
259.58,5.97,flash code and it does all the stuff
262.1,5.67,that the flash tells it to do
265.55,4.109,okay it's still setting the stuff over
267.77,3.57,to the browser in most cases in case the
269.659,2.94,bras are still receiving the information
271.34,3.329,and having to do something with it
272.599,6.69,that's the good old send everything
274.669,8.101,approach now what's the downside of this
279.289,4.651,well first thing is you're sending
282.77,3.149,everything over to the browser
283.94,4.86,I mean browser doesn't necessarily need
285.919,5.34,everything so this can really slow stuff
288.8,3.69,down okay you really want to send to the
291.259,3.361,browser because it's coming through an
292.49,5.399,internet connection uh you wanna send
294.62,6.63,just what the browser needs okay well
297.889,6.301,what about some sort of interaction well
301.25,4.65,suppose I have I something I want to do
304.19,4.17,on my browser that requires a tremendous
305.9,5.25,amount of data to be looked at and
308.36,4.95,compiled okay well am I just going to
311.15,3.78,send all the data to the browser and
313.31,3.06,then work from it from there am I going
314.93,5.22,to actually try to send it just the data
316.37,5.699,that I need so what about the data if
320.15,3.359,you try to do with you know especially
322.069,2.85,when you have to wrangle down and do it
323.509,4.5,lots of data you know you want to get
324.919,4.86,that data and it that you need and you
328.009,3.541,really want to have the server deal with
329.779,4.051,a lot of that details of figuring out
331.55,4.83,this needs to go to you this needs to go
333.83,6.869,to the browser so what will we do about
336.38,5.64,this well let's get a way to to
340.699,5.25,communicate back and forth with the
342.02,6.03,server so anytime you request a pet a
345.949,3.451,webpage you send a request up to the
348.05,2.85,server and the server comes back and
349.4,2.79,says hey I got that file I'll send it to
350.9,3.629,you and it sends it to you and there it
352.19,4.02,goes but now you want to ask for more
354.529,4.531,detailed information you're actually an
356.21,4.829,ask for not just a page a file that's
359.06,4.05,sitting on the server but the server's
361.039,3.481,got to do something a little bit more
363.11,3.48,complex to put everything together
364.52,5.429,before it sends it to you and it's got
366.59,6.6,ways to do this I'm going to go with the
369.949,4.83,two Biggie's HTTP GET HTTP POST and
373.19,2.879,you've used both of them if you've ever
374.779,3.211,used the internet you've used them both
376.069,3.96,and really the difference between the
377.99,3.329,two is where's the information that
380.029,2.521,you're sending to the server not the
381.319,3.391,information coming back from the server
382.55,3.839,but the request that you're sending this
384.71,4.739,server where is that information that
386.389,5.221,really specifies what you want an HTTP
389.449,4.14,GET you use the URL of the request an
391.61,2.539,HTTP POST you use the body of the
393.589,3.42,request
394.149,4.671,the big difference being if you know
397.009,3.191,what to look for you can
398.82,4.29,read all the information you're asking
400.2,5.04,for in the HTTP GET in an HTTP POST it's
403.11,5.31,hidden from you so let's look at an HTTP
405.24,5.94,GET this is an actual web URL I can send
408.42,4.44,you this web URL and if you bring this
411.18,3.96,web URL upon your browser you're going
412.86,5.88,to get exactly the same thing that I get
415.14,5.58,if I do it here okay it's not that
418.74,3.75,there's some file that's got this big
420.72,4.08,massively long name with all this
422.49,5.07,gobbledygook in it what you're actually
424.8,7.68,doing is you're saying I'm going to send
427.56,8.55,some information to do google.com slash
432.48,6.12,search ok now if you look at this
436.11,4.59,there's a question mark right there that
438.6,3.93,question mark delineates everything on
440.7,3.96,this side is where I'm sending it and
442.53,4.26,everything on this side is what I'm
444.66,5.52,sending it so that the server can look
446.79,6.0,at all this stuff and it can say oh I
450.18,3.93,know what to do with this and really
452.79,8.64,what's happening here is it's saying you
454.11,9.09,know what site equals IMG HP ok the
461.43,3.96,server is going to go I got a key value
463.2,6.75,pair I've got a key site and I've got
465.39,6.36,some sort of value that's IMG HP so when
469.95,4.5,I'm looking for what I want to send back
471.75,4.23,I'm going to look for that key site and
474.45,3.54,the value and I'm going to figure out
475.98,5.55,what to do with it so you have a where
477.99,5.49,and you have a lot that you're sending
481.53,4.56,over and the what can get really long
483.48,4.98,can't be infinitely long okay because
486.09,5.04,get requests have some things about them
488.46,5.79,that are important like length
491.13,6.45,restrictions okay other thing is if
494.25,6.15,you're sending sensitive data okay to a
497.58,4.59,server probably not a good idea to pop
500.4,3.33,it into the get pop it into a get
502.17,3.84,request and do it that way because guess
503.73,4.38,what anybody can see the URL so sitting
506.01,4.17,up there at the top of the browser up in
508.11,3.84,the URL bar okay but there's some nice
510.18,4.799,things about it like you know it sits in
511.95,5.25,the browser history you can cache it it
514.979,4.081,gets bookmarked you can bookmark get
517.2,3.089,requests I can take that big old loan
519.06,3.57,request I have write that back there
520.289,4.191,that I just shows you I can bookmark it
522.63,5.61,and I can bring it up whenever I want to
524.48,5.17,okay so pretty much the guidelines the
528.24,3.85,other set of guidelines for using get
529.65,4.12,and casada guidelines for using post and
532.09,4.89,we like to follow those but let's talk a
533.77,5.25,little bit about post so he can't see
536.98,4.47,the dad in post what you see in the URL
539.02,4.05,bar just looks like the webpage but it's
541.45,5.19,still asking for stuff what happens is
543.07,5.82,the data from the post is sitting inside
546.64,3.69,of the actual document that you're
548.89,2.61,sending over so there's actually more
550.33,2.91,than your setting than just a URL
551.5,4.65,there's actually more stuff in that
553.24,5.37,packet that you send to the server than
556.15,3.96,just what's in that URL bar okay but
558.61,3.12,that gives you some limitations that go
560.11,4.32,with it too like you can't you can't
561.73,4.92,bookmark a post because there's nothing
564.43,5.22,in that URL when you save a bookmark
566.65,5.01,you're just saving the URL okay
569.65,4.17,well the information that you want to
571.66,3.96,send to the server is it in the URL so
573.82,3.45,therefore guess what you're not going to
575.62,3.45,be able to bookmark it if you do that
577.27,3.15,and yes and you send you know you click
579.07,2.73,on the bookmark it's just going to go
580.42,3.63,there and go I don't have the
581.8,4.38,information you actually need okay but
584.05,4.11,it says one nice thing about it no
586.18,3.18,restrictions on the data length and
588.16,3.75,actually not a lot of restrictions on
589.36,3.72,that type either so you know you've got
591.91,3.15,some pretty neat things that you can do
593.08,4.05,there okay you know it's security I can
595.06,3.15,take the post data and I can actually
597.13,2.79,encrypt it and send it over to the
598.21,2.879,server now of course that doesn't mean
599.92,4.56,that the server is going to have to be
601.089,4.171,able to decrypt that so not you know
604.48,2.73,can't be
605.26,3.57,if you can't decrypt it and don't send
607.21,3.51,an encrypted but if you need security
608.83,3.15,just but that encryption algorithm on
610.72,4.29,both sides and you're good to go
611.98,4.59,so let's look at this what actually is
615.01,3.72,happening now we've got we got some
616.57,4.95,background here what happens when you go
618.73,4.77,through this client that's you write web
621.52,3.51,browser whatever doesn't matter whether
623.5,3.33,you're on a mobile phone whether you
625.03,4.83,know it's the same thing you request to
626.83,4.35,pay age okay server sees that request
629.86,3.06,and says you know what I got to come up
631.18,3.24,with the response I send the response
632.92,4.11,back to the client client receives a
634.42,4.41,response okay client now says you know
637.03,3.21,what I looked at this this is a person
638.83,3.0,or it can actually be a piece of suffer
640.24,4.26,on the client that does that says ah
641.83,4.17,thank you I am going to give you a new
644.5,3.6,request it sends a request over to the
646.0,3.36,server and then it goes through the
648.1,3.33,server and the server receives in
649.36,4.65,response okay if you notice what's going
651.43,4.74,on here okay the big difference between
654.01,4.11,the client and the server servers up
656.17,5.55,here listening notice the communication
658.12,5.13,really goes to that server client
661.72,3.66,doesn't do anything unless the server's
663.25,2.399,received a request from that client okay
665.38,2.399,so
665.649,3.961,isn't pushing stuff to your browser okay
667.779,2.821,an action can push stuff your through
669.61,2.759,your browser if you're on a specific
670.6,3.33,page that allows for you to do that but
672.369,3.69,that's code that's sitting there that
673.93,3.599,makes that that makes that possible okay
676.059,4.71,you're not just going to open up your
677.529,5.071,browser and all sudden all the servers
680.769,3.93,go oh look he's got his browser up let's
682.6,4.649,start throwing stuff atom in how it
684.699,3.961,works okay your client isn't listening
687.249,4.95,for that type of thing unless you
688.66,6.0,actually send a request out so let's
692.199,4.95,talk about the Refresh Yuval use
694.66,7.32,browsers you do something you click and
697.149,6.72,the page refreshes okay now what about
701.98,4.199,that refresh every time you refresh a
703.869,4.2,page you send everything again it's all
706.179,4.26,going you can put requests up there and
708.069,3.96,the whole page refreshes you know a lot
710.439,3.87,of the times you don't need to refresh
712.029,4.53,the whole page you may need to refresh a
714.309,3.9,little piece of that page okay that
716.559,3.661,brings out a whole new paradigm and
718.209,5.011,actually dealing with web programming
720.22,4.95,okay suppose you send a request up and
723.22,4.289,you only need to refresh a small part of
725.17,5.279,the page let's just do that
727.509,4.44,let's not refresh the whole page let's
730.449,3.87,just refresh the little piece that you
731.949,3.99,need okay well how do you do that well
734.319,4.56,you got a technology for you to do that
735.939,4.471,called Ajax we have a nice pretty name
738.879,3.63,for it called asynchronous JavaScript
740.41,3.239,and XML okay well why because the
742.509,4.26,background technologies that make it
743.649,4.971,possible are JavaScript and XML okay so
746.769,3.99,it only refreshes a little piece now
748.62,4.329,let's take a little look at why this
750.759,3.961,might be important to you because if
752.949,3.091,you're a web programmer you don't want
754.72,2.789,to be clogging up the bandwidth here you
756.04,2.849,want to only send information through
757.509,2.911,the pipes that you need to send through
758.889,3.961,the pipes so let's take an example of
760.42,4.349,this okay this is a cascading drop-down
762.85,4.109,this is one of the Ajax examples from
764.769,4.44,the Microsoft web page and a cascading
766.959,6.151,drop-down let's say you know what you
769.209,7.531,could send all the mix of all the cars
773.11,5.76,to the client and all the models of all
776.74,4.62,the mix of all the cars to the clients
778.87,4.679,and then all the colors of all the
781.36,3.99,models of all the makes to the client so
783.549,4.53,you know what that's a lot of data I
785.35,5.279,don't want to do that what I want to do
788.079,5.31,is I want the user to select to make
790.629,5.341,okay and based on the make that he
793.389,4.981,selected I want the server send back and
795.97,3.19,put into a drop-down just the models
798.37,3.85,that go with that
799.16,5.19,specific make well Ajax lets me do that
802.22,3.059,but what am i doing when I do that this
804.35,3.45,is on a web page
805.279,5.161,I'm not refreshing the entire page I'm
807.8,4.5,only going to refresh that drop-down
810.44,3.689,that's it that's all I want I'm done
812.3,4.529,good finished okay
814.129,5.88,and once you select that model all I
816.829,6.81,want to see is what colors are available
820.009,8.461,for that make and model like C green so
823.639,7.2,that's that's Ajax in a nutshell now of
828.47,4.02,course it's not just dropdowns it's all
830.839,4.17,sorts of different things you can have a
832.49,6.57,web page but that's the guts and
835.009,6.151,understanding how it works so next
839.06,4.319,language Java not going spend a lot of
841.16,4.529,time with Java because Java is a lot of
843.379,3.781,things to a lot of people but what Java
845.689,3.871,allows you to do is have a full
847.16,5.88,programming capability embedded inside
849.56,7.259,of webpages and all other types of
853.04,4.589,devices its multi-platform it can work
856.819,2.671,on all over the place
857.629,3.33,well doesn't mean that a Java Java
859.49,3.48,program that you write for a browser is
860.959,3.99,going to work on a phone unless it maybe
862.97,3.57,it's on the phone browser but what means
864.949,4.021,it's one language you can do all those
866.54,3.599,types of things so job is that great
868.97,3.69,thing to try to be everything to
870.139,4.531,everybody well it kind of meets a lot of
872.66,3.599,that but in some places it doesn't do
874.67,3.0,all that it does have one thing that's
876.259,5.01,really nice about it which is the good
877.67,5.219,old just-in-time compilation hey you
881.269,3.151,read about Java you're going to hear
882.889,2.851,about just-in-time compilation which
884.42,3.06,gets me back to that first slide where
885.74,4.529,they say or some people say well no
887.48,5.31,child is an interpreted language no it's
890.269,4.92,not it is compiled it's just that it's
892.79,4.799,just in time compilation okay it does go
895.189,4.26,to a machine level code if you do that
897.589,4.201,you know machine level code is you can
899.449,3.901,send stuff over it's not the raw text of
901.79,5.46,the code and you can do stuff with it
903.35,5.789,and it can be very fast that way now
907.25,2.399,let's talk a little bit about mobile
909.139,1.62,devices
909.649,3.271,okay so anybody who's been doing
910.759,3.901,programming has got to deal with all the
912.92,3.63,different kinds of devices that you
914.66,3.63,might be dealing with well when you get
916.55,4.68,down into the guts of it mobile device
918.29,5.01,programming browser programming not
921.23,4.979,really different it's got clients it's
923.3,4.589,got servers it's got listeners okay that
926.209,2.73,part of the programming model doesn't
927.889,1.411,change so if you understand how that
928.939,2.611,works
929.3,3.65,guess what it still works okay however
931.55,3.29,the paradigm
932.95,3.81,turn on the way you use mobile
934.84,3.09,programming is totally different from
936.76,3.54,the way somebody who's stuck behind
937.93,4.77,machine gate behind a keyboard looking
940.3,5.34,at a screen you got thing held in your
942.7,6.6,hand it's small it moves around okay
945.64,6.0,got to do that so first if you're
949.3,3.24,thinking hey I have an app programmer
951.64,3.03,well that doesn't mean you're an
952.54,3.63,Internet programmer and that programmer
954.67,4.02,can be very simple I can have an app
956.17,5.43,that I download onto my mind to my phone
958.69,5.27,and it's a game and itself itself all
961.6,4.56,together everything is in that app
963.96,3.49,that's not an Internet program it was
966.16,2.43,just downloaded over the Internet
967.45,2.67,that doesn't make it an Internet program
968.59,2.85,internet programs communicate back and
970.12,2.97,forth with other machines over the
971.44,4.02,Internet a lot of apps are internet
973.09,3.39,programs and the big expectation for
975.46,3.69,most apps is that they do have that
976.48,4.32,ability to interact with the Internet so
979.15,3.6,what you're doing is you're taking
980.8,4.56,things that you did do it once in a
982.75,5.34,browser okay like interpreting code and
985.36,4.65,doing stuff with it and you're now doing
988.09,3.51,this on a very small very small device
990.01,4.38,so like my little very small device
991.6,4.62,right here my Galaxy s3 which you know
994.39,3.75,is a pretty awesome phone it's got a
996.22,3.87,really big screen but guess what that
998.14,3.72,big screen is still a lot tinier than
1000.09,3.87,one of the other devices that I can show
1001.86,4.29,you right here which is an iPad this is
1003.96,3.93,my iPad wait turn around this way so you
1006.15,3.99,can see it okay and I'm actually
1007.89,4.35,delivering to you this lecture on a
1010.14,3.96,computer so I've got all three of the
1012.24,4.71,primary devices sitting right in front
1014.1,5.19,of me different to the paradigm well
1016.95,5.22,yeah now are delivering to something
1019.29,4.95,small and you're delivering it typically
1022.17,3.75,not necessarily as a browser thing
1024.24,4.05,designed for a small mobile device but
1025.92,4.65,yet you can't have specific web pages
1028.29,3.6,designed for mobile devices but one
1030.57,4.62,likely you're probably programming apps
1031.89,5.76,and apps are specific they do specific
1035.19,4.98,tasks and that's their actual the nice
1037.65,3.929,utility of the concept of the app but
1040.17,3.36,the biggie and the paradigm is the fact
1041.579,4.051,that it's something that moves around
1043.53,4.26,you have mobility of user so you have a
1045.63,4.11,lot of freedom of what you can do also
1047.79,3.66,you have a lot of things that sit on top
1049.74,2.94,of this I'm going to go right here and
1051.45,4.05,I'm going to go ahead and pull this baby
1052.68,5.19,down here I have okay and you can see
1055.5,4.89,this I have Wi-Fi connection it's going
1057.87,6.45,to be all blurry but yeah I have Wi-Fi I
1060.39,5.58,have GPS I have all these Bluetooth I
1064.32,2.18,have all these other toys that I can
1065.97,3.11,play with
1066.5,4.35,that are part of this phone that a
1069.08,4.76,totally different operating system in
1070.85,5.82,this case Android that I'm working with
1073.84,4.51,the cloud well I understand the cloud
1076.67,3.72,you got to understand the concept of a
1078.35,5.01,web service and it's actually not that
1080.39,5.07,hard ok if you're a typical programmer
1083.36,3.81,you've wrote classes and classes may
1085.46,3.99,have methods but the basics of
1087.17,4.29,programming boils down to you know
1089.45,5.25,object-oriented program is a way to
1091.46,5.43,organize functions but we have object or
1094.7,4.17,ePro grams so we call the methods okay
1096.89,6.15,basically a piece of code does something
1098.87,6.48,ok and it sits on the machine and it's
1103.04,4.44,compiled and it works there and the
1105.35,4.89,machine calls the functions and you have
1107.48,5.4,function libraries and all this well the
1110.24,5.46,cloud takes all of that and exposes it
1112.88,5.88,to the web that's the basis of the cloud
1115.7,6.66,all those things that you can do right
1118.76,6.12,now with a machine become exposed to the
1122.36,3.39,entire world at large now of course that
1124.88,1.97,doesn't mean you're just going to go
1125.75,3.78,ahead and expose all your functions
1126.85,4.75,you're going to have some level security
1129.53,4.38,goes there but now here you've got these
1131.6,3.87,clients or servers because servers call
1133.91,3.06,the functions on other servers all the
1135.47,2.82,time and you've got some sort of
1136.97,2.49,interface that makes them which we call
1138.29,2.31,the server interface that makes them
1139.46,3.6,available to the rest of the world and
1140.6,4.05,we call that stuff web services and we
1143.06,3.69,put all those web services together and
1144.65,3.81,we have the cloud and the cloud allows
1146.75,3.48,us to have something new called utility
1148.46,4.2,computing I can pay for just the
1150.23,3.69,services I want I don't have to buy a
1152.66,4.08,whole bunch of stuff that I'm not going
1153.92,4.59,to use I can have a lot this so here's
1156.74,3.36,how this looks to the real world as
1158.51,3.99,you're doing this here's you the client
1160.1,4.98,kr maybe over here you're the programmer
1162.5,5.76,but say to the client and you go to the
1165.08,4.59,cloud to get stuff and what you know
1168.26,3.66,about what most people know about it is
1169.67,3.84,a lot of stuff happens here well that's
1171.92,3.78,all that stuff that happens in the cloud
1173.51,3.66,it's all happening right out there in
1175.7,4.32,the cloud and you don't really worry
1177.17,4.77,about what it is happening except if
1180.02,3.93,you're a cloud programmer and then you
1181.94,3.18,do ok but if we're going to be a cloud
1183.95,2.31,programmer you're going to take a cloud
1185.12,2.46,programming classes you're going to
1186.26,3.41,learn all about cloud programming and
1187.58,5.52,you're going to deal with a lot of stuff
1189.67,4.99,so what kind of cloud services do you
1193.1,3.72,have here well one of the things can
1194.66,3.63,happen is hosting the software d2l which
1196.82,3.239,is used at Daytona State College it's
1198.29,6.479,actually a hosted software the server
1200.059,6.42,managed d2l okay they're not actually on
1204.769,4.47,the campus they're actually I think
1206.479,4.65,they're in Canada so you know that's an
1209.239,3.99,external hosting but it's a piece of
1211.129,4.321,software that we use you can store files
1213.229,4.02,that it documents host meetings you can
1215.45,4.25,actually beautiful operating system you
1217.249,4.56,can manage businesses accounting okay
1219.7,5.589,essentially anything that you could do
1221.809,5.46,on a computer or anything you can do on
1225.289,5.13,a mobile device or anything you do on a
1227.269,6.03,tablet can all be cloud services okay
1230.419,4.38,can be done the cloud okay you still
1233.299,2.43,need some sort of device to get the
1234.799,2.25,stuff back on
1235.729,3.03,well list right now you do and we don't
1237.049,3.81,going directly to people's brains but
1238.759,4.77,who knows what's coming up later but
1240.859,4.68,it's all right there I mean it's all
1243.529,4.681,available and actually right now you'll
1245.539,4.62,see most of stuff is now moving to the
1248.21,5.959,cloud and you could hear about migrating
1250.159,6.48,new cloud but cloud is a great thing so
1254.169,5.08,some of the languages of technology this
1256.639,4.23,is just okay I was going to do one slide
1259.249,2.821,I can do 10 slides but I'm just going to
1260.869,2.73,say what are the technologies that you
1262.07,3.87,will probably learn if you're dealing
1263.599,4.231,with this I'm going to learn some
1265.94,3.0,databases I just listed a few of them
1267.83,2.909,you're going to probably learn some
1268.94,3.719,languages these are all languages that
1270.739,3.36,are very much tied specifically to
1272.659,3.45,things that we do over the net
1274.099,5.101,the internet and Internet programming um
1276.109,6.42,no I listed PHP don't say what about
1279.2,5.639,Python what about Ruby on Rails ah yeah
1282.529,4.5,I know they're there great awesome good
1284.839,5.16,okay just listing some of them
1287.029,5.19,JavaScript okay there's no one java.net
1289.999,3.78,entire platform that's you know really
1292.219,3.241,built for how to do so for the net I
1293.779,3.03,octave program and c-sharp I got a whole
1295.46,2.61,bunch of stuff written in VB okay
1296.809,2.7,there's languages that go behind that
1298.07,3.359,you can write that stuff in multiple
1299.509,4.29,languages okay working with databases
1301.429,3.24,you have T sequel PL sequel two examples
1303.799,2.67,of that if you want to actually
1304.669,3.651,interface with databases that's some of
1306.469,5.93,the stuff that you would learn okay
1308.32,7.569,there's a lot really there really yes
1312.399,5.291,put it all together how this all goes
1315.889,3.54,together well we looked at how the
1317.69,4.289,internet works and why we care well if
1319.429,4.47,you're dealing with this kind of concept
1321.979,4.29,of clients and servers and listeners and
1323.899,4.47,requests and responses it's a totally
1326.269,3.99,different architecture really than what
1328.369,3.951,you have in programming and the fact
1330.259,3.92,that it's now can be asynchronous
1332.32,3.63,and you may not get a request not that
1334.179,4.441,tremendously different though than how
1335.95,4.5,regular old programming works we looked
1338.62,3.659,at client and server based programming
1340.45,3.089,stuff that client pace and everything go
1342.279,3.15,to the client let them worry about it
1343.539,3.541,server based program let's talk let's go
1345.429,3.271,back and forth Ajax
1347.08,3.959,let's talk only about the things we want
1348.7,3.839,to talk about Java hey we're going to
1351.039,3.661,solve all the problems of the entire
1352.539,3.6,world with one language mobile devices
1354.7,2.88,oh gosh now they're actually walking
1356.139,3.721,around with computers in their hands and
1357.58,6.679,the cloud hey everything is no longer on
1359.86,7.14,a computer this is state right now okay
1364.259,6.64,2013 this is all going to change in five
1367.0,5.7,years okay if you want to be a internet
1370.899,3.721,developer web programmer that type of
1372.7,4.01,thing first thing you got to do is you
1374.62,3.99,go like learning because guess what
1376.71,4.329,everything that you learn now is going
1378.61,3.99,to migrate it to the new stuff okay most
1381.039,3.0,of the time it's awesome because you get
1382.6,3.09,all these new capabilities and new
1384.039,4.711,markets and new things that you can do
1385.69,6.569,it's a very rewarding type of field to
1388.75,5.759,work into but it also changes a lot and
1392.259,4.62,you got me when those guys that likes
1394.509,4.441,programming likes learning likes new
1396.879,5.9,paradigms if every time something
1398.95,6.87,changes you don't start grumbling okay
1402.779,4.36,go into some other field if you do like
1405.82,4.469,learning you like programming you like
1407.139,5.701,the new stuff this is it you will never
1410.289,4.35,get bored about having to learn new
