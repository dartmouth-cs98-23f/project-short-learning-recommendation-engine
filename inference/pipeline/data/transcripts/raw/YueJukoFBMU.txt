0.03,4.979,let's assume sour promises to give Matt
2.7,4.59,$100 if he runs a mile in less than
5.009,4.531,seven minutes in this case everything
7.29,3.99,depends on that he can train until he
9.54,4.74,consistently succeeds and when he's
11.28,5.88,ready he can show Sara and give his $100
14.28,5.28,game theory doesn't study situations
17.16,3.9,like this one instead it studies
19.56,3.78,situations involving more than one
21.06,4.92,participant and in which not everything
23.34,4.679,depends on one person for example in the
25.98,3.869,game of chess the other players moves
28.019,3.961,continuously influence your strategy
29.849,4.471,that would be one example of a situation
31.98,4.349,studied by game theory but don't make
34.32,4.11,the mistake of assuming only actual
36.329,4.351,games are studied game theory is also
38.43,4.02,used to for example analyze situations
40.68,4.05,in which multiple companies are
42.45,4.109,competing against one another just like
44.73,3.899,in a game of chess the actions of one
46.559,4.531,company are influenced by the actions of
48.629,4.381,the other participants for example if a
51.09,3.809,competitor lowers the price the other
53.01,4.59,companies might be forced to do the same
54.899,4.98,as you can see game theory basically
57.6,4.59,analyzes the behavior of two or more
59.879,4.801,participants in situations involving
62.19,4.41,rewards or punishments the rules of the
64.68,3.9,so-called game are known by everyone and
66.6,4.14,it is assumed that all players are
68.58,3.899,rational now of course
70.74,3.72,game theory will never be able to
72.479,5.131,predict human behavior with 100%
74.46,5.31,accuracy in one situation or another you
77.61,4.829,might very well do the exact opposite of
79.77,4.95,what game theory suggests but still it
82.439,5.301,offers some truly fascinating human
84.72,3.02,behavior insight
