5.071,0.901,"In this video,"
6.039,1.968,"we're gonna look
at how predictive modeling"
8.074,1.702,"can be used
in an educational setting."
9.843,2.435,"And more specifically
we're gonna look at an example"
12.345,1.802,"of how we can use
predictive modeling"
14.214,2.636,"to detect students
who game the system."
18.985,1.802,"So, this video
is gonna just start"
20.854,2.002,"with a brief introduction
of predictive modeling"
22.922,1.936,"and the example
of gaming the system."
24.924,3.003,"So predictive modeling,
what is it?"
27.994,2.102,"It's a category
of machine learning"
30.163,2.035,"which is a field
in computer science."
32.265,2.936,"Uh, where we study how the
computers can learn from data."
35.268,2.836,"So more specifically, uh,"
38.171,2.636,"predictive modeling is a type
of supervised learning"
40.874,3.403,"which means that we know what
we want the computer to learn,"
44.344,1.968,"and what we do
is we give it example"
46.379,1.568,of what we want to learn
48.014,2.803,"and we let the computer
discover general rules"
50.884,2.669,"about when the example
is or is not"
53.62,2.836,"an ex-uh, what we-an example
of what we want it to learn."
56.523,2.235,"So what predictive
modeling-what we're gonna do"
58.825,1.868,"is we're gonna
try to develop models"
60.76,2.936,"that can infer
one specific aspect of the data"
63.763,2.036,"which we call
the predicted variables."
65.865,2.67,"And this prediction
can be about future event,"
68.601,2.97,"or they can be about events
that are happening at the moment"
71.638,2.602,"but that are unknown
values in our data."
74.307,3.637,"And so, just to give
a little bit of vocabulary."
78.011,2.836,"When we talk
about predictive modeling, uh,"
80.914,2.068,w-the predicted variable
83.049,2.136,"we also sometimes
call it the label."
85.251,1.869,"And the predictors
that are gonna be used"
87.187,3.37,"to predict that variable,
we also sometimes call features."
90.623,2.303,"So I'm gonna be using
those terms in this video."
92.992,3.07,"So there are
two main categories"
96.129,1.368,of predictive modeling
97.564,1.434,"that we're gonna
be talking about today."
99.065,1.568,"The first one is regression,"
100.7,2.035,and the second one classifications.
102.802,2.269,"The idea behind
those two types of analysis"
105.138,1.068,is very similar.
106.272,1.702,"Their main difference
is gonna be"
108.041,2.669,"in the nature of the variable
we're trying to predict."
110.777,2.769,"So, for regressions
we're gonna look"
113.613,3.57,"at predicting variables that
are numerical and continuous."
117.25,2.269,"Whereas for classification,
we're gonna look"
119.586,3.036,"at predicting variables
that are categorical."
122.689,2.402,"So for example, for regression,"
125.158,2.202,"uh, something
that we might be interested in"
127.427,3.437,"in the educational context,
is to try to predict"
130.93,1.402,how long is it gonna take
132.398,1.435,"for a student
to solve a problem."
133.9,3.437,"Or what is gonna be the score
of the student"
137.403,1.235,on the future test?
138.705,2.169,Or how many weeks is a student
140.94,2.236,"gonna stay engaged
in an online course?"
143.243,4.571,"Um, on the hand when we're
doing classification analysis,"
147.881,3.837,"uh, we're gonna try to predict
a categorical labels."
151.784,2.937,"So for example, will the
student complete the course?"
154.787,1.135,"So, we're not trying to predict"
155.989,1.568,"what the grade of the student
is gonna be,"
157.624,1.101,"we're just trying to predict,"
158.791,3.237,is the student gonna complete- yes or no?
162.095,1.668,"Uh, the same thing
if we look at"
163.83,4.371,will the student get the next answer right to this problem.
169.602,2.336,"So, in this video
we're gonna illustrate"
172.005,2.335,"the process of building
a predictive model"
174.407,3.904,"using an example of when
student games the system,"
178.378,1.735,"which is
a classification problem."
181.414,2.402,"So what exactly is
a student gaming the system?"
183.883,2.136,"Well, it's a type
of disengaged behavior"
186.085,3.003,"in which the student
try to solve problems"
189.155,2.603,"without actually
having to learn anything"
191.824,3.437,"by abusing the support
that the software gives you."
195.328,1.001,"So for example,"
196.396,2.502,trying to abuse the hints provided by the system
198.965,2.769,"or trying to systematically
try to guess the answer."
203.102,2.536,"And more specifically,
we're gonna look at the problem"
205.705,2.636,"of students who game
intelligent tutoring system."
208.408,2.102,"And what intelligent
tutoring system is,"
210.577,2.936,"it's a-a
problem solving environments"
213.58,3.436,where the problem is broken down into smaller steps.
217.083,1.468,"And in order to solve
the problem,"
218.618,3.403,"the student has to solve
each of those individual steps."
222.088,2.236,"And usually
that kind of environment,"
224.39,1.368,"intelligent tutors,"
225.825,1.869,"they will provide support
to the student"
227.76,1.869,in the form of next step hints
229.696,2.035,"about what the student
should be doing next."
231.798,3.57,"And also, um, feedback
on each step"
235.435,2.502,"to say if the step
was correct or incorrect."
238.004,2.769,"And the reason why
we're interested in studying"
240.84,2.035,"gaming the system
in those environment"
242.942,3.404,"is that it's been linked
to poor learning outcomes"
246.412,3.204,"and poorer long-term
academics success."
249.682,2.87,"So, as I said earlier,"
252.619,3.036,"gaming the system
is a classification problem."
255.722,2.502,"In this problem,
what we're gonna be predicting"
258.291,2.636,"is a categorical label
which is"
260.994,1.868,is the student gaming the system
262.929,2.436,"or is the student
not gaming the system."
265.431,2.603,"So, if we want to build
this model,"
268.101,1.835,the first thing we need to do
270.003,1.334,is we need to get example
271.404,2.469,"of what gaming behavior
look like."
273.94,2.536,"So it means we need
to collect labels."
276.542,1.735,"And so there are
many different ways"
278.344,1.535,to collect labels depending on
279.946,2.769,"what type of lavel-label
you are looking for."
282.782,3.003,"Some of them might come from
the learning environment itself."
285.852,2.769,"So, if you're looking at,
uh, in software performance"
288.688,3.904,the-did the student just manage to complete to problem or not.
292.659,1.901,"Uh, it could be school records"
294.627,1.869,"if you want to look
at grades of the students."
296.562,1.769,"Uh, it could be test data."
298.398,2.736,"Uh, but it cannot-but
sometimes we also wanna"
301.2,1.969,"predict things that are not
in the learning environment."
303.236,2.269,"And then in that cases,"
305.571,3.404,"then we will have to go
and collect additional data."
309.042,2.469,"And this can be achieved
using survey,"
311.577,3.737,"field observations,
a video/ audio/ text coding,"
315.381,1.535,"there's many different
ways to do it."
318.151,2.235,"In the context
of gaming the system,"
320.453,3.136,"well, we don't know when students are gaming the system."
323.656,1.902,"The learning environment
does not provide us"
325.625,1.568,with information about that.
327.26,1.234,"The learning environment
does not know"
328.561,2.236,"whether the student
is gaming the system or not."
330.863,1.202,"Uh, and if it did,"
332.131,2.403,"then we would not
need to create a model of it."
334.6,2.403,"Uh, so we need
additional data collection."
337.07,2.736,"And one way to do that
is to collect data"
339.872,2.269,"using something
we call text replays."
342.208,5.005,"So text replays, what they are is a vis-textual representation"
347.28,1.968,of the actions that the students
349.315,1.802,"are doing
in the learning environment."
351.184,2.168,"So for example,
here we have a text replay"
353.419,2.403,which is a clip of five action
355.888,2.536,"that the students
was doing in the tutor."
358.491,3.237,"And so in order to get
examples of gaming behavior,"
361.794,1.802,"a human will sit
at the computer,"
363.663,2.803,"look at the text replay,
and then make a judgement"
366.532,3.537,"on whether, uh,
this is an example of gaming"
370.136,1.935,"or it's an example
of not gaming."
372.138,2.569,"And so if we look
at the specific clip,"
374.774,2.402,"just to give you an idea,
what we can see"
377.243,1.902,"is that the first action
that the student is doing,"
379.212,2.102,"uh, they get the correct answer and then they move on"
381.38,2.503,"to the next step
that they're supposed to do."
383.95,2.502,"20 seconds later,
they answer minutes"
386.519,1.602,as the answer for that step.
388.187,2.736,"And the system tells
them that this an error."
390.99,2.236,"So four seconds later,
they enter hour"
393.292,1.535,which is again an error.
394.894,3.003,"And then seven seconds later
they answer years,"
397.964,1.468,again an error.
399.499,4.304,"And 14 seconds later, week
which is again an error."
403.87,2.402,"And so what we can see if we
look at this behavior"
406.339,3.103,"is a very systematic behavior
of trying to guess"
409.509,1.434,what the answer would be
411.01,2.236,"by entering
all the units of time"
413.312,2.036,"the student th-can think of
in order"
415.414,2.036,"from the smallest one
to the largest one."
417.517,2.802,"And so a human might look
at this behavior and say,"
420.386,1.602,I think that the student
422.054,1.736,"is currently trying
to game the system"
423.856,1.368,"because they're
trying to guess the answer."
425.291,4.838,"So, the human will do that
for a large amount of clips"
430.196,3.103,"of-of behavior from the student
to get the large amount"
433.366,2.969,"of example of gaming
and not gaming look like."
436.402,2.636,"And then once we have
those labels what we can do"
439.105,2.402,"is we can take them
and synchronize them"
441.574,1.969,"with the data
of what the student is doing."
443.609,2.937,"And then we can use that to
compute what we call features,"
446.612,2.803,"which is the variables
that are gonna be used"
449.482,2.235,to create our predictive model.
451.784,2.069,"And those features
are gonna summarize"
453.92,2.602,"the behavior of the student
in that example."
456.589,3.737,"So, this is a process that
we call feature engineering."
460.393,3.27,"So, in the context
of an intelligent tutor,"
463.729,2.803,well some of the feature engineering that we might do
466.599,2.669,"is look at
in that clip of action,"
469.335,2.903,"how many actions were
in that specific time window."
473.406,2.903,"What was the average time
taken between each actions?"
476.375,3.17,"Uh, how many times
does the student ask for help?"
479.612,2.135,How many answers were correct?
481.814,1.769,"How many answers
were incorrect?"
483.649,2.436,"Then once we've created
those features,"
486.152,1.168,we've computed them
487.386,1.735,"for the different examples
of gaming behavior we have,"
489.188,2.436,"then we can synchronize
everything together."
491.691,3.503,"And we get this information
about what the student was doing"
495.261,2.603,"while they were
gaming or not gaming."
497.93,1.468,"So for example here,"
499.465,1.468,"if we take the first row
of the table"
501.0,2.436,"then we can see that
for the first row"
503.502,1.936,"the student did six action,"
505.504,2.37,"and then
took three seconds per action."
507.94,4.705,"Which is fairly quick
and then they ask five hints."
512.712,1.034,"They've got
one correct answer,"
513.813,1.701,"and they didn't get
any incorrect answer."
515.581,3.47,"And the human label
this particular behavior"
519.118,1.535,as gaming the system.
520.72,2.702,"Now, once we've collected
all this data,"
523.489,2.603,"what we do is we use
machine learning algorithms,"
526.158,3.304,"uh, to try to identify
patterns in the data"
529.528,3.07,"that might not be easy
for human to pick up on."
533.799,1.869,"And so for example,
what we might want to do"
535.735,3.17,"is build something
we call a decision tree."
538.971,2.069,"So that tree
what it's gonna do,"
541.107,2.302,its gonna partition the data
543.476,2.102,"according to the differenet
values of the features"
545.645,2.769,"and then depending on the different values of the feature,"
548.481,2.369,"its gonna make a prediction
based-uh, saying"
550.917,2.068,"whether the student
is gaming or not gaming."
553.052,2.169,So if we get an example here
555.288,1.868,"of what a decision tree
might look like."
557.223,2.235,"Uh, we start
at the root of the tree"
559.525,1.602,which is the node at the top.
561.193,2.636,"So for each node
there's gonna be two branches,"
563.896,1.535,and it's gonna separate
565.498,1.902,"one of the features
into two partition."
567.466,2.837,"So, first of all here
we might have, uh,"
570.369,2.169,"the first node is looking
at the average time"
572.605,2.069,"that the student takes
for action."
574.74,2.503,"So, in this example
we might say,"
577.31,1.635,"Well, if the student is taking"
579.011,1.969,"more than three seconds
per action,"
581.047,1.835,then the student is not gaming
582.949,1.768,"because he's not going
fast enough."
584.784,2.936,"Uh, and then-but then
if the student is taking"
587.787,1.535,"three or less seconds
per action,"
589.388,2.236,"then we're gonna look
at the number of hints"
591.691,1.101,that were requested.
592.858,2.503,"If there's a large number
of hints that were requested,"
595.428,2.068,"we're gonna say the student
is gaming the system"
597.563,2.736,"because they're asking
a lot of hints and going fast."
600.366,2.636,"Now if the student
is not asking a lot of hints,"
603.069,2.869,"then maybe we wanna look at
the number of incorrect answer,"
606.005,2.803,"and say that if the student
is going fast and entering"
608.874,2.77,"a lot of incorrect answer they
might be gaming the system."
611.711,3.303,"So this model is not
an actual true model"
615.081,0.901,"of gaming the system,"
616.048,2.67,"it's just an example to kind
of illustrate the process."
618.784,1.769,"A real model
of gaming the system"
620.619,1.902,"would probably be
much more complex."
623.689,2.202,"Now, once we have that model,
what we can do is"
625.958,2.302,"we can take data about
the behavior of the student"
628.327,2.336,"and use it to get
a prediction from the model."
630.73,3.536,"So for example, if the student
has an average time"
634.333,2.903,"for action of eight seconds,
ask for hints five times,"
637.303,1.935,and has three incorrect answers
639.305,2.936,"then we'll go into the tree
and we'll take the right branch"
642.308,2.069,"depending on the value
of the feature."
644.443,1.268,And what we're gonna see here
645.778,1.568,"is that because
the average time for action"
647.413,2.569,is greater than three seconds then the model is gonna say
650.049,3.337,"that is not
an, uh, gaming behavior."
653.452,3.103,"And then we could do
the same thing"
656.622,1.735,for a different example
658.424,2.169,"where the student took
three seconds per action"
660.659,2.837,"on average,
asked hints six times,"
663.562,2.203,"and entered
zero incorrect answer."
665.831,2.903,"And now we would take
the right branch at first,"
668.801,2.135,"because the time is smaller
than or equal to three."
671.003,1.802,"And then we would take
the right branch again,"
672.872,2.235,"because the number of hints
is greater than four."
675.174,2.769,"In that-in that case
the model would predict"
678.01,3.137,"that the student is currently
gaming the system."
681.213,3.571,"So this is kind of the
process to build the model."
684.85,2.736,"Now once we have the model,
what we'll wanna do"
687.653,2.136,"is evaluate
is this a good model."
689.855,1.802,"Uh, so I won't go into details"
691.724,2.369,"on how to evaluate
if it's a good model or not."
694.16,2.335,"But just to give you
a general idea,"
696.562,2.236,"what we're gonna do is
we're gonna take the model"
698.864,3.137,and we're gonna reapply it to data for which we have labels.
702.068,1.534,And then we're gonna compare
703.669,2.169,the labels and the prediction from the model.
705.905,3.67,"Uh, ideally that's gonna
be done on data that's new"
709.642,2.202,"and unseen when we
were building the model."
711.911,2.602,"So, what you might want to do
is take your initial data"
714.58,4.071,"and then get a part of the data
and use it to build your model"
718.717,1.769,and then take part of the data
720.553,2.202,"and keep it aside for later
to test on it."
722.822,3.403,"Uh, you can also use
more advanced techniques"
726.292,1.234,such as cross validation
727.593,2.503,"which I'm not gonna describe
in this video."
730.162,2.069,"So, now if we go back
to our data,"
732.298,2.235,we can add a column in our table
734.6,2.135,"to say what did
the model predict?"
736.802,2.336,"So, in this specific example,"
739.205,2.369,"if I use the model
that I shown earlier,"
741.64,2.803,"what we would get is that
out of five examples"
744.51,2.669,"the model would get
the right prediction four times."
747.246,3.403,"Which means that the model
would have an accuracy of 80%."
750.716,4.004,"So there is many different
ways to evaluate"
754.787,1.268,the performance of a model.
756.122,1.668,"Many different
metrics you can use."
757.857,2.469,"Um, each one are gonna have
their own strengths,"
760.392,1.869,"so it's up to you
to decide which one"
762.328,1.868,"is more appropriate
for your data."
764.263,2.469,"Or you can also compute
more than one metric."
766.799,3.704,"So some of them include
accuracy, precision, recall,"
770.569,2.002,"Cohen's Kappa, uh,"
772.638,3.704,and the area under the ROC curve also known as AUC.
778.144,2.068,"And now just
to quickly conclude this video,"
780.279,4.171,"uh, what we did here is
we took a very quick overview"
784.517,3.336,"of how predictive modeling
can be used in education."
787.92,2.502,"Uh, we can see that it has
many different applications."
790.489,1.235,"Uh, for example,"
791.79,3.371,"when we're studying behavior such as gaming the system, uh,"
795.227,2.436,"then we might use our model
to study the relationship"
797.73,2.502,"between the behavior itself
and learning outcomes."
800.299,3.17,"So maybe student who engage
in more lo-gaming the system,"
803.536,2.902,"uh, don't perform
as well on future tests."
806.505,1.468,Or we can use the model
808.04,2.369,"to inform teacher about what's going on with the student,"
810.476,2.936,"so that the teacher
can look at the report and see,"
813.479,2.402,"oh there's a lot of gaming
going on with this student"
815.948,2.169,and I better go and figure out what's going on.
818.184,2.135,"How I can better support
the sys-the student?"
820.386,3.87,"Or we could use the model to
drive automated interventions"
824.323,3.804,"in the system itself to offset
negative learning outcomes."
828.194,1.401,"So maybe if we observe
that the student"
829.662,2.202,"is gaming the system
pretty often,"
831.931,3.737,then we maybe we can propose remedial learning activities
835.734,2.369,"to try to improve
the learning for that student."
