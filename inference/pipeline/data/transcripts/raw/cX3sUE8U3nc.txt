9.2,3.84,hi everyone welcome back today we will
11.36,4.64,discuss another topic in the subject
13.04,5.2,computer graphic is image processing you
16.0,5.039,all know that image is nothing but a
18.24,5.279,picture then what about this processing
21.039,5.841,processing is nothing but performing
23.519,5.201,some operation so image processing means
26.88,4.239,capturing an image
28.72,5.359,and that image is going to be processed
31.119,5.361,in a way that it can be modified or it
34.079,4.721,can be sharpened so whatever the user
36.48,5.2,requirement based on that the image can
38.8,4.64,be processed in this video i am going to
41.68,3.52,explain about what is the image
43.44,4.16,processing that is the definition of
45.2,3.839,image the different applications of
47.6,4.56,image processing
49.039,3.921,benefits of using the image processing
52.16,3.12,and
52.96,5.119,the different components of image
55.28,4.48,processing now let's start with image
58.079,3.521,processing definition
59.76,4.88,image processing means performing
61.6,5.44,operation on an image in order to get
64.64,4.96,enhanced image whatever the image you
67.04,5.28,have taken that has to be processed and
69.6,5.92,you will get an enhanced image or to
72.32,6.08,extract some useful information from it
75.52,5.36,that you call it as an image processing
78.4,4.64,okay let me give a clarity by taking a
80.88,4.559,live example suppose if you are
83.04,4.96,searching for any shop
85.439,4.961,so if you see the flex board
88.0,4.799,what you'll do your first your eyes will
90.4,5.44,uh first capture the board the flex
92.799,5.28,board and your brain will process it and
95.84,5.12,it is decide whether this is an exact
98.079,5.441,shop that you are searching or not
100.96,5.6,right means here what happening
103.52,5.84,image is the flexboard and your eyes are
106.56,4.32,capturing that image and your brain is
109.36,3.6,processing it
110.88,5.44,and it is giving a conclusion whether
112.96,5.439,this is exact shop or not so it is a
116.32,4.479,human uh if you consider the image
118.399,5.281,processing in the human
120.799,5.521,in the same way suppose uh if you take
123.68,4.96,the traffic signals whenever
126.32,4.24,your ice is going to capture the green
128.64,4.959,light
130.56,5.36,so and your brain is process it then we
133.599,4.481,will start moving whenever the green
135.92,3.76,light is appeared
138.08,3.28,so that is
139.68,4.0,image processing while we are talking
141.36,5.36,about the human being human being
143.68,4.96,processing capturing is through eyes and
146.72,3.76,processing through brain
148.64,4.56,in the same way
150.48,4.0,the image is captured if you talk about
153.2,4.08,in the techno
154.48,4.32,technical terms the image is captured
157.28,3.84,through camera
158.8,3.36,okay with the help of suppose the camera
161.12,3.199,is there
162.16,3.52,so with the help of the camera image is
164.319,3.28,captured
165.68,4.88,and inside the system with the help of
167.599,5.28,some algorithms we are modifying that
170.56,4.72,refining that and whatever the image
172.879,3.841,that you want enhanced image or extract
175.28,3.36,if you want extract some useful
176.72,4.64,information on that picture that
178.64,5.36,whatever the user requirement
181.36,5.76,the output will be appeared
184.0,5.84,okay so what this image processing will
187.12,5.199,be doing the process starts with
189.84,3.44,existing image it just take an existing
192.319,2.401,image
193.28,4.319,and refining
194.72,4.879,modifying in such a way that to obtain
197.599,4.401,another image
199.599,4.481,it performs operations on images like it
202.0,4.319,will do rotation it can make it as a
204.08,5.2,blurriness it can create a sharpness
206.319,5.681,images so different operations it can be
209.28,4.08,performed
212.0,3.84,now let's have a look on the
213.36,3.76,applications of image processing image
215.84,3.36,sharpening
217.12,3.839,we are going to use in the medical field
219.2,4.319,image processing is used in the medical
220.959,5.2,field remote sensing transmission and
223.519,4.161,encoding pattern recognition video
226.159,2.961,processing so these are all the
227.68,3.6,different areas where the image
229.12,4.319,processing is using
231.28,4.8,so here if you see this picture
233.439,5.121,uh let's capture an image so this is a
236.08,5.04,complete image that we captured
238.56,6.64,if you want a detailed study about a
241.12,5.119,small flower you just capture only that
245.2,3.119,picture
246.239,5.121,and you can refine it
248.319,4.881,and you can create uh
251.36,4.8,modifications on that
253.2,4.879,okay so that this is a way of image
256.16,4.16,processing
258.079,5.041,capturing the image
260.32,4.4,and processing whatever you want you can
263.12,3.519,make the complete background as a
264.72,3.68,blurred and you can take whatever the
266.639,3.84,information that you want you can
268.4,4.0,extract the information whatever
270.479,5.121,whatever you want with the help of this
272.4,3.2,image processing
276.08,4.32,now uh coming to the next concept the
278.4,3.68,analog image processing and digital
280.4,3.68,image processing actually there are two
282.08,4.24,types of image processing either you can
284.08,4.72,perform in analog mode or in it in a
286.32,5.52,digital mode so what is this analog and
288.8,5.2,what is it digital let's have a look
291.84,5.359,the analog image processing is applied
294.0,5.12,on analog signals and it process only
297.199,4.161,two dimensional signals
299.12,4.72,and the main use of this analog image
301.36,4.8,processing is on hard copy of images
303.84,5.68,means you just take a hard copies like
306.16,5.68,x-rays and you can take the print out so
309.52,5.04,on that only the analog image processing
311.84,4.24,can be applied and the output is always
314.56,3.52,an image whatever the image you are
316.08,2.959,captured the output will be that image
318.08,3.52,only
319.039,5.201,analog image processing is slower and
321.6,4.96,costlier processor so that's why mostly
324.24,4.56,we go we are not preferring to use
326.56,3.68,analog image processing we always look
328.8,3.6,about the digital image processing
330.24,4.48,nowadays the complete world is
332.4,5.04,concentrating on and using the digital
334.72,5.199,environment only so what is this digital
337.44,4.4,image processing
339.919,4.081,the digital image processing is applied
341.84,5.6,to digital signals that work on
344.0,5.039,analyzing what is it doing it analyzing
347.44,4.0,manipulating
349.039,4.401,the image based on computer algorithms
351.44,4.64,with the help of the computer algorithms
353.44,5.599,only the image digital image is captured
356.08,5.76,through cameras okay and it is analyzing
359.039,5.041,and manipulating and the output may be
361.84,5.04,an image or it can give some useful
364.08,4.8,information associated with that image
366.88,4.08,it is not compulsory every time it will
368.88,4.24,give only the output as an image but in
370.96,4.239,analog image processing the output is
373.12,4.72,always image but in digital image
375.199,4.321,processing it is not only the image but
377.84,4.56,it can give the useful information
379.52,4.959,regarding that image also
382.4,4.88,digital image processing is cheaper and
384.479,4.641,faster image storages and retrieval
387.28,5.68,process so that's why we are using
389.12,5.6,digital image processing nowadays
392.96,4.64,now coming to different benefits of
394.72,5.039,using the uh image processing the
397.6,4.0,processing of image is very fast and is
399.759,4.481,in less cost
401.6,4.879,obviously so because of that only
404.24,5.2,nowadays everyone is focusing and using
406.479,4.961,this uh digital image processing because
409.44,4.0,the processing of image is very fast
411.44,4.96,when compared to the analog also and it
413.44,4.8,is less in cost also there is no fixing
416.4,3.919,and processing chemicals are needed to
418.24,4.32,take and process digital image simply
420.319,4.401,you can capture the image how many
422.56,3.28,images that you want you can capture
424.72,2.879,there is no
425.84,4.56,need of fixing anything and there you
427.599,3.6,don't require any chemicals to process
430.4,2.96,them
431.199,4.4,to capture the image
433.36,5.04,when we take the image or issue we can
435.599,4.481,see it immediately it is good or not and
438.4,3.12,seeing the camera you are just finding
440.08,3.519,and you are just looking that whether
441.52,4.88,you got the picture clarity or not
443.599,5.121,everything so it is very easy
446.4,4.56,copying the digital image is easy and
448.72,5.599,the quality of the image remains as it
450.96,7.04,is taken no harm to it so the quality is
454.319,5.6,also a superb and at the same time
458.0,3.599,if you want to copy the digital image it
459.919,4.161,is very easy
461.599,6.88,changing the image format and resolution
464.08,5.76,image can be used in number of medias
468.479,3.361,now
469.84,4.639,there is a doubt how an image is
471.84,4.639,acquired and how it is stored in digital
474.479,3.921,format so everyone is getting a doubt
476.479,3.361,how these images are acquiring and how
478.4,4.72,we are going to store in the digital
479.84,5.039,format let's have a look here
483.12,4.079,the image can be acquired with the help
484.879,4.401,of a camera directly or by another
487.199,4.72,similar devices not only camera you can
489.28,5.12,take your mobile phones you can take any
491.919,3.84,shooting devices anything so you can
494.4,3.76,capture that
495.759,5.201,image with the help of that devices
498.16,5.12,first thing next it can also obtain from
500.96,5.2,another analog devices like photographic
503.28,4.639,films printed papers image scanners so
506.16,4.64,not only in digitally you can also
507.919,5.04,captured by analog
510.8,4.4,it is representation of visual
512.959,4.64,characteristics of objects like an
515.2,3.36,exterior and interior structure of an
517.599,2.961,object
518.56,5.359,and it also includes the printing
520.56,4.88,storage processing compression etc so if
523.919,3.92,you talk about the digital format
525.44,4.48,storage the digital image contains a
527.839,4.161,fixed number of pixels in rows and
529.92,5.919,columns this is already i discussed
532.0,3.839,whenever i talked about the pixels
536.08,4.319,the digital image contains a fixed
538.24,3.84,number of pixels that is arranged in
540.399,3.681,rows and columns
542.08,5.28,and the pixel gets stored in computer
544.08,5.52,memory according to the size
547.36,5.36,these values are often transmitted and
549.6,5.919,stored in compressed form
552.72,3.92,so see here this is a capture digital
555.519,3.361,image
556.64,4.879,image capturing
558.88,4.079,okay and here image display that is the
561.519,4.481,output screen
562.959,5.281,so whenever image is captured that sent
566.0,4.8,into the computer or any electronic
568.24,5.12,gadget for processing that image
570.8,5.2,this is the digital image
573.36,3.36,so here the user the person who is want
576.0,3.68,to
576.72,4.799,modify that image and his image analysis
579.68,4.0,and computer vision
581.519,4.88,with the help of a computer graphics it
583.68,4.56,sends the data here and there is image
586.399,5.44,processing the final output is going to
588.24,3.599,be displayed on image display
592.959,4.961,so now coming to different components of
595.6,4.64,image processing with its requirement
597.92,5.919,the first component here i'm talking
600.24,5.039,about is a image sensor so what is this
603.839,3.921,image sensor
605.279,5.441,image sensors are used for sensing the
607.76,5.199,objects the first first component in
610.72,4.96,image processing is first you need to
612.959,4.721,censor the object
615.68,4.48,if you want to capture the object first
617.68,5.12,you need to sense it right so image
620.16,5.52,sensor used for sensing the object image
622.8,5.2,sensors firstly capture the coming light
625.68,4.24,and then converts it into an electrical
628.0,3.92,signals
629.92,3.919,then measures the signals and give you
631.92,2.8,the output in the form of electronic
633.839,2.961,print
634.72,4.559,so its basic nature is to convert the
636.8,3.68,photons into electrons that is the image
639.279,3.201,sensor
640.48,4.479,and coming to the next component that is
642.48,5.2,the hardware of image processing okay
644.959,4.961,what type of hardware you required for
647.68,4.08,image processing
649.92,4.32,it is a hardware that performs the
651.76,4.8,arithmetic logic unit which is used to
654.24,4.56,perform some arithmetic and logical
656.56,4.24,operations on image so if you take the
658.8,5.84,image it has to perform some arithmetic
660.8,5.68,and logical uh calculations means
664.64,4.08,the pixel should be added the pixel
666.48,3.599,should be removed and how much quantity
668.72,3.52,you need to be added so that the
670.079,4.481,sharpness will be appeared so like that
672.24,4.56,so it has to be performed on arithmetic
674.56,4.56,logic unit
676.8,4.159,this dedicates hardware is just used to
679.12,2.959,pass the result to its general purpose
680.959,2.801,computer
682.079,3.44,and the third component of image
683.76,4.639,processing and its requirement is
685.519,4.641,computer or a pc you you required it to
688.399,4.161,perform an operation you require
690.16,4.4,something right so this computer is a
692.56,4.32,general purpose computer which is
694.56,4.24,regularly used on our daily life for
696.88,3.76,performing many operations just like
698.8,4.4,your laptops your
700.64,7.199,tablet anything an interaction media or
703.2,4.639,a way between human beings and a machine
707.92,5.44,the next component is a software for
710.16,6.56,image processing a software is a machine
713.36,5.2,inner tool remember student whatever the
716.72,4.64,software we are taking that software is
718.56,4.959,a machine inner tool
721.36,4.56,which is used to perform some specific
723.519,4.721,tasks like writing the code converting
725.92,4.479,some codes so this software is built
728.24,4.56,according to the mechanism
730.399,5.361,and algorithm that are used in the image
732.8,5.599,processing machines
735.76,4.879,and the next component is storage okay
738.399,5.201,the inner algorithms is also ready so we
740.639,4.88,converted that image into our use
743.6,3.919,user requirement
745.519,4.56,then next we need to store that so
747.519,4.481,storage ma storage so this is used for
750.079,4.481,storing purpose which is present in the
752.0,5.04,form of machine readable code in the
754.56,4.16,machine only in the machine only a
757.04,4.08,storage will be there the image
758.72,3.919,processing data storage will be there so
761.12,3.68,that is also in the form of machine
762.639,4.081,readable code
764.8,3.599,here the data can be stored in large
766.72,3.52,amount of form
768.399,4.481,and the next component displaying the
770.24,4.48,image okay image is also stored then
772.88,3.759,find finally we need to display the
774.72,3.76,image so where you are going to display
776.639,4.481,this is the last stage where the final
778.48,4.56,output will be displayed on the monitor
781.12,4.24,this will be displayed mainly in the
783.04,4.32,colored monitors or in colored form
785.36,2.96,anything
787.36,3.68,okay
788.32,4.24,okay suppose if you want any hard copy
791.04,3.52,uh if you want to display in your
792.56,3.92,monitor it can be displayed if you want
794.56,4.88,again the hard copy just after
796.48,5.359,completion of all the process this piece
799.44,4.72,of data can be stored in any hard
801.839,4.321,machine like you can store it in pen
804.16,3.84,drive external rom devices or any
806.16,3.76,external devices
808.0,4.56,and finally it is a networking if you
809.92,4.719,want to transfer your image digital
812.56,3.44,image processing from one system to
814.639,3.041,another system you can use the
816.0,3.519,networking
817.68,4.0,to transmit the data or image
819.519,5.12,information from computer to computer
821.68,5.04,the network is very needed the speed of
824.639,4.481,transmission can be measured by its
826.72,4.64,transmission bandwidth remember student
829.12,4.719,the speed of transmission can be
831.36,3.76,measured only by its transmission
833.839,3.36,bandwidth
835.12,4.0,okay thank you if you're having any
837.199,4.891,doubts please let me know thanks for
