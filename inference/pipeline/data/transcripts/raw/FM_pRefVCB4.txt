0.0,3.84,hello and welcome to pseudocode this
1.68,5.04,video onwards we are going to start our
3.84,5.12,journey of design patterns and before i
6.72,3.76,go into the details of types of design
8.96,3.679,patterns and we start looking at
10.48,4.159,different class diagrams and code let's
12.639,4.48,first try to understand
14.639,4.881,why there are design patterns why do we
17.119,5.361,study them what is the use of design
19.52,5.28,patterns why are they so popular and
22.48,6.84,what actually every design pattern
24.8,4.52,entails so let's get started
36.88,3.92,even though there are different
38.8,4.72,techniques for object oriented modeling
40.8,3.759,like uml diagrams concept of classes and
43.52,2.64,objects
44.559,3.361,and there are different principles like
46.16,3.28,solid principles which we have discussed
47.92,3.2,if you have not watched those videos
49.44,3.279,please go and check them out even though
51.12,3.439,these principles exist even though there
52.719,4.241,are so many guidelines and techniques
54.559,4.32,still it is not possible to model the
56.96,3.919,real world in terms of objects and
58.879,4.32,classes there are some problems which
60.879,4.161,cannot actually directly be modeled
63.199,3.761,there are also some scenarios which do
65.04,3.6,not exist in real world but have to be
66.96,3.92,solved in code
68.64,4.88,in those cases there are different set
70.88,4.48,of problems that occur and there are
73.52,3.52,certain solutions to those problems
75.36,4.0,which have been solved in different
77.04,4.8,complex object-oriented problems such
79.36,5.119,problems occur in the world of
81.84,4.639,object-oriented software design
84.479,3.68,over and over again and there are some
86.479,4.161,solutions in order to solve those
88.159,4.561,problems and those solutions are very
90.64,4.479,definite so since we do not have to
92.72,4.399,reinvent the wheel and since all those
95.119,4.0,problems have been faced by expert
97.119,3.601,designers and software developers
99.119,3.521,previously they have come up with
100.72,3.28,different patterns using which they have
102.64,3.6,solved those problems and those
104.0,4.079,solutions have been robust over time
106.24,4.08,they have proven their worth over time
108.079,3.921,and hence we study these design patterns
110.32,4.799,using these design patterns we can
112.0,5.2,actually solve the complex and classic
115.119,4.561,problems in software world
117.2,4.08,and we don't have to go looking for new
119.68,3.28,solutions because these are tried and
121.28,4.159,tested solutions tried and tested
122.96,4.479,patterns which have been used and have
125.439,3.921,proven their worth over time
127.439,3.6,if i have to pick up the definition of a
129.36,3.36,design pattern from a book which i have
131.039,3.121,linked in the description the definition
132.72,3.599,of design pattern goes something like
134.16,5.12,this each pattern describes a problem
136.319,5.441,that occurs over and over multiple times
139.28,4.4,in our environment and core of the
141.76,4.16,solution to that problem that that you
143.68,4.559,can use a million times without ever
145.92,4.64,doing it same way twice
148.239,4.08,now what does this mean this means that
150.56,4.959,every pattern that we are going to study
152.319,5.28,is going to describe a problem
155.519,3.841,and the solution the core part of the
157.599,3.92,solution to that problem using that
159.36,4.959,pattern but the implementation of that
161.519,4.561,pattern by you or by someone else for
164.319,3.681,that similar kind of problem is not
166.08,3.6,going to be the same you will use that
168.0,3.68,pattern because as the name itself
169.68,3.68,suggest it's a pattern it's a template
171.68,3.52,you're going to use that pattern you're
173.36,4.159,going to use that pattern to identify
175.2,3.92,the problem to identify the core way of
177.519,3.44,solving that problem but your
179.12,3.759,implementation might vary depending on
180.959,3.841,the language depending on the context
182.879,4.08,depending on the domain of the problem
184.8,4.32,and hence one design pattern can be
186.959,3.521,implemented in different ways in order
189.12,3.28,to solve similar problems but the
190.48,3.759,implementation of those patterns can or
192.4,3.839,cannot be same again going by the
194.239,4.241,definition of for the design patterns by
196.239,4.801,the book any pattern consists of four
198.48,4.64,parts the pattern name itself the
201.04,4.64,problem the solution to that problem and
203.12,5.039,the consequences of using that pattern
205.68,4.639,let's see what each of these means
208.159,4.561,the pattern or the pattern name itself
210.319,4.321,actually gives you an idea about the
212.72,4.32,problem what that pattern is going to
214.64,4.64,solve or how that particular problem is
217.04,4.16,solved using that pattern when you hear
219.28,4.0,names like factory pattern or adapter
221.2,4.48,pattern or command of chain pattern you
223.28,5.12,get an idea from the name about the kind
225.68,5.119,of problem this pattern might be solving
228.4,4.24,also it's a good idea to have the name
230.799,3.761,for a pattern so that you can actually
232.64,4.0,communicate with your peers your other
234.56,4.08,developers and other stakeholders in an
236.64,3.28,effective way if they also understand
238.64,3.36,the same pattern that you are talking
239.92,4.879,about you can actually use the name of
242.0,5.28,that pattern in order to ease
244.799,4.241,your communication for example many of
247.28,3.76,us have been using different design
249.04,3.199,patterns i'm also among one of them that
251.04,2.72,we have been using different design
252.239,3.601,patterns but we don't know the name for
253.76,3.599,it yet and if someone asks that same
255.84,3.119,thing in an interview or in a
257.359,3.521,conversation we just don't know the name
258.959,3.441,it might sound very trivial to not
260.88,3.36,remember the names of patterns but
262.4,4.32,actually if you know the names of the
264.24,3.84,patterns that you're using or that uh
266.72,3.36,using those patterns if you're solving
268.08,4.32,the problems it makes it much easier for
270.08,4.399,you to communicate with others and
272.4,3.359,also to provide solution to others so
274.479,3.361,the pattern name just gives you a
275.759,3.44,vocabulary and a common ground to stand
277.84,3.12,on while carrying out the technical
279.199,3.681,discussions the next part of the design
280.96,4.72,pattern is the problem itself the
282.88,5.039,pattern actually describes the problem
285.68,3.84,it is going to solve this whole idea
287.919,3.361,comes from one of the books which has
289.52,3.679,been written about the towns and cities
291.28,3.919,the structuring of towns and cities if
293.199,4.321,you think about it all the towns and
295.199,4.641,cities have similar kind of problems how
297.52,3.92,the water flow will be taken care of how
299.84,3.68,the garbage will be taken care of how
301.44,3.84,the traffic of the city will be designed
303.52,3.92,so that people can move from one part of
305.28,4.08,the city to another and all those
307.44,4.479,problems have similar kind of solutions
309.36,4.64,we all have flyovers and signals in our
311.919,4.0,cities we all have garbage collected
314.0,3.919,trucks in our cities we all have an
315.919,4.56,underlying severe system in the cities
317.919,4.881,right so design pattern also describes
320.479,4.321,the kind of problem that we are solving
322.8,4.32,and then there is a solution to the
324.8,4.64,problem which brings us to the third
327.12,4.639,part of the pattern the solution itself
329.44,4.16,if you think about it for any city the
331.759,3.681,straightforward solution to control the
333.6,3.439,traffic is traffic signals
335.44,3.36,straightforward solution to control the
337.039,4.561,speed of the vehicles are the speed
338.8,4.64,breakers if a city wants to be green and
341.6,3.68,environmental friendly and it wants to
343.44,3.12,reduce number of vehicles on the road
345.28,3.52,there are solutions like public
346.56,4.56,transport which includes metros buses
348.8,4.72,etc similarly the pattern describes the
351.12,4.0,problem and the solution the problem
353.52,4.72,in the example that we're talking about
355.12,5.04,is moving of people from one place to
358.24,3.36,another without harming the environment
360.16,3.28,and the solution is
361.6,3.92,public transport the problem is
363.44,3.84,controlling the accidents in the in the
365.52,3.76,city controlling the speed of the
367.28,4.16,vehicles and the answer is speed breaker
369.28,4.24,similarly every design pattern which is
371.44,4.4,describing a problem will describe a
373.52,4.239,solution to that problem also that you
375.84,4.079,can go and use
377.759,3.761,in your code base or in your design you
379.919,3.84,can map actually the problem to the
381.52,3.6,problem and solution to the solution and
383.759,3.44,obviously the last part is the
385.12,3.6,consequences if you are going to apply a
387.199,4.0,design pattern obviously there are going
388.72,3.84,to be the pro and the basic pro is that
391.199,3.601,you get a solution to the problem that
392.56,3.84,you are solving but there are also going
394.8,3.6,to be cons of using certain design
396.4,3.919,patterns that also we will study with
398.4,3.919,each design pattern that where are the
400.319,3.281,situations where it is a good idea to
402.319,2.88,use a pattern and where are the
403.6,3.28,situations where it is not a good idea
405.199,4.081,to use such a pattern and just go with
406.88,4.56,the naive way or the direct way of
409.28,4.24,solving that problem again if we talk
411.44,4.319,about the example of cities true if you
413.52,4.56,build roads and good traffic signals and
415.759,4.72,good traffic uh control system in the
418.08,4.32,city it allows people to travel from one
420.479,4.16,place to another but the obvious con is
422.4,4.16,that you end up with a lot of people
424.639,2.96,emitting a lot of co2 in the environment
426.56,2.56,because they have their personal
427.599,3.6,vehicles then you come up with another
429.12,3.28,solution like public transport but then
431.199,2.801,again you have to care about the
432.4,3.519,security of the public transport and
434.0,3.599,running cost of the public transport so
435.919,4.081,that the government does not incur all
437.599,4.72,the losses while uh giving a reasonable
440.0,4.4,option to the uh citizens of that
442.319,3.6,particular city so
444.4,3.04,naturally any design pattern that you
445.919,4.0,are using it will it is going to have
447.44,4.4,some consequences some pros and cons and
449.919,3.601,weighing these pros and cons in order to
451.84,3.68,make a decision whether you should apply
453.52,3.76,that design pattern or not is one of the
455.52,3.679,very important part of your decision
457.28,3.28,making of your design decision making
459.199,3.361,and hence i am talking about the
460.56,4.319,structure of design pattern here
462.56,3.919,before we go ahead and act and learn the
464.879,3.121,actual design patterns these are the
466.479,2.881,things that we have to keep in mind
468.0,2.639,while learning and applying those
469.36,4.239,patterns
470.639,5.441,so this was the brief definition of what
473.599,4.641,design patterns entail why we study
476.08,4.0,design patterns and how can we use
478.24,4.16,design patterns so that they are useful
480.08,3.839,to us and are not creating any negative
482.4,3.04,impact on the design that we are
483.919,3.041,creating in the next video we are going
485.44,3.039,to talk about the organization of
486.96,3.919,different design patterns and the types
488.479,3.631,of design patterns till then take care
