1.04,4.48,we built computers to expand our brains
3.6,3.759,originally scientists built computers to
5.52,3.76,solve arithmetic but they turn out to be
7.359,2.801,incredibly useful for many other things
9.28,2.96,as well
10.16,3.92,running the entire internet life like
12.24,4.799,graphics artificial brains
14.08,4.959,or simulating the universe but amazingly
17.039,4.961,all of it boils down to just flipping
19.039,4.4,zeros and ones computers have become
22.0,3.439,smaller and more powerful
23.439,3.92,and an incredible rate there's more
25.439,4.281,computing power in your cell phone than
27.359,3.68,there was in the entire world in the
29.72,3.32,mid-1960s
31.039,4.641,and the entire apollo moon landing could
33.04,4.24,have been run on a couple of nintendos
35.68,3.36,computer science is a subject that
37.28,3.68,studies what computers can do
39.04,3.92,it's a diverse and overlapping field but
40.96,4.0,i'm gonna split it into three parts the
42.96,5.04,fundamental theory of computer science
44.96,4.16,computer engineering and applications
48.0,3.52,we'll start with the father of
49.12,4.24,theoretical computer science alan turing
51.52,2.559,who formalized the concept of a turing
53.36,2.4,machine
54.079,3.521,which is a simple description of a
55.76,3.52,general purpose computer
57.6,3.04,people came up with other designs for
59.28,3.04,computing machines but they're all
60.64,3.44,equivalent to a turing machine which
62.32,2.559,makes it the foundation of computer
64.08,3.12,science
64.879,3.681,a turing machine contains several parts
67.2,3.04,an infinitely long tape
68.56,3.68,that's split into cells containing
70.24,4.0,symbols there's also a head that can
72.24,3.919,read and write symbols to the tape
74.24,3.76,a state register that stores the state
76.159,3.121,of the head and a list of possible
78.0,3.04,instructions
79.28,3.519,in today's computers the tape is like
81.04,4.0,the working memory or ram
82.799,4.161,the head is the central processing unit
85.04,3.36,and the list of instructions is held in
86.96,3.04,the computer's memory
88.4,3.759,even though a turing machine is a simple
90.0,3.439,set of rules it's incredibly powerful
92.159,3.28,and this is essentially what all
93.439,3.761,computers do nowadays although
95.439,3.761,our computers obviously have a few more
97.2,3.68,parts like permanent storage and all the
99.2,3.279,other components
100.88,3.44,every problem that's computable by a
102.479,4.081,turing machine is computable using
104.32,4.479,lambda calculus which is the basis of
106.56,4.0,research in programming languages
108.799,4.161,computability theory attempts to
110.56,3.839,classify what is and isn't computable
112.96,3.519,there are some problems that due to
114.399,3.921,their very nature can never be solved by
116.479,3.041,a computer a famous example is the
118.32,2.88,halting problem where you try and
119.52,3.919,predict whether a program will stop
121.2,3.84,running or carry on forever there are
123.439,3.841,programs where this is impossible to
125.04,4.24,answer by a computer or a human
127.28,3.28,many problems are theoretically solvable
129.28,3.44,but in practice take
130.56,4.08,too much memory or more steps than the
132.72,3.36,lifetime of the universe to solve and
134.64,3.12,computational complexity
136.08,3.28,attempts to categorize these problems
137.76,2.96,according to how they scale
139.36,3.599,there are many different classes of
140.72,4.239,complexity and many classes of problem
142.959,3.681,that fall into each type
144.959,3.521,there are a lot of real world problems
146.64,3.92,that fall into these impossible to solve
148.48,4.479,categories but fortunately computer
150.56,2.959,scientists have a bunch of sneaky tricks
152.959,2.64,where you can
153.519,3.921,fudge things and get pretty good answers
155.599,2.241,but you'll never know if they're the
157.44,2.64,best
157.84,4.399,answer an algorithm is a set of
160.08,3.439,instructions independent of the hardware
162.239,3.761,or programming language
163.519,4.0,designed to solve a particular problem
166.0,2.56,it's kind of like a recipe of how to
167.519,2.961,build a program
168.56,3.6,and a lot of work is put into developing
170.48,2.64,algorithms to get the best out of
172.16,2.64,computers
173.12,4.0,different algorithms can get to the same
174.8,4.0,final result like sorting a random set
177.12,3.6,of numbers into order but
178.8,4.0,some algorithms are much more efficient
180.72,4.72,than others this is studied in
182.8,4.159,algorithmic complexity information
185.44,3.36,theorist studies the properties of
186.959,3.92,information and how it can be measured
188.8,3.84,stored and communicated
190.879,3.841,one application of this is how well you
192.64,3.92,can compress data making it take up less
194.72,2.72,memory while preserving all or most of
196.56,3.28,the information
197.44,4.48,but there are lots of other applications
199.84,2.64,related to information theory is coding
201.92,2.319,theory
202.48,3.52,and cryptography is obviously very
204.239,3.28,important for keeping information sent
206.0,3.04,over the internet secret
207.519,3.36,there are many different encryption
209.04,3.919,schemes which scramble data and usually
210.879,3.681,rely on some very complex mathematical
212.959,3.92,problem to keep the information
214.56,4.16,locked up these are the main branches of
216.879,3.44,theoretical computer science although
218.72,3.36,there are many more that i didn't have
220.319,4.56,time to go into like logic
222.08,4.159,graph theory computational geometry
224.879,4.64,automata theory
226.239,5.92,quantum computation parallel programming
229.519,5.28,formal methods and data structures but
232.159,4.481,let's move on to computer engineering
234.799,3.201,designing computers is a challenge
236.64,2.56,because they have to do so many
238.0,2.959,different things
239.2,3.36,designers need to try and make sure that
240.959,3.761,they're capable of solving many
242.56,3.12,different kinds of problems as optimally
244.72,2.48,as possible
245.68,3.04,every single task that runs on a
247.2,3.2,computer goes through the core of the
248.72,2.719,computer the cpu
250.4,3.039,when you're doing lots of different
251.439,2.561,things at the same time the cpu needs to
253.439,2.08,switch back
254.0,2.799,and forth between these jobs to make
255.519,2.4,sure everything gets done in a
256.799,2.96,reasonable time
257.919,4.0,this is controlled by a scheduler which
259.759,3.841,chooses what to do and when and tries to
261.919,3.521,get through the tasks in the most
263.6,3.2,efficient way which can be a very
265.44,3.199,difficult problem
266.8,4.0,multi-processing helps speed things up
268.639,4.721,because the cpu has several cores that
270.8,4.08,can execute multiple jobs in parallel
273.36,3.279,but this makes the job of the scheduler
274.88,3.92,even more complex
276.639,3.361,computer architecture is how a processor
278.8,2.959,is designed to perform
280.0,3.44,tasks and different architectures are
281.759,4.241,good at different things
283.44,5.28,cpus are general purpose gpus are
286.0,4.56,optimized for graphics and fpgas can be
288.72,3.84,programmed to be very fast at a very
290.56,3.52,narrow range of task
292.56,3.28,on top of the raw hardware there are
294.08,3.119,many layers of software written by
295.84,2.88,programmers using many different
297.199,3.681,programming languages
298.72,4.08,a programming language is how humans
300.88,3.759,tell a computer what to do and they vary
302.8,4.16,greatly depending on the job at hand
304.639,4.0,from low-level languages like assembly
306.96,3.12,through to high-level languages like
308.639,4.081,python or javascript
310.08,4.559,for coding websites and apps in general
312.72,3.84,the closer language is to the hardware
314.639,2.801,the more difficult it is for humans to
316.56,3.28,use
317.44,3.92,at all stages of this hierarchy the code
319.84,4.16,that programmers write needs to be
321.36,4.48,turned into raw cpu instructions
324.0,3.84,and this is done by one or several
325.84,3.52,programs called compilers
327.84,3.6,designing programming languages and
329.36,4.16,compilers is a big deal because they are
331.44,3.12,the tool that software engineers use to
333.52,2.959,make everything
334.56,4.079,so they need to be as easy to use as
336.479,4.401,possible but also versatile enough to
338.639,3.601,allow programmers to build their crazy
340.88,2.72,ideas
342.24,2.799,the operating system is the most
343.6,3.68,important piece of software on the
345.039,4.321,computer is it's what we interact with
347.28,4.32,and it controls how all of the other
349.36,4.24,programs are run on the hardware
351.6,3.92,and engineering a good operating system
353.6,3.76,is a huge challenge
355.52,4.08,this brings us to software engineering
357.36,3.679,writing bundles of instructions telling
359.6,3.12,the computer what to do
361.039,3.041,building good software is an art form
362.72,2.479,because you have to translate your
364.08,3.04,creative ideas
365.199,3.12,into these logical instructions in a
367.12,3.919,specific language
368.319,3.761,make it as efficient as possible to run
371.039,3.521,and as free of
372.08,4.48,errors as you can so there are many best
374.56,3.6,practices and design philosophies that
376.56,3.44,people follow
378.16,4.0,some other important areas are getting
380.0,4.16,many computers to communicate and work
382.16,4.08,together to solve problems
384.16,4.319,storing and retrieving large amounts of
386.24,4.959,data determining how well computer
388.479,4.481,systems are performing at specific tasks
391.199,4.0,and creating highly detailed and
392.96,3.76,realistic graphics
395.199,3.28,now we get to a really cool part of
396.72,3.599,computer science getting computers to
398.479,3.601,solve real world problems
400.319,4.32,these technologies underlie a lot of the
402.08,4.0,programs apps and websites we use
404.639,3.201,when you're going on vacation you want
406.08,4.0,to get the best trip for the money
407.84,4.24,you're solving an optimization problem
410.08,3.679,optimization problems appear everywhere
412.08,3.76,and finding the best path or most
413.759,4.16,efficient combination of parts can save
415.84,3.359,businesses millions of dollars
417.919,3.201,this is related to boolean
419.199,2.801,satisfiability where you attempt to work
421.12,3.6,out if a logic
422.0,4.4,formula can be satisfied or not this was
424.72,3.599,the first problem proved to be np
426.4,3.28,complete and so widely considered to be
428.319,3.201,impossible to solve
429.68,4.0,but amazing development of new sat
431.52,4.399,solvers means that huge sap problems are
433.68,3.84,solved routinely today especially in
435.919,3.761,artificial intelligence
437.52,3.679,computers extend our brains and multiply
439.68,3.12,our cognitive abilities
441.199,3.681,the forefront of computer science
442.8,3.679,research is developing computer systems
444.88,4.0,that can think for themselves
446.479,4.481,artificial intelligence there are many
448.88,3.84,avenues that ai research takes the most
450.96,2.72,prominent of which is machine learning
452.72,2.72,which aims to
453.68,3.76,develop algorithms and techniques to
455.44,3.199,enable computers to learn from large
457.44,2.8,amounts of data
458.639,3.68,and then use what they've learned to do
460.24,3.44,something useful like make decisions or
462.319,2.801,classify things
463.68,4.0,and there are many different types of
465.12,4.079,machine learning closely related are
467.68,3.519,fields like computer vision
469.199,3.921,trying to make computers able to see
471.199,5.041,objects in images like we do
473.12,5.04,which uses image processing techniques
476.24,4.0,natural language processing aims to get
478.16,4.24,computers to understand and communicate
480.24,4.16,using human language or to process large
482.4,2.799,amounts of data in the form of words for
484.4,2.72,analysis
485.199,3.761,this commonly uses another field called
487.12,3.199,knowledge representation where data is
488.96,2.48,organized according to their
490.319,2.481,relationships like
491.44,3.36,words with similar meanings are
492.8,3.839,clustered together machine learning
494.8,4.079,algorithms have improved because of the
496.639,4.081,large amount of data we give them
498.879,3.681,big data looks at how to manage and
500.72,2.879,analyze large amounts of data and get
502.56,2.8,value from it
503.599,3.6,and we'll get even more data from the
505.36,3.44,internet of things adding data
507.199,3.601,collection and communications to
508.8,3.84,everyday objects
510.8,3.28,hacking is not a traditional academic
512.64,2.24,discipline but definitely worth
514.08,2.639,mentioning
514.88,3.519,trying to find weaknesses and computer
516.719,3.44,systems and take advantage of them
518.399,3.681,without being noticed
520.159,4.24,computational science uses computers to
522.08,4.96,help answer scientific questions from
524.399,4.401,fundamental physics to neuroscience and
527.04,2.96,often makes use of super computing which
528.8,3.039,throws the way to the world's most
530.0,2.64,powerful computers of very large
531.839,3.521,problems
532.64,4.4,often in the area of simulation then
535.36,3.44,there is human computer interaction
537.04,4.479,which looks at how to design computer
538.8,5.039,systems to be easy and intuitive to use
541.519,3.201,virtual reality augmented reality and
543.839,3.361,telepresence
544.72,3.36,enhancing or replacing our experience of
547.2,2.56,reality
548.08,3.92,and finally robotics which gives
549.76,2.96,computers a physical embodiment from a
552.0,2.8,roomba
552.72,3.44,to trying to make intelligent human-like
554.8,3.36,machines
556.16,4.0,so that is my map of computer science a
558.16,2.72,field that's still developing as fast as
560.16,2.56,it ever has
560.88,4.0,despite the fact that the underlying
562.72,4.32,hardware is hitting some hard limits as
564.88,2.8,we struggle to miniaturize transistors
567.04,2.239,anymore
567.68,3.68,so lots of people are working on other
569.279,3.041,kinds of computers to try and overcome
571.36,3.44,this problem
572.32,4.56,computers have had an absolutely huge
574.8,3.599,impact on human society so it's going to
576.88,3.6,be interesting to see where this
578.399,2.88,technology goes in the next hundred
580.48,4.32,years
581.279,6.321,who knows perhaps one day we'll all be
584.8,2.8,computers
588.08,3.92,as per usual if you want to get hold of
