1.04,4.48,simple show explains design thinking
5.6,4.4,this is sarah in her new role as
8.0,3.92,innovation manager she's on the lookout
10.0,3.679,for methods she can use to drive forward
11.92,2.879,innovation in the product development
13.679,3.041,process
14.799,3.761,she's already heard of design thinking
16.72,2.58,and her colleague tom is ready to tell
18.56,2.24,her more
19.3,3.18,[Music]
20.8,3.84,design thinking is an approach to
22.48,3.52,solving complex problems and developing
24.64,3.28,new ideas
26.0,4.8,these are particularly focused on the
27.92,6.24,needs of customers or users the process
30.8,5.36,is made up of five consecutive stages
34.16,4.399,before they start tom and his team
36.16,4.399,identify what the problem actually is
38.559,3.921,and try to understand it
40.559,4.241,they then develop a suitable way of
42.48,5.68,posing the question which also defines
44.8,3.36,the challenges of the project
48.399,4.32,tom then analyzes the users in the first
50.8,3.2,phase for example by carrying out
52.719,3.36,interviews
54.0,3.84,this provides him with key insights
56.079,4.64,which helps him understand things from
57.84,4.879,the user's position
60.719,4.16,these findings are then used in the next
62.719,4.641,stage to help tom define the user's
64.879,4.56,perspective he can thus identify the
67.36,4.799,user's problems and then derive their
69.439,4.641,needs from this
72.159,4.32,these serve as a basis for the next
74.08,4.24,stage ideation
76.479,4.161,tom and his team hold intense
78.32,4.56,brainstorming sessions to develop and
80.64,4.159,visualize concepts based on the user's
82.88,4.239,needs
84.799,4.561,next comes the prototype stage
87.119,4.481,so that the new ideas can be tested and
89.36,4.24,demonstrated prototypes are developed
91.6,3.28,for solutions to the problems defined at
93.6,3.6,the start
94.88,4.72,these are used to obtain valuable user
97.2,4.64,feedback
99.6,4.64,the method ends with refining the idea
101.84,4.4,in the test stage in this phase the
104.24,4.08,insights gained from the prototype stage
106.24,4.32,are used to improve the concept for as
108.32,4.159,long as it takes to create an optimized
110.56,4.239,user-oriented product
112.479,5.521,this iterative step can refer back to
114.799,3.201,all of the previous steps
118.399,4.641,sarah is very impressed the design
121.04,4.32,thinking approach results in creative
123.04,4.32,problem solving and innovative products
125.36,3.92,and business segments thus paving the
127.36,4.92,way for more innovation in sarah's
129.28,3.0,projects
