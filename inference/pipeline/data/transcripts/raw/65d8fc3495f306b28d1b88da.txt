What is a programming paradigm?   
A programming paradigm refers to a style or
method of writing a program.  
Let's assume you asked ten people to create
an omelet; they would each prepare it differently.
Which of the following is the typical method
for making an omelet?
A similar issue will arise if you ask ten
persons to complete the identical program;
they will each complete it in their way.
So programming paradigms are different techniques
for writing your program.
It is critical to understand how we will write
a program. Understanding the programming paradigm
is necessary for that.
When selecting a programming language for
building a program or software, we must ensure
that it supports the programming paradigms.
Why do we need a programming paradigm?
One of my favorite coding quotes is
"Any idiot can create code that a machine
can understand; skilled programmers produce
code that humans can understand."
Consider building software with 10,000 lines
of code with a group of people.
What happens if they all create the software
in their style?
First and foremost, the program's complexity
will rise.
The program's readability and structure will
suffer.
It will be tough to test, and updating the
code will be incredibly complex.
What will happen if everyone writes your application
using a set standard?
We can reduce many of the problems.
A programming paradigm will assist us in resolving
all problems.
Thus, the programming paradigm offers a unique
standard for developing programs and software.
Types of Programming paradigm
The two sorts of programming paradigms are
imperative programming and declarative programming.
The two types of imperative programming are
procedural and object-oriented.
There are two types of declarative programming:
logical and functional.
Let us examine each of these points in further
depth.
Imperative Programming
The word imperative implies "command."
Imperative programming tells the computer
how to complete a task by giving a list of
commands or instructions in a specific order.
The order of instructions is significant in
imperative programming.
In this example, we are giving the computer
line-by-line instructions on how to add two
numbers and subtract two numbers.
Procedural Programming
In procedural programming, we divide the problem
into smaller subproblems. We often refer to
this structured approach.
A procedure is a chunk of code that performs
a specified task.
Data and logic are separate entities in procedural
programming. 
Here have two procedures add two numbers and
subtract two numbers.
The main procedure will call this sub-procedure
to add and subtract numbers.
Object Oriented Programming
In object-oriented programming, we will use
classes and objects to create an entire program.
The whole program will run depending on object
interactions.
Objects are real-world entities with properties
and behavior.
The Classes act as the object's blueprint.
Classes describe the characteristics and behavior
of objects.
In this example, you can see that we have
three classes: calculator, addition, and subtraction.
The addition class is in charge of adding
two numbers.
The subtraction class is in charge of subtracting
two integers.
So the calculator class will call the addition
and subtraction classes to add and subtract
two numbers.
Here, all three classes interact to produce
a result.
Declarative Programming
In declarative programming, we tell the computer
what to do rather than how to do it.
We shall always focus on output or result
in declarative programming.
In this sample code, we are telling the database
what we want rather than how it should do.
Functional and logical programming are the
two main subtypes.
Functional Programming
In functional programming, we will split the
entire program into two functions.
Each function takes some parameters as input
and returns the output.
JavaScript is one example of a functional
program.
Here in the example, we have three functions.
The "addTwoNumber" function adds two integers;
the "subtractTwoNumber" method subtracts two
integers.
So these two functions have two parameters
like I, j. It returns the output.
So the calculate function is responsible for
adding and subtracting two numbers.
Logic Programming
Logic programming is composed of facts and
causes rather than instruction
In logic programming, we will build an entire
program based on the notation of logical detection.
Logic programming uses its knowledge to arrive
at a true or false conclusion.
Example prolog language.
In this example, we tell the computer, "Socrates
is a man," and we say, "All men are mortal."
Then we ask the computer, "Is Socrates mortal?"
The computer will then use its knowledge to
reply "yes."
Conclusion
In the previous section, we learned how to
write a program in different programming styles.
The same program has rewritten it in different
ways.
For example Functional programming, we split
the program into small functions.
In a procedure, We divided the entire program
into individual procedures.
In object-oriented programming, the whole
program is split into objects.
So it is clear that using a programming paradigm
reduces the complexity and increases the program's
maintainability.
