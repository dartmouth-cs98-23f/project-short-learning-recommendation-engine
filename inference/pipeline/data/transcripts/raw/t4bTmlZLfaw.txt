13.63,6.39,welcome to the lecture ten and the final
16.84,5.849,lecture in the our module of the course
20.02,4.62,data science for engineers in the
22.689,4.051,previous lectures we have seen what are
24.64,5.969,the basic data types that are supported
26.74,6.12,by our how to write scripts how to write
30.609,4.321,functions and how to do control
32.86,5.46,structures how to do programming and so
34.93,6.03,on in this lecture we are going to show
38.32,4.8,you how to generate some basic graphic
40.96,6.27,such as scatter plot line plot and bar
43.12,7.23,plot using Earth and will also give a
47.23,6.149,brief idea on why there is a need for
50.35,5.22,more sophisticated graphics and how R
53.379,6.151,does it first we will consider scatter
55.57,6.809,plot scatter plot is one of the most
59.53,4.89,widely used Lots where we have some
62.379,4.471,independent variable and dependent
64.42,6.03,variable when you want to see how a
66.85,5.82,dependent variable is dependent on the
70.45,5.52,independent variable you can use scatter
72.67,6.96,plot generating the scatter plot in R is
75.97,8.07,quite simple the first command here
79.63,7.919,shows it is creating a vector which is
84.04,7.369,having the elements from 1 to 10 and the
87.549,7.5,next command here takes this X and
91.409,8.231,calculates the element wise square of
95.049,9.6,the X and then assign it to value y when
99.64,8.759,you plot y it will generate this plot
104.649,8.061,here since we haven't specified what is
108.399,7.351,X which is independent variable R
112.71,6.43,generates its own independent variable
115.75,6.39,as the index since this vector contains
119.14,4.589,10 elements it will create the index
122.14,5.79,based on the number of elements in the
123.729,7.501,vector and then the by values which are
127.93,9.809,the squares of elements 1 to 10 that are
131.23,8.76,1 4 9 and so on are shown in the y axis
137.739,6.001,and 10 square is hundred
139.99,6.93,final value here on the y axis as 100
143.74,5.82,let us illustrate the scatterplot using
146.92,6.99,some inbuilt data set that is available
149.56,7.98,in I so we are talking about a data set
153.91,6.36,by name empty cars so you can access
157.54,5.7,this data set by just typing empty cars
160.27,6.03,this data set is a data frame which
163.24,7.32,contains 32 observations on 11 variables
166.3,7.41,the variables are listed here such as
170.56,8.4,number of cylinders which is represented
173.71,9.15,by variable c YN + MPG what is the -
178.96,8.61,that this cars gives that is miles per
182.86,9.23,US gallon and weight WD which is weight
187.57,7.88,of the car and so on now let us try to
192.09,9.46,plot a scatter plot between weight and
195.45,9.01,mpg of this data frame to do that what
201.55,5.88,we need to use is plot command this is
204.46,6.09,your independent variable car weight
207.43,6.93,this is your dependent variable miles
210.55,7.67,per gallon and this main helps in naming
214.36,7.8,the title of the graph X lab to give a
218.22,7.84,label for x-axis y lab is used to give a
222.16,5.97,label for y axis and this PCH
226.06,5.52,corresponds to different shapes for
228.13,5.97,points and speciation is called 19
231.58,4.86,corresponds to thee the shape that is
234.1,4.56,shown in this screen you can use
236.44,5.15,different PCH values to obtain different
238.66,6.51,shapes for the points in a scatter plot
241.59,5.31,next we move the line plot we can take
245.17,4.58,same example what we have seen earlier
246.9,6.19,if the same plot command can be used
249.75,6.16,what you need to do to generate a line
253.09,6.57,plot is to specify an extra argument
255.91,7.08,type which is yelling so type is equal
259.66,6.3,to L generates a line instead of the
262.99,5.85,scatter plot next we move on to the bar
265.96,6.479,plot the syntax to generate bar plot and
268.84,7.229,R is as follows bar not
272.439,6.99,of H these are the heights which can be
276.069,5.4,a vector and Matt assists to keep it
279.429,6.75,simple we'll deal with only letters and
281.469,7.861,names that argument what this argument
286.179,7.32,does is it will print the names under
289.33,6.179,the each attribute in the H X lab and my
293.499,3.84,lab and main has the same meanings as
295.509,5.64,what we have seen for the scatterplot
297.339,7.2,and color gives us an option to give
301.149,5.76,color to the bar plot this is the R code
304.539,6.03,that can be used to generate them but
306.909,6.69,not I want to define H heights of the
310.569,8.88,bar codes as a vector which is having
313.599,7.68,the values 712 28 3 and 41 and I want to
319.449,4.351,create another vector which is a
321.279,6.21,character variable which is having the
323.8,5.369,values March April May June and July and
327.489,5.22,now I am trying to create a bath lot
329.169,7.95,with HS heights and name start arguments
332.709,6.66,SEM X lab as month while I best Avenue
337.119,6.39,and the color of the bar notes I want is
339.369,7.92,blue and the title is revenue chart and
343.509,5.851,the border is red so when you execute
347.289,4.321,these commands this is how the bar plot
349.36,6.959,looks these are the heights of the bar
351.61,6.719,charts this is the 3 ok and then in the
356.319,5.43,names that are variable we have March
358.329,7.26,April May June and July which is printed
361.749,6.57,at the bottom of each height and the
365.589,5.25,x-axis is month y-axis is revenue and
368.319,4.14,the title is lemon nature now let us see
370.839,3.9,why there is a need for sophisticated
372.459,4.77,graphics let us say there is a need for
374.739,5.19,you to show multiple plots in a single
377.229,5.45,figure as shown below how do you do this
379.929,6.0,what are the challenges that you face
382.679,7.57,when you want to create figure that was
385.929,7.23,shown in the earlier slide so the exact
390.249,6.6,figure can be reproduced using this code
393.159,5.97,which is shown here for this what you
396.849,4.62,have to know is you have no way to
399.129,5.12,introduce value which columns have data
401.469,4.721,for them to be selected for plot E and
404.249,4.161,you have to also pose
406.19,5.19,she eats crap in the green etc even
408.41,5.73,though you do all of this operations the
411.38,5.78,visuals are less pleasing that is where
414.14,6.99,we need more sophisticated graphics
417.16,7.03,packages in our this is where the
421.13,6.72,ggplot2 comes into picture the ggplot2
424.19,5.85,provides a very beautiful package for
427.85,6.18,generating graphics in higher in this
430.04,7.38,course we haven't deal much with this
434.03,5.96,applaud in summary we have seen how to
437.42,6.84,generate scatter plots line plots and
439.99,6.31,bar plots in the eye we have also seen
444.26,4.65,the challenges and disadvantages of
446.3,5.27,basic graphics and the need for using
448.91,6.18,the advanced packages such as ggplot2
451.57,6.97,for generating beautiful graphics in our
455.09,6.09,with this we end the our module for this
458.54,7.55,course wish you all the best for the
461.18,4.91,next modules in this course thank you
