the most basic division of a computer
system is between the hardware and the
software
hardware is often described as the
physical parts of a computer that you
can actually touch with your hands
although that is not recommended
especially when the power is on
software includes all the programmed
instructions in a computer
there is the main program called the
system software also known as the
operating system which controls and
interacts with the hardware and software
components
application software are programs like
photoshop internet explorer
and world of warcraft
the main hardware components include the
cpu or central processing unit
main memory
secondary storage devices
and the input and output devices
the cpu is a microchip that receives and
decodes instructions from memory
within the cpu are specialized units
one is the arithmetic logic unit
this part performs operations with
numbers
the control unit manages the flow of
instructions in time of the cpu clock
the faster the cpu clock the more
instructions that can be processed at a
time
the processor i have is a quad core
that means that there are four copies of
the same transistor circuitry within one
chip
with four cores my processor can execute
four times as many instructions at a
time than if it only had one core
the main memory is volatile
that means whatever data is held here
would be lost if the power went off
volatile memory needs a constant flow of
electricity to work so it's only used
for instructions in active use
otherwise data is stored in a permanent
storage device like the hard drive
the main memory can be imagined as a
sequence of cells that are either empty
or contain instructions or data
each cell has its own unique address
in the actual hardware electrical
signals
on and off
represent all computer information
these on and off signals are called bits
the hardware of a computer is like a
kitchen it includes all the equipment
necessary for cooking food as well as an
energy source and location for
performing the processes of cooking
the kitchen is where the ideas of a
recipe are translated into edible meals
a recipe is like software
a recipe is just a series of written
instructions that tell you how to turn
raw ingredients into a culinary
masterpiece
by itself a recipe is a useless piece of
writing but as soon as the recipe is
interpreted and executed the recipe has
value as a functional tool that can be
used again and again to produce the same
result
software is reusable the instructions of
software control the flow of data
you
