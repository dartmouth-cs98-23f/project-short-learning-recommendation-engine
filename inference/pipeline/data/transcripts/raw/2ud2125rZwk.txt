6.24,5.04,"Hello everyone! Welcome to the presentation 
on Player-AI interaction: What Neural Network  "
11.28,6.32,"Games Reveal About AI as Play. My name is Jennifer 
Villareale, a Ph.D. student at Drexel University."
18.24,5.36,"Literature on human-AI interaction is among one 
of the fastest-growing fields in the kai community  "
23.6,4.72,"with few exceptions most recent literature 
focuses on productivity-related domains."
29.36,3.36,"However, one overlooked 
area is the context of play  "
32.72,4.56,"the history of AI has long been associated 
with games video games have often been the  "
37.28,5.68,"testbed to try new AI algorithms and use 
the user interaction they afford. Therefore  "
42.96,4.88,"games offer a rich domain to understand and 
explore new ideas in human ai interaction"
49.44,3.44,"In this work, we study the interaction 
in neural network based game.  "
54.24,6.24,"We propose the new research area of player ai 
interaction in our paper we showcase how the  "
60.48,4.56,"concept of play can expand the current 
discussions around human ai interaction  "
65.04,3.44,"and point out new opportunities 
for ai infused products in general."
69.68,3.44,"We chose to use neural network games 
because they provide insights into  "
73.12,3.84,"some of the most pressing open 
problems in human ai interaction  "
76.96,2.96,"such as the low interpretability 
of the machine learning models."
80.48,4.24,"These are the methods we used. Through the 
first systematic review in this domain we  "
84.72,4.72,"collected a data set of 38 games wherein players 
can interact with the neural network as part of  "
89.44,6.0,"the core gameplay loop. Then using this data set 
we used grounded theory to develop a framework  "
95.44,4.8,"for how players interact with the neural networks 
and how much its existence is foregrounded in the  "
100.24,6.8,"user interface. tTo compare player ai interaction 
to the broader discussion and other ai products  "
107.04,5.68,"we also adapted existing guidelines for human ai 
interaction and used them to evaluate our games."
113.92,4.88,"Our analysis found four interaction metaphors 
that provide familiar structures for players to  "
118.8,7.28,"interact with the AI: apprentice, competitor, 
designer, and teammate. For example, the game  "
126.08,6.64,"AIvolution uses NN as Teammate metaphor where the 
player interacts with the NN as a colleague. The  "
132.72,3.2,"focus of the gameplay is a collaborative cycle 
between the player and the NN where they work  "
135.92,4.56,"together toward a shared goal. Players are able to 
build hilarious looking neural network creatures  "
140.48,4.48,"and they're able to construct their brain and 
avatar structure in order to train them to compete  "
144.96,5.04,"in a race. This is a new kind of interaction 
we typically don't see outside of games yet  "
150.0,4.64,"playful interaction that motivates players 
to try different kinds of ai configurations."
155.44,3.12,"We also found that there is a 
range of how much games highlight  "
158.56,2.4,"the use of neural networks 
in their user interface."
162.32,4.48,"This visualization represents the 
design space of player ai interaction  "
166.8,5.76,"based on these three dimensions. Each dot on 
this outer ring represents one of the 38 games.  "
172.56,3.04,"This diagram helps us 
identify under explore areas.  "
176.64,3.84,"For example we noticed that all games 
that adopted neural network as apprentice  "
180.48,6.32,"interaction used online learning for player agency 
such that the player may play with or control the  "
186.8,5.12,"training of the neural network. This interaction 
leads to a variety of neural network behaviors  "
191.92,4.64,"whereas most other metaphors use offline 
learning for more predictable player experience."
197.6,5.04,"We compare the compliance with these guidelines 
across the characteristics of our framework most  "
202.64,5.12,"notably we found that neural network as apprentice 
games comply well with the guidelines particularly  "
207.76,5.36,"with regards to providing global controls to the 
user and learning actively from the user behavior.  "
214.32,4.32,"For games where neural network is represented 
as a competitor the compliance with the design  "
218.64,4.96,"guidelines are very low because the guidelines 
are not created for the cases where ai is an  "
223.6,6.08,"adversary. However, an increasing number of ai 
infused products would fall into this category."
229.68,4.88,"We also compared the design guideline compliance 
of neural network games with reported outcomes of  "
234.56,5.68,"ai infused products by Amershi et al. to see 
what key similarities and differences exist.  "
241.36,4.24,"We find that like other ai infused products 
neural network games struggle to make the  "
245.6,4.8,"limitations of the ai known to the user 
during the initial interaction however  "
250.4,3.92,"games do this intentionally as the point 
is to learn the limitations through play.  "
255.36,4.32,"Neural network games generally perform better 
in enabling the user to provide feedback  "
259.68,5.28,"indicating their preferences during regular 
interaction they are also better in allowing  "
264.96,4.24,"the user to globally customize what the 
ai system monitors and how it behaves."
271.12,5.2,"For game designers ux designers and hci 
researchers interested in human ai interaction  "
276.32,5.84,"one of our key takeaways is that reframing 
ai is play offers a useful design approach  "
282.16,6.4,"ais play can offer a new design space where users 
can tinker, explore, and experiment with AI.  "
288.56,3.92,"With that we would like to thank 
NSF and DFF for supporting this work  "
292.48,4.4,"and the anonymous reviewers for providing their 
comments. Thank you for joining our presentation  "
296.88,2.96,"if you have any comments feel free 
to reach out via twitter or email."
