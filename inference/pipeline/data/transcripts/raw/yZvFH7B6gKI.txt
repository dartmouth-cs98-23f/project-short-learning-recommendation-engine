166.48,4.64,"Step three let's dive into what a data 
analyst actually does on a day-to-day basis  "
171.12,3.92,"if you're thinking about becoming a data analyst

175.04,5.04,"responsibilities that you'll have in the field

224.96,5.04,"strategies so those are just some examples of what 
a data analyst would be doing in any given role  "
230.0,3.68,"to learn more about the kinds of things that 
you'll be undertaking as a data analyst why  "
233.68,5.92,"not search on job boards like linkedin indeed 
and icrunchdata.com so that was step three  "
239.6,3.68,"it was just a broad overview of what you 
can expect to be doing as a data analyst"
247.44,4.08,"So now we've looked at data analytics as a role 
we're now going to go into the process of data  "
251.52,3.84,"analysis so now we're going to outline 
the five main steps a data analyst would  "
255.36,5.04,"take when approaching a new project step one 
define the questions that you want to answer  "
260.4,4.56,"you need to answer why you're conducting this 
analysis and what questions and answers you  "
264.96,5.2,"need to find at this stage you'll take a clearly 
defined problem and then you'll make a hypothesis  "
270.16,4.16,"or research question that you can go on and 
answer you'll then need to identify what types  "
274.32,4.56,"of data you'll need but importantly where it 
will come from for instance a business problem  "
278.88,5.68,"might be that customers aren't subscribing to 
a paid membership once that free trial ends  "
284.56,4.24,"your key question can then be what kind 
of strategies can the business implement  "
288.8,5.44,"to retain their customer base step two would be 
to collect this data with a clear question in mind  "
294.24,4.96,"you're ready to start collecting that data data 
analysts will usually gather data from primary  "
299.2,5.84,"sources or internal data that the company already 
has such as CRM software or email marketing tools  "
305.04,5.92,"they may tend to secondary or external sources 
such as open data sources so this can include  "
310.96,4.8,"data from government portals tools like 
google trends but also data from international  "
315.76,6.0,"organizations like the world health organization 
so step three you need to clean scrub that data  "
321.76,5.36,"once you've got that data you need to prepare 
it and ready it for analysis your original data  "
327.12,5.28,"might include duplicates anomalies or missing data 
which could distort how the data is interpreted  "
332.4,5.92,"these all need to be removed data cleaning can be 
a manual task and it can take some time but it's  "
338.32,5.04,"crucial if you want to get the right business 
insights step four is to analyze the data now  "
343.36,5.12,"for the actual analysis how you analyze the data 
will depend on the question that you're asking  "
348.48,3.6,"and the kind of data that you're working 
with but some common techniques include  "
352.08,5.44,"regression analysis cluster analysis and time 
series analysis to name just a few we're going to  "
357.52,4.48,"go into these analysis terms much deeper in future 
videos but if you have any specific questions now  "
362.0,4.88,"drop us a comment in the comments below moving 
on to step 5 we need to interpret and share the  "
366.88,5.84,"results the final step in this process is where 
data is turned into valuable business insights  "
372.72,4.56,"depending on the type of analysis conducted you'll 
present your findings in a way that others can  "
377.28,5.12,"understand in the form of a chart or a graph for 
example at this stage you'll be able to say what  "
382.4,5.36,"the data analysis actually shows you in regards 
to your initial question or business challenge  "
387.76,4.32,"and you'll collaborate with key stakeholders 
on how to move forward this is a great moment  "
392.08,5.2,"to reflect and look at the limitations of your 
data and what further analysis might be conducted  "

as python oracle and sql data analysts rely on  "

their work this may seem daunting at first but  "
437.84,4.8,"it's nothing that can't be learned over time with 
practice you'll also need an analytical mindset  "
