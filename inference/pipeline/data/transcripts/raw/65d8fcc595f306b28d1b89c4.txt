simply learn welcomes you to
machine learning versus deep learning
versus artificial intelligence some of
the most exciting technologies evolving
in today's world
my name is richard kirschner and i'll be
hosting this talk or simply learn
before we start covering the basics of
these three topics and how they connect
and how they are different let's just
look at a few examples so we get an
understanding of what's going on
here's an example of artificial
intelligence in today's world amazon
echo
amazon echo is a wonderful tool we can
go in there and you can say hey alexa
what's the temperature in chicago
and the amazon echo then translates that
into zeros and ones and something the
computer understands
then it comes in and processes that
information to identify what you're
asking and what you need and where to
get that information and then it comes
back and says the current temperature in
chicago is six degrees fahrenheit or
whatever it is at the moment
so this is a wonderful example of
artificial intelligence that we're using
right now today where that's at as far
as a commercial deployment
machine learning a machine learning
example out there is google you're on
your google search engine it comes up
you spend a lot of time on the first
link you come into and you read the page
and
google looks at that and says okay he
spent five minutes on this let's give it
a thumbs up
and then you go to the second page and
the third page you just kind of skip
over them and glance at them for a
couple seconds and google says i wasn't
interested in those pages let's give
them a thumbs down
so this is a good example of machine
learning as it starts guessing what you
like and what you don't like so it gives
you more information along what you're
going to read and actually use
and then we have an example of deep
learning
in this example we have a black and
white image
it comes into in this case a neural
network
some people like to call it a magic box
because you really it's hard to follow
all that's going on in there there's all
these different weights and connections
and nodes
and then it comes out
and colors the beach ball the people the
background
what's going on in here is the black and
white image goes into this neural
network and before it's ever gone in
the neural network has looked at all
these different pictures on the web or
wherever it pulls the data from
and it's already itemized them and kind
of separated them that
we have some that look like beach balls
we have some that look like people and
it programs that so that when the black
and white image comes in it goes okay
that piece right there
resembles this and all these other
photos
and the network is able to identify that
and then color the beach ball with the
colors that you see on there so it gives
it this is really wonderful because they
did a wonderful job coloring this
picture
and that's the full setup is where the
deep learning example comes in and they
usually center around neural networks
so we looked at a few examples what's in
it for you
first we're going to talk about human
versus artificial intelligence
this is very important because
this is our marker we as humans are
amazing and so we want to understand how
artificial intelligence compares
and what it does that it can accelerate
above humans and how it can integrate
with the human experience
what is machine learning and deep
learning all about are they really all
that different
we'll have a few more examples in here
and then we'll talk a little bit about
types of ai and machine learning and
comparing machine learning in deep
learning and finally a glimpse into the
future
human versus artificial intelligence
humans are amazing let's just face it
we're amazing creatures we're all over
the planet we're exploring
every nic chinook we've gone to the moon
we've gone into outer space we're just
amazing creatures
we're able to use the available
information to make decisions
to communicate with other people
identify patterns and data remember what
people have said adapt to new situations
so let's take a look at this so we so
you can get a picture you're a human
being so you know it's like to be human
let's take a look at artificial
intelligence versus the human artificial
intelligence develops computer systems
that can accomplish texts that require
human intelligence
so we're looking at this
one of the things that computers can do
they can provide more accurate results
this is very important
recently i did a project on
cancer whereas identifying markers
and as a human being you look at that
and you might be looking at all the
different images and the data that comes
off of them and say i like this person
so i want to give them a very good
outlook and the next person you might
not like so you want to give him a bad
outlook well with artificial
intelligence you're going to get a
consistent prediction of what's going to
come out interacts with humans using
their natural language we've seen that
as probably the biggest development
feature right now that's in the
commercial market that everybody gets to
use as we saw with the example of alexa
they learn from their mistakes and adapt
to new environments so we see this
slowly coming in more and more and they
learn from the data and automate
repetitive learning
repetitive learning has a lot to do with
the neural networks you have to program
thousands upon thousands of pictures in
there and it's all automated so as
today's computers evolve it's very quick
and easy and affordable to do this
what is machine learning and deep
learning all about
imagine this say you had some time to
waste not that any of us really have a
lot of time anymore to just waste in
today's world
and you're sitting by the road and you
have a whole lot of and a whole lot of
time passes by there's a few hours
and suddenly you wonder
how many cars buses trucks and so on
passed by in the six hours
now chances are you're not going to sit
by the road for six hours and count
buses cars and trucks unless you're
working for the city and you're trying
to do city planning and you want to know
hey do we need to add a new truck route
maybe we need a bicycle length we have a
lot of bicyclists here that kind of
thing so maybe city planning would be
great for this
machine learning well the way machine
learning works is we
have labeled data with features
okay so you have a truck or a car a
motorcycle a bus or a bicycle and each
one of those are labeled
it comes in and based on those labels
and comparing those features it gives
you an answer it's a bicycle it's a
truck it's a motorcycle this is a little
bit more in depth on this
and the model here it actually the
features we're looking at would be like
the tires someone sits there and figures
out what a tire looks like it takes a
lot of work if you try to try to figure
the difference between a car tire a
bicycle tire a motorcycle tire
so in the machine learning field this
could take a long time if you're going
to do each individual
aspect of a car
and try to get a result on there and
that's what they did do that was a very
this is still used on smaller amounts of
data where you figure out what those
features are and then you label them
deep learning so with deep learning
one of our solutions is to take a very
large unlabeled data set
and we put that into a training model
using artificial neural networks and
then that goes into the neural network
itself when we create a neural network
and you'll see the arrows are actually
kind of backward but which actually is a
nice point because when we train the
neural network
we put the bicycle in and then it comes
back and says if it's a truck it comes
back and says well you need to change
that to bicycle and then it changes all
those weights going backward they call
it back propagation
and let it know it's a bicycle and
that's how it learns
once you've trained the neural network
you then put the new data in and they
call this testing the model so you need
to have some data you've kept off to the
side where you know the answer to
and you take that and you provide the
required output and you say okay is this
is this neural network working correctly
did it identify a bike as a bike a truck
as a truck a motorcycle as a motorcycle
let's just take a little closer look at
that
determining what objects are present in
the data so how does deep learning do
this and here we have the image of the
bike
it's 28 by 28 pixels that's a lot of
information there could you imagine
trying to guess that this is a bicycle
image by looking at each one of those
pixels and trying to figure out what's
around it
and we actually do that as human beings
it's pretty amazing we know what a
bicycle is and even though it comes in
as all this information
and what this looks like is the image
comes in
it converts it into a bunch of different
nodes in this case there's a lot more
than what they show here and it goes
through these different layers and out
comes and says okay this is a bicycle
a lot of times they call this the magic
black box why because as we watch it go
across here
all these weights
and all the math behind this and it's
not it's a little complicated on the
math side you really don't need to know
that when you're programming or doing
working with the deep learning but it's
like magic you don't know you really
can't figure out what's going to come
out by looking what's in each one of
those dots and each one of those lines
are firing and what's going in between
them so we like to call it the magic box
uh so that's where deep learning comes
in
and in the end it comes up and you have
this whole neural network comes up and
says okay we fire all these different
pixels and we connects all these
different dots and gives them different
weights and says okay this is a bicycle
and that's how we determine what the
object is present in the data with deep
learning
machine learning we're going to take a
step into machine learning here and
you'll see how these fit together in a
minute the system is able to make
predictions or take decisions based on
past data that's very important for
machine learning is that we're
looking at stuff and based on what's
been there before
we're creating a decision on there we're
creating something out of there we're
coloring a beach ball we're telling you
what the weather is
in chicago
what's nice about machine learning is a
very powerful processing capability it's
quick and accurate outcomes
so you get results right away once you
program the system the results are very
fast
and the decisions and predictions are
better they're more accurate they're
consistent you can analyze very large
amounts of data
some of these data things that they're
analyzing now are petabytes and
terabytes of data it would take
hundreds of people
hundreds of years to go through some of
this data and do the same thing that the
machine learning can do in a very short
period of time and it's inexpensive
compared to hiring hundreds of people so
it becomes a very affordable way to move
into the future is to apply the machine
learning
to whatever businesses you're working on
and deep learning systems think and
learn like humans using artificial
neural networks again it's like a magic
box performance improves with more data
so the more data the deep learning gets
the more it gives you better results
it's scalability so you can scale it up
you can scale it down you can increase
what you're looking at
currently you know we're limited by the
amount of computer processing power as
to how big that can get but that
envelope continually gets pushed every
day on what it can do
problem solved in an end-to-end method
so instead of having to break it apart
and you have the first piece coming in
and you identify tires and the second
piece is identifying
labeling handlebars and then you bring
that together that if it has handlebars
and tires it's a bicycle and if it has
something that looks like a large square
it's probably a truck the neural
networks does this all in one network
you don't really know what's going on in
all those weights and all those little
bubbles
but it does it pretty much
in one package that's why the neural
network systems are so big nowadays and
coming into their own
best features are selected by the system
and it this is important they kind of
put it it's on a bullet on the side here
it's a subset of machine learning this
is important
we talk about deep learning it is a form
of machine learning there's lots of
other forms of machine learning data
analysis but this is the newest and
biggest thing that they apply to a lot
of different packages and they use all
the other machine learning tools
available to work with it and it's very
fast to test
you put in your information
you then have your group of tests
and then you held some aside you see how
does it do it's very quick to test it
and see what's going on with your deep
learning in your neural network
are they really all that different
ai versus machine learning versus deep
learning
concepts of ai
so we have concepts of iii you'll see
natural language processing
machine learning an approach to create
artificial intelligence so it's one of
the subsets of artificial intelligence
knowledge representation automated
reasoning computer vision
robotics
machine learning versus ai versus deep
learning or ai and machine learning and
deep learning
so we look at this we have ai with
machine learning and deep learning and
so we're going to put them all together
we find out that ai is the big picture
we have a collection of books
it goes through some deep learning
the digital data is analyzed text mining
comes through
the particular book you're looking for
maybe it's a genre books is identified
and in this case we have a robot that
goes and gives a book to the patron i
have yet to be at a library that has a
robot bring me a book but that will be
cool when it happens
as we look at some of the pieces here
this information goes into
there's as far as this example
the translation of the handwritten
printed data to digital form
that's pretty hard to do that's pretty
hard to go in there and translate
hundreds and hundreds of books
and understand what they're trying to
say if you've never read them so in this
case we use the deep learning because
you can already use examples where
they've already classified a lot of
books and then they can compare those
texts and say oh okay this is a book on
automotive repair this is a book on
robotic building the digital data is in
analyzed then we have more text mining
using machine learning so maybe we'd use
a different program to do a basic
classify
what you're looking for and say oh
you're looking for
auto repair and computers so you're
looking for automated cars once it's
identified then of course it brings you
the book
so here's a nice summation of what we
were just talking about ai with machine
learning and deep learning deep learning
is a subset of machine learning which is
a subset of artificial intelligence so
you can look at artificial intelligence
as the big picture how does this compare
to the human experience
in either doing the same thing as a
human we do or it
does it better than us and machine
learning which has a lot of tools
uh is something that learns from data
past experiences it's programmed it's uh
comes in there and it says hey we
already had these five things happen the
sixth one should be about the same and
then there's a lot of tools in machine
learning but deep learning then is a
very specific tool in machine learning
it's the artificial neural network which
handles large amounts of data and is
able to take huge pools
of experiences pictures and ideas and
bring them together
real life examples
artificial intelligence news generation
very common nowadays as it goes through
there and finds the news articles or
generates the news based upon the news
feeds
or the back end coming in and says okay
let's give you the actual news based on
this there's all the different things
amazon echo they have a number of
different prime music on there of course
there's also the
google command and there's also
cortana there's tons of smart home
devices now where we can ask it to turn
the tv on or play music for us that's
all artificial intelligence from front
to back
you're having a human experience
with these computers and these
objects that are connected to the
processing machine learning
spam detection very common machine
learning doesn't really have the human
interaction part
so this is the part where it goes and
says okay that's a spam that's not a
spam and it puts it in your spam folder
search engine result refining
another example of of
machine learning whereas it looks at
your different results and it go and it
is able to categorize them as far as it
said the most hits this is the least
viewed this has five stars you know
however they want to weight it
all exactly good examples of machine
learning and then the deep learning uh
deep learning another example is
as you have like a exit sign
in this case is translating it into
french
sorti i hope i said that right
neural network has been programmed with
all these different words and images and
so it's able to look at the exit in the
middle and it goes okay we want to know
what that is in french and it's able to
push that out in france french
and learn how to do that
and then we have chat bots
i remember when microsoft first had
their little paper clip um boy that was
like a long time ago they came up and
you would type in there and chat with it
these are growing you know it's nice to
just be able to ask a question and it
comes up and gives you the answer
and instead of it being were you just
doing a search on certain words it's now
able to start linking those words
together and form a sentence in that
chat box
types of ai and machine learning
types of artificial intelligence this in
the next few slides are really important
so one of the types of artificial
intelligence is reactive machines
systems that only react they don't form
memories they don't have past
experiences they have something that
happens to them and they react to it
my washing machine is one of those
if i put a ton of clothes in it and it
all clumped on one side
it automatically adds a weight to
recenter it so that my washing machine
is actually a reactive machine working
with whatever the load is and keeps it
nice and so when it spins it doesn't go
thumping against the side
limited memory another form of
artificial intelligence
systems look into the past
information is added over a period of
time and information is short-lived when
we're talking about this and you look at
like a neural network that's been
programmed to identify cars
it doesn't remember all those pictures
it has no memory as far as the hundreds
of pictures you process through it all
it has is this is the pattern i use to
identify cars as the final output for
that neural network we looked at
so when they talk about limited memory
this is what they're talking about
they're talking about i've created this
based on all these things but i'm not
going to remember anyone specifically
theory of mind systems being able to
understand human emotions and how they
affect decision making to adjust their
behaviors according to their human
understanding
this is important because this is our
page mark this is how we know
whether it is an artificial intelligence
or not
is it interacting with humans in a way
that we can understand
without that interaction
is just an object so we talk about
theory of mind we really understand how
it interfaces that whole if you're in
web development user experience would be
the term i would put in there so the
theory of mine would be user experience
how's the whole ui connected together
and one of the final things is as we get
into artificial intelligence is systems
being aware of themselves
understanding their internal states and
predicting other people's feelings and
act appropriately so as artificial
intelligence continues to progress
we see ones that are trying to
understand what makes people happy how
would they increase our happiness
how would they keep themselves from
breaking down if something's broken
inside they have that self-awareness to
be able to fix it and just based on all
that information predicting which action
would work the best what would help
people
if i know that you're having a cup of
coffee first thing in the morning is
what makes you happy as a robot i might
make you a cup of coffee every morning
at the same time
to help your life and help you grow
that'd be the self-awareness is being
able to know all those different things
types of machine learning and like i
said on the last slide this is very
important this is very important if you
decide to go in and get certified in
machine learning or know more about it
these are the three primary types of
machine learning
the first one is supervised learning
systems are able to predict future
outcome based on past data requires both
an input and an output to be given to
the model for it to be trained
so in this case we're looking at
anything where you have 100 images of a
bicycle
and those hundred images you know are
bicycle so it's their presets someone
already looked at all hundred images and
said these are pictures of bicycles and
so the computer learns from those and
then it's given another picture
and maybe the next picture is a bicycle
and it says oh that resembles all these
other bicycles so it's a bicycle and the
next one's a car and it says that's not
a bicycle
that would be supervised learning
because we had to train it we had to
supervise it unsupervised learning
systems are able to identify hidden
patterns from the input data provided
by making the data more readable and
organized the patterns similarities or
anomalies become more evident you'll
heard the term cluster how do you
cluster things together some of these
things go together some of these don't
this is unsupervised where you can look
at an image
and start pulling the different pieces
of the image out
because they aren't the same the human
all the parts of the human are not the
same as a fuzzy tree behind them just
slightly out of focus which is not the
same as the beach ball it's unsupervised
because we never told it what a beach
ball was we never told them what the
human was and we never told it that
those were trees
all we told it was hey separate this
picture by things that don't match
and things that do match and come
together
and finally there's reinforcement
learning systems are given no training
it learns on the basis of the reward
punishment it received for performing
its last action it helps increase the
efficiency of a tool function or a
program reinforced learning a
reinforcement learning is kind of you
give it a yes or no yes you give me the
right response no you didn't and then it
looks at that and says oh okay so based
on this data coming in
what i gave you was a wrong response so
next time i'll give you a different one
comparing machine learning and deep
learning so remember that deep learning
is a subcategory of machine learning so
it's one of the many tools
and so they were grouping a ton of
machine learning tools all together
linear regression k means clustering
there's all kinds of cool tools out
there you can use in machine learning
enables machines to take decisions to
make decisions on their own based on
past data
enables machines to make decisions with
the help of artificial neural networks
so it's doing the same thing but we're
using an artificial neural network as
opposed to one of the more traditional
machine learning tools
needs only a small amount of training
data this is very important when you're
talking about machine learning
they're usually not talking about huge
amounts of data we're talking about
maybe your spreadsheet from your
business and your totals for the end of
the year when you're talking about
neural networks you usually need a large
amount of data to train the data so
there's a lot of training involved if
you have under 500 points of data that's
probably
not going to go into machine learning or
maybe you have like the case of one of
the things 500 points of data and 30
different fields it starts getting
really confusing there in artificial
intelligence or machine learning and the
deep learning aspect really shines when
you get to that larger data that's
really complex
works well on a low end systems
so a lot of the machine learning tools
out there you can run on your laptop
with no problem and do the calculations
there
where with the machine learning usually
needs a higher end system to work it
takes a lot more processing power to
build those neural networks and to train
them it goes through a lot of data
we're talking about the general machine
learning tools most features need to be
identified in advanced and manually
coded so there's a lot of human work on
here the machine learns the features
from the data it is provided so again
it's like a magic box you don't have to
know what a tire is
it figures it out for you
the problem is divided into parts and
solved individually and then combined so
machine learning you usually have all
these different tools and use different
tools for different parts
and the problem is solved in an
end-to-end manner so you only have one
neural network or two neural networks
that is bringing the data in and putting
it out it's not going through a lot of
different processes to get there and
remember you can put machine learning
and deep learning together so you don't
always have just the deep learning
solving the problem by having selling
one piece of the puzzle
with regular machine learning and most
machine learning tools out there they
take longer to test and understand how
they work
and with the deep learning it's pretty
quick once you build that neural network
you test it and you know
so we're dealing with very crisp rules
limited resources
you have to really explain how the
decision was made when you use most
machine learning tools but when you use
the deep learning tool inside the
machine learning tools
the system takes care of it based on its
own logic and reasoning and again it's
like a magic black box
you really don't know how it came up
with the answer you just know it came up
with the right answer
a glimpse into the future
so a quick glimpse into the future
artificial intelligence using it to
detecting crimes before they happen
humanoid ai helpers which we already
have a lot of there'll be more and more
maybe it'll actually be androids that'd
be cool to have an android that comes
and gets stuff out of my fridge for me
machine learning increasing efficiency
in healthcare that's really big in all
the forms of machine learning better
marketing techniques
any of these things
if we get into the sciences it's just
off the scale machine learning and
artificial intelligence go everywhere
and then the subcategory deep learning
increased
personalization so what's really nice
about the deep learning is it's going to
start now catering to you that'll be one
of the things we see more and more of
and we'll have more of a hyper
intelligent personal assistant i'm
excited about that
what we have learned
so far we covered artificial
intelligence
in this case the
ai versus the human we did a lot of that
so we have a page marker of human
interaction
we discussed machine learning and all
their different parts and then we
discussed the deep learning aspect
we went into ai and machine learning and
deep learning
how they're all sub-categories of each
other very important to remember that
artificial intelligence is a big picture
machine learning is a category in
artificial intelligence and then deep
learning is a tool in machine learning
we talked of all the aspects in the
machine learning and deep learning and
how they compare and we took a quick
glimpse into the future and all the
different i'm sure you can come up with
many more examples of where it's coming
out in our future we looked at a few of
them so you have some ideas of where
this is going and all the different
wonderful opportunities are going to
come out with it
