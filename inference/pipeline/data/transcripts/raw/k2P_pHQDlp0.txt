0.0,2.909,hello all my name is Krishna and welcome
1.68,3.3,to my youtube channel today in this
2.909,4.081,particular video we'll be discussing the
4.98,4.02,most fundamental thing in data science
6.99,3.93,like what is the difference between
9.0,6.15,artificial intelligence machine learning
10.92,6.06,deep learning and data science I'm just
15.15,4.74,going to write it as des that is data
16.98,5.01,science nowadays I probably think in my
19.89,4.799,You Tube video I had to upload this
21.99,4.89,particular video as first but you know I
24.689,4.08,just went with the flow I miss about
26.88,4.049,this particular topic because many of
28.769,4.231,you still have various confusion
30.929,4.351,regarding it so in this particular video
33.0,4.23,I'm going to clear a confusion and I'm
35.28,3.75,going to tell you what exactly is
37.23,3.419,artificial intelligence what exactly is
39.03,4.049,machine learning what exactly is deep
40.649,3.84,learning and how do we use data science
43.079,3.901,considering all this particular
44.489,4.381,technology and work so let us go ahead
46.98,3.96,and let us just think I'm also going to
48.87,4.68,create some Venn diagrams so let me
50.94,5.91,consider that this is my Venn diagram of
53.55,5.189,AI and the main work of AI you have
56.85,5.459,heard of AI applications you have heard
58.739,8.401,of a engineer slow kind of positions so
62.309,7.56,AI basically helps us to it enables the
67.14,9.24,computer or machine it enables the
69.869,8.341,machine to think it enables the machine
76.38,4.77,to think that basically means without
78.21,5.04,any human intervention the machine will
81.15,4.77,be able to take its own decision
83.25,4.59,and always remember guys whatever I am
85.92,5.489,talking about over here with respect to
87.84,6.239,AI right this is the final goal you are
91.409,4.681,basically creating an AI application a
94.079,5.551,self-driving car that is an AI
96.09,4.709,application app which actually uses
99.63,2.82,machine learning and deep learning
100.799,4.771,within them is basically an AI
102.45,5.73,application it does some kind of task so
105.57,4.619,finally this is my final goal I have to
108.18,4.11,reach over here and create an AI app
110.189,4.561,okay now when I talk about machine
112.29,6.869,learning machine learning is a subset of
114.75,6.42,AI okay so machine learning is a subset
119.159,6.631,of AI and what does machine learning
121.17,10.56,help us to do it provides us statistical
125.79,7.15,tools statistical tools to explore the
131.73,4.75,data
132.94,6.15,to explore the data simple definition
136.48,5.91,guys it provides us some statistical
139.09,5.37,tools to explore and understand about
142.39,4.08,that particular data now when I talk
144.46,3.48,about machine learning in machine
146.47,4.68,learning you have three different
147.94,5.73,approaches one is supervised machine
151.15,5.01,learning I'll also discuss about what
153.67,3.86,exactly supervised okay so the second
156.16,5.52,technique is something called as
157.53,6.48,unsupervised machine learning the third
161.68,6.75,technique is something called as
164.01,7.5,reinforcement reinforcement learning or
168.43,6.12,this is also called as semi-supervised
171.51,8.92,machine learning okay I can write it as
174.55,8.16,semi-supervised so this techniques of
180.43,3.9,machine learning is basically ranging in
182.71,4.83,this let me give you a very good example
184.33,5.88,of supervised so in case of supervised
187.54,5.13,we'll be having some label data you know
190.21,4.23,some passed data and with the help of
192.67,4.47,this kind of data we'll be actually able
194.44,4.62,to do the prediction for the future let
197.14,4.65,me just take a very good example suppose
199.06,6.72,based on I have two features in my data
201.79,5.67,set like age I have I have not age let
205.78,4.08,me just consider that I have height and
207.46,4.77,weight as my two features and I want to
209.86,4.35,classify whether that person will is
212.23,3.99,belonging to an obese category or
214.21,4.41,whether it belongs to the fit category
216.22,4.47,right so this kind of data initially
218.62,3.62,whenever I'm making my model at that
220.69,4.32,time I'll have this day time and
222.24,5.14,previously only and what I will do I'll
225.01,3.96,create a model train on that data and
227.38,3.12,with the help of those kind of data I'll
228.97,3.81,be actually creating a supervised
230.5,5.01,machine learning model that basically
232.78,6.96,means in case of supervised we have
235.51,7.08,passed data passed labeled data okay we
239.74,4.62,know what will be the output of this
242.59,3.72,particular data now in the second
244.36,4.23,category when I talk about unsupervised
246.31,4.59,machine learning here I'll not be having
248.59,4.5,any labeled data that basically means in
250.9,4.2,my data set I will not know what is the
253.09,4.2,output so in unsupervised machine
255.1,4.83,learning we usually solve clustering
257.29,4.17,planet of problems clustering you know
259.93,2.85,there are different different clustering
261.46,4.27,techniques like k-means clustering
262.78,4.81,hydrocal min clusterings so in answer
265.73,4.41,machine learning we will actually be
267.59,4.83,solving clustering techniques and when I
270.14,4.92,say clustering what exactly it does is
272.42,4.5,that based on the similarity of that
275.06,4.44,data it will try to group that data
276.92,4.47,together and there is some mathematical
279.5,3.96,concepts like euclidean distance
281.39,4.44,actually used inside that width apart
283.46,3.9,weights or some other techniques also so
285.83,3.27,most probably here are two different
287.36,3.45,algorithms or three different decorative
289.1,4.32,algorithms one is k-means clustering
290.81,4.47,higher it'll mean clustering DB scan
293.42,3.54,clustering these are the three popular
295.28,4.08,clustering algorithms that we basically
296.96,4.29,used in unsupervised machine learning
299.36,4.17,now in case of reinforcement learning
301.25,4.44,what will happen is that some part of
303.53,3.57,your data will be labeled and later on
305.69,3.66,some part of the data will not be
307.1,4.71,labeled so the computer or the machine
309.35,4.53,learning model learn slowly by seeing
311.81,4.38,the past data and it will be learning as
313.88,4.5,soon as the new environment new new data
316.19,4.08,will be coming up so I hope you
318.38,3.6,understood this that is what we are
320.27,3.48,actually doing over here the most
321.98,4.2,important part is that we need to have
323.75,5.04,data it also it also provides some
326.18,5.82,statistical tools to analyze explore and
328.79,4.98,analyze the data okay and this is the
332.0,4.07,three different techniques that we
333.77,5.34,basically have in machine learning the
336.07,5.02,last the third part which is my deep
339.11,4.23,learning is again a subset of machine
341.09,5.1,learning now why did deep learning good
343.34,5.91,got created you know so what scientists
346.19,5.73,thought is that can we make the Machine
349.25,4.83,learn like how we with the help of human
351.92,4.89,brain actually try to learn things you
354.08,4.62,know that was a main idea behind deep
356.81,3.9,learning so over here in deep learning
358.7,4.88,you create architecture which is called
360.71,7.92,as multi neural network architecture
363.58,8.02,multi neural network architecture so at
368.63,4.59,the end of the day we are basically
371.6,4.38,using multi neural network architecture
373.22,5.46,and we are actually creating some deep
375.98,5.13,learning neural networks the main idea
378.68,5.28,behind deep learning is to mimic human
381.11,5.64,brain you know how human actually learns
383.96,4.92,those concepts similarly we are creating
386.75,4.08,models over here which is learning those
388.88,4.68,things and the most important thing is
390.83,5.01,multi neural network architecture right
393.56,4.22,and in deep learning also you have
395.84,3.89,various techniques one is
397.78,3.93,and that is artificial neural network
399.73,4.11,the second one is CNN that is
401.71,4.02,convolution neural network and the third
403.84,4.74,one is RNN which is called as a weaker
405.73,4.5,and neural network most of the problem
408.58,3.63,statements most of the data which is
410.23,4.89,actually present in the form of numbers
412.21,4.679,will be solved with the help of a NN you
415.12,4.41,know artificial neural network suppose
416.889,4.171,our input is in the form of images we
419.53,3.75,will basically use CN n that is
421.06,4.2,convolution neural network and suppose
423.28,4.08,if our input is in the form of tiny
425.26,4.409,series kind of data at that time we will
427.36,3.87,be using recurrent neural network apart
429.669,4.441,from this there are also techniques like
431.23,5.1,transfer learning you know there's some
434.11,5.28,advanced neural networks extension of
436.33,5.61,the CN n + 1 CN n so suppose if I take
439.39,5.1,an example of mass 2 r CN n right so
441.94,4.229,these are some advanced neural network
444.49,3.66,architecture which where the base is
446.169,4.051,actually a CN n architecture so you
448.15,4.41,should try to understand this first of
450.22,3.81,all I am actually using this concepts of
452.56,3.329,machine learning and deep learning and
454.03,4.59,the main goal is to derive an AI
455.889,4.171,application you know by using this
458.62,3.51,particular techniques I want to I want
460.06,3.9,to create a model which will be I want
462.13,3.66,to create a self-driving car so that is
463.96,3.33,self-driving track maybe in our AIII
465.79,3.51,application ok
467.29,4.56,now the question arises where does data
469.3,4.23,science fit into this right now data
471.85,4.98,science is a technique which try to
473.53,5.4,apply all this particular part means all
476.83,4.14,these techniques that is basically
478.93,3.87,machine learning deep learning now apart
480.97,4.58,from that it also uses some tools some
482.8,8.67,some some mathematical tools like
485.55,10.929,statistics you know probability linear
491.47,5.94,algebra linear algebra a whole lot of
496.479,3.211,different different maths like
497.41,4.8,differential calculus and all right and
499.69,4.95,that is what this is basically my TS
502.21,5.73,that is data science so a data scientist
504.64,5.1,will have to work on M LDL based on the
507.94,3.42,type of use case by using some
509.74,3.54,mathematical tools like statistics
511.36,4.5,probability linear algebra and many more
513.28,4.47,ok and he may work in this three kind of
515.86,3.51,machine learning he may work in this
517.75,4.08,three kind of deep learning techniques
519.37,4.32,right and this is the basic difference
521.83,4.59,between an AI AM L
523.69,4.74,Hanan data science you have whole lot of
526.42,4.32,these things that you basically learn
528.43,5.55,when you want to become a data scientist
530.74,4.59,isn't it amazing right because I have
533.98,4.23,actually walked in each and everything
535.33,4.08,each and every part of this all the
538.21,3.06,techniques that I have actually written
539.41,3.51,down over here I've created some very
541.27,3.06,good AI application some of the
542.92,2.88,recommendation system supercool
544.33,4.95,recommendation systems I have actually
545.8,5.25,created you know and if I go and use
549.28,3.36,this RNN I've actually worked on
551.05,4.08,time-series sales data with the help of
552.64,5.37,RN in architecture I have extensively
555.13,5.4,worked on CNN's you know where my inputs
558.01,4.05,are in the form of images live feeds you
560.53,4.26,know videos and all this particular
562.06,4.95,technique so yes this was all about this
564.79,4.89,particular video I hope you understood
567.01,3.87,this particular video that we discussed
569.68,3.93,that what is the basic difference
570.88,3.96,between a I am LDL data science please
573.61,2.94,do subscribe the channel if you have not
574.84,3.48,already subscribed and please share with
576.55,3.69,all your friends who ever require this
578.32,4.29,kind of help and yes I'll see y'all in
580.24,4.88,the next video have a great day thank
582.61,2.51,you one at all
