you a creative individual trying to
develop an application
whether you're writing some code editing
a video or making the 3d model
there are many factors you may want to
consider sometimes
when designing we focus too much on the
visuals
in such a way where we design for
ourselves
rather than the user putting your
personality into what you create
is great as long as it doesn't interfere
with the user's journey
if you're on a computer take a look at
your mouse and keyboard
think about how these tools evolved over
the years
what has stayed the same why do you own
this particular pair
because of their color or because you
like the way they feel
it could be both but one thing is for
sure
everybody wants to be comfortable
but what is comfort can you design
something comfortable
the answer is yes with a number of
methods
human computer interactions can help you
develop a more user-friendly interface
and application it's the study and
collection of data
based on human factors focusing on
designing
cognitively for the users
all the senses especially sound sight
and touch
need to be considered measurements of
users how they identify
ensuring that your application is
inclusive for various types of users
is imperative to creating a more
user-friendly
experience but how and when can you
implement
hci it may vary depending on the service
or product you're developing
in this case let's say you're developing
a website
if you're an experienced designer then
you can probably go ahead and start
coding
otherwise it can pay off to start doing
some research
see what websites are popular what are
users currently used to
what's the layout like the more familiar
your interface is
the more comfortable the user feels fun
fact
when a user interacts with an interface
that does not feel natural
the size of their pupils change
during your research you may notice that
for instance
bank sites all look alike it might be
worth looking into your industry
how does the leading brand have their
web designed
when you're done inserting content and
start adding colors
effects font families and font weights
it'll be important to do some research
on color blindness
and how users may perceive colors
differently
visual impairment is common and there
are ways to design
for this instance consider what colors
you use
when establishing important interactions
when you've got your site prepared
invite some participants to test your
product
or service survey them and see how you
can improve your design
when we design we typically have the
user's interest in mind
but it's important to know that the
user's interest is a part of the
development
itself
