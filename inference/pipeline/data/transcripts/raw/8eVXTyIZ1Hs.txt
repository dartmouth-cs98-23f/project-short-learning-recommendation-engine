0.179,4.261,Alex has just completed his graduation
2.58,4.259,from Stanford University
4.44,4.079,one fine day he receives a mail from
6.839,3.601,Star Trek Technologies for an interview
8.519,4.62,for the designation of a software
10.44,4.8,engineer as referred by the University
13.139,4.081,Alex was really happy and excited about
15.24,3.84,this and starts preparing for his
17.22,4.08,interview next week while he was
19.08,4.02,preparing Alex came across the term
21.3,5.219,downtime
23.1,5.22,Alex has no idea what is a downtime
26.519,4.08,he decided to seek help from his uncle
28.32,4.62,John a software engineer
30.599,4.381,John explained that downtime is a
32.94,4.139,specific time frame allocated to deploy
34.98,4.079,or update changes for a software product
37.079,3.601,in a real-time environment
39.059,3.721,and this happens because most of the
40.68,4.02,softwares we use today are developed
42.78,3.299,using the waterfall model
44.7,3.72,for example
46.079,4.921,Cisco one of the popular leaders in it
48.42,4.139,and networking globally is using agile
51.0,4.559,methodology for their subscription
52.559,4.801,billing platform SBP as it was
55.559,2.941,originally developed using the waterfall
57.36,3.44,model
58.5,4.62,after adopting the agile methodology
60.8,4.66,Cisco's product improved its overall
63.12,4.14,efficiency where defects were reduced by
65.46,4.56,40 percent compared to the previous
67.26,5.76,releases and effect removal efficiency
70.02,5.7,increased by 14 percent
73.02,4.8,upon explaining what downtime is John
75.72,3.899,further added that downtime is a small
77.82,3.78,part of the waterfall model
79.619,3.901,it is the traditional way of developing
81.6,4.08,softwares using a software development
83.52,4.38,life cycle where the whole product is
85.68,4.2,treated as one single unit and the
87.9,3.539,development of one phase starts only
89.88,4.14,after the completion of the previous
91.439,4.32,phase adding new features or updating
94.02,4.139,the existing feature in a waterfall
95.759,4.86,model based product needs a specific
98.159,3.901,time frame known as downtime to avoid
100.619,3.601,disturbance in the workflow of an
102.06,4.08,organization where applying changes in a
104.22,4.859,waterfall-based product might produce
106.14,5.4,irrelevant results or product failure
109.079,4.201,the waterfall model is the earliest or
111.54,3.359,the traditional model used for software
113.28,3.6,development where the output of one
114.899,4.381,phase acts as the input for the
116.88,5.279,preceding phase consisting of a series
119.28,4.92,of steps where each phase has specific
122.159,4.441,deliverables that act as the input for
124.2,5.339,the next phase as it avoids overlapping
126.6,3.96,a basis as these phases are dependent on
129.539,3.001,each other
130.56,4.02,this method is simple and easy to
132.54,4.199,understand where prerequisites are
134.58,4.32,pre-known documented earlier and
136.739,4.561,Technology remains static where there is
138.9,4.919,no need for ambiguous requirements due
141.3,4.5,to the delay in software delivery in
143.819,4.021,contrast the final version is available
145.8,4.38,only after completing the entire
147.84,4.14,software lifecycle process with any
150.18,3.9,deviations if available
151.98,4.44,changes in the waterfall model contain
154.08,4.379,high risk as changes include a new
156.42,4.5,revised version of the entire software
158.459,3.78,running the entire series of steps again
160.92,4.44,and again
162.239,4.981,for example a tap and pay machine where
165.36,3.3,the machine first validates whether the
167.22,3.659,customer's account is funded with
168.66,3.96,sufficient funds or not and then
170.879,4.08,initiates the transaction for money
172.62,4.44,transfer unless the validation is
174.959,3.36,processed the transaction cannot be
177.06,4.259,initiated
178.319,4.861,Alex was curious and asked Uncle John is
181.319,3.301,there any way to overcome the drawbacks
183.18,5.1,of the waterfall model
184.62,5.64,John replies yes agile methodology was
188.28,4.08,introduced to overcome the problems
190.26,4.08,faced in the waterfall model where agile
192.36,4.019,based products are developed by breaking
194.34,5.039,the entire product process into
196.379,5.341,microservices or phases which is faster
199.379,5.101,to execute and deploy changes on the go
201.72,4.86,there is no need to worry about other or
204.48,4.2,previous tasks while working on one
206.58,3.18,particular phase avoiding product
208.68,3.36,failure
209.76,4.979,agile based products don't require any
212.04,5.58,particular time frame downtime to deploy
214.739,4.741,changes unlike the waterfall model where
217.62,4.32,the whole product is treated as one
219.48,4.14,single unit and each process is
221.94,3.96,dependent on the preceding processes
223.62,4.44,where deploying changes leads to
225.9,4.68,downtime how agile products are
228.06,5.459,developed agile based products are
230.58,4.5,developed using the agile life cycle at
233.519,3.3,first the developed product is
235.08,3.719,implemented in an actual working
236.819,3.961,environment for reviews from clients and
238.799,3.481,stakeholders to check its deliverables
240.78,4.08,and functionality
242.28,4.26,after client reviews the official
244.86,3.78,product is launched in a real-time
246.54,4.44,working environment where agile
248.64,4.62,methodology focuses on satisfying the
250.98,4.38,consumer needs by efficiently utilizing
253.26,5.159,the resources and avoiding additional
255.36,5.7,risks or deviations in the product for
258.419,4.381,example providing a trial beta version
261.06,3.84,of the software for the end user to
262.8,4.26,experience the software towards its
264.9,3.66,deliverables and results will be helpful
267.06,4.62,in refining and reviewing the product
268.56,4.02,like Adobe Photoshop Adobe Illustrator
271.68,3.239,Etc
272.58,3.48,after understanding all about agile
274.919,3.961,methodology
276.06,4.5,Alex asks Uncle John for companies
278.88,2.819,implementing agile in their workspace
280.56,3.18,nowadays
281.699,3.901,John replies yes
283.74,4.26,companies are moving towards agile
285.6,5.159,methodology due to its flexibility and
288.0,4.32,advantages over traditional systems by
290.759,4.261,adopting agile for their Sony
292.32,4.02,interactive environment Sony noticed a
295.02,4.02,major difference where there was a
296.34,5.04,reduced planning Time by 28 with their
299.04,4.379,framework and downtime was reduced to
301.38,4.98,the maximum which made the company save
303.419,4.981,30 million dollars a year so here's a
306.36,5.1,question for you what makes agile
308.4,6.48,different from waterfall Model A it is
311.46,5.28,dependent on microservices B Agile
314.88,4.44,consumes more time
316.74,6.239,C the process is broken down into
319.32,5.7,several phases d none of the above
322.979,3.601,please give it a thought and post your
325.02,3.66,answers in the comments section below
326.58,3.959,three lucky winners will receive Amazon
328.68,4.079,gift vouchers
330.539,4.081,agile methodology aims to meet the
332.759,4.021,consumer's requirements to the maximum
334.62,4.5,in deploying changes in a rapidly
336.78,4.62,developing environment where agile
339.12,4.5,Manifesto principles brings an
341.4,4.2,Innovative set of rules and protocols to
343.62,3.66,help developers overcome the challenges
345.6,5.099,faced in the traditional practices
347.28,5.699,waterfall model making agile flexible
350.699,4.921,and efficient we hope you enjoyed this
