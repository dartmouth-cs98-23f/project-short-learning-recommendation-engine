9.36,2.8,what is going on guys welcome back in
10.8,3.52,today's we're going to talk about
12.16,3.12,three-dimensional plotting in matplotlib
14.32,2.719,which means we're going to make
15.28,3.919,visualizations in three dimensions
17.039,4.0,rather than only two dimensions and i
19.199,3.441,have made a video on this already on my
21.039,3.841,channel it's quite old it's part of the
22.64,4.0,data science tutorial series uh it's low
24.88,3.44,quality so i'm going to make a new video
26.64,4.24,here with more information with better
28.32,4.079,quality and better explanations so let's
30.88,4.4,get right into it we're going to start
32.399,5.84,by importing matplotlib
35.28,5.68,dot pi plot s plt
38.239,3.921,and we're going to also import numpy as
40.96,2.72,np
42.16,3.28,now we're going to use numpy mainly for
43.68,3.199,the generation of data we're not going
45.44,3.68,to plot actual data we're going to
46.879,4.0,generate data using numpy and we're
49.12,3.119,going to use obviously matplotlib for
50.879,4.081,the plotting now one thing that you
52.239,4.721,might want to or might have to import
54.96,4.32,i'm not sure sometimes i needed it
56.96,4.079,sometimes i don't need it now in the
59.28,3.279,last try i did need it so i don't know
61.039,3.44,if it's actually necessary but we're
62.559,4.721,going to import from
64.479,5.841,mpl underscore toolkits
67.28,4.8,we're going to import mplot3d now again
70.32,3.6,the syntax highlighting is going to show
72.08,4.079,that we're actually not using it and
73.92,4.0,sometimes if i remove it it works
76.159,4.32,sometimes it says okay i don't know the
77.92,4.08,projection 3d and it doesn't work so for
80.479,3.761,some reason
82.0,3.92,i'm not sure if we need that or not but
84.24,3.12,if you want to make sure that it works
85.92,3.199,then you want to import this as well
87.36,3.36,it's part of matplotlid and of course as
89.119,3.441,always if you don't have
90.72,4.24,matplotlib installed then you're going
92.56,6.559,to say pip install
94.96,5.839,matplotlib and numpy like that
99.119,2.881,all right so those are the imports and
100.799,3.521,the first thing we're going to do is
102.0,5.28,we're going to talk about plotting
104.32,4.56,single three-dimensional points in order
107.28,3.76,to do that obviously we just have to
108.88,3.44,specify coordinates but before we can
111.04,3.84,actually start plotting in three
112.32,4.64,dimensions we need to create an axis
114.88,3.44,and this axis has to have a 3d
116.96,4.4,projection now we have different
118.32,5.2,projections we don't have only uh 3d
121.36,4.24,there is in the map of the documentation
123.52,4.08,i think a large list of different
125.6,3.76,projections that we can use
127.6,4.639,but if you want to create a new axis you
129.36,3.959,basically say ax or whatever you want
132.239,4.72,equals
133.319,5.961,plt.axis and then the projection
136.959,3.92,in this case is going to be 3d now the
139.28,3.44,projection
140.879,3.681,is basically the type of coordinate
142.72,3.28,system you have the basic default which
144.56,3.12,is the two dimensions we have
146.0,4.08,three-dimensional and we have certain
147.68,4.08,specific kinds of plots for different
150.08,4.159,scientific purposes or anything like
151.76,4.96,that uh however we are going to pick 3d
154.239,4.881,and then we're going to just say ax dot
156.72,4.08,scatter so the basic scatter function
159.12,4.08,and this time we provide three
160.8,5.6,coordinates not just two so we have x y
163.2,5.92,and z let's say three five seven for
166.4,6.64,example and then plt
169.12,5.839,show we're going to click on run
173.04,3.44,and we're going to hopefully see a
174.959,3.841,three-dimensional plot now i'm not going
176.48,4.32,to rotate too much here because when i'm
178.8,3.6,recording and i'm using math a little
180.8,5.04,bit at the same time
182.4,5.44,it's usually very laggy but you can also
185.84,3.6,move this around here as you can see
187.84,4.16,it's lagging i hope my recording is not
189.44,4.4,crashing on me here uh but basically we
192.0,3.36,can turn this around we can look at it
193.84,3.119,from different perspectives you can see
195.36,3.12,the coordinates here and this is the
196.959,3.681,point that we actually plotted so i'm
198.48,3.839,not gonna rotate too much throughout
200.64,3.12,this video but that's how you do it you
202.319,2.56,just use the mouse
203.76,2.64,um
204.879,3.601,and that's how you plot a single point
206.4,5.04,now if you wanna make a scatter plot
208.48,5.039,based on multiple arrays of individual
211.44,4.64,coordinates we're going to just say
213.519,4.241,scatter plots here
216.08,3.28,we are going to create a new axis here
217.76,3.36,as well or actually we don't have to do
219.36,2.799,all this in a row let's just replace
221.12,2.479,this
222.159,4.321,with uh
223.599,5.28,with new code we're going to again do
226.48,3.26,plt axes
228.879,3.28,projection
229.74,5.779,[Music]
232.159,7.041,3d and then we're going to say
235.519,6.881,x data equals npa range
239.2,5.84,and a range is basically you choose a
242.4,4.8,starting point you choose an end point
245.04,3.52,and then the step size it's not like lin
247.2,3.92,space and length space you choose a
248.56,4.08,starting point an end point and then how
251.12,4.16,many values you want to generate in
252.64,5.439,between here we specify the step size so
255.28,5.84,this would mean uh start from zero and
258.079,4.881,with a step size of 0.1 increase until
261.12,4.079,you get to 50.
262.96,5.679,we're going to do that for x we're going
265.199,4.401,to then uh also generate y data the same
268.639,2.721,way
269.6,4.96,uh or actually let's do it in a
271.36,4.8,different way let's say x data equals np
274.56,3.04,dot because we don't want to have a
276.16,3.36,structure we want to have some random
277.6,5.12,stuff here so we're going to say np
279.52,5.2,random dot rand int
282.72,4.8,from 0 to 100
284.72,4.4,we want to have the shape 500
287.52,2.88,uh like that so basically one
289.12,2.72,dimensional
290.4,4.88,uh and then we're going to do the same
291.84,5.68,thing for the y data for the z data and
295.28,4.4,yeah that's basically just 100
297.52,4.399,uh or just 500
299.68,5.12,random points and for this we're just
301.919,4.241,going to say ax dot scatter
304.8,2.88,x data
306.16,2.8,y data
307.68,2.88,z data
308.96,5.28,like that
310.56,3.68,and of course plt dot show
314.8,4.56,so that should look quite messy now
318.08,3.839,there you go
319.36,4.32,again we can rotate but it's going to be
321.919,3.601,laggy but here you can see the
323.68,3.76,individual data points
325.52,3.519,so this is a very basic scatter plot and
327.44,3.599,of course we can do the same thing as
329.039,4.88,always now i'm not sure what the
331.039,5.121,individual parameters were was it marker
333.919,4.72,or was it m i'm not sure
336.16,4.319,let's just try with
338.639,3.681,with marker but i think it was m or
340.479,3.841,something
342.32,3.36,no there you go it was actually marker
344.32,3.04,so you can change the marker you can
345.68,3.12,change the color map you can change the
347.36,4.96,alpha value
348.8,5.92,so we can say alpha equals 0.1 i mean i
352.32,3.68,think this should work here
354.72,3.36,there you go then we have more
356.0,4.24,transparency here uh so you can
358.08,4.0,customize it like an ordinary 2d plot
360.24,3.2,but it's in three dimension uh three
362.08,2.8,dimensions now
363.44,3.199,now let's say we don't want to plot
364.88,3.92,points we want to plot let's say a
366.639,4.241,function so we have some input values x
368.8,4.399,and y and we want to have a function on
370.88,4.0,the z coordinate if you want to do that
373.199,4.081,of course let's just not delete all of
374.88,5.439,this let's just delete this
377.28,6.96,we're going to now say x data
380.319,6.72,equals np a range
384.24,4.799,from 0 to 100 shape 500 this makes more
387.039,2.88,sense here because we want to have an
389.039,3.801,uh
389.919,4.641,oh sorry i'm stupid a
392.84,2.76,range
394.56,4.0,0
395.6,4.48,50 and 0.1 this was what i wanted to do
398.56,3.68,in this case it makes more sense because
400.08,4.88,of course we want to have equally
402.24,4.32,uh sized ticks on the x and y
404.96,3.44,coordinates and then the z coordinates
406.56,3.68,should be the result of whatever
408.4,5.919,calculation we choose to make so we can
410.24,6.959,say z data is basically just x data
414.319,4.88,times y data a very simple function
417.199,3.28,and if we do that
419.199,5.44,we can say
420.479,6.481,uh p or actually axis dot
424.639,4.161,um
426.96,3.44,was it scatter
428.8,3.36,actually we should probably go with plot
430.4,2.799,but let's see with scatter it works as
432.16,3.36,well but
433.199,3.681,it's more like a collection of points on
435.52,3.6,a line
436.88,4.48,but i see that in my prepared code for
439.12,3.919,some reason i used
441.36,3.36,scatter i think this is a mistake i
443.039,3.201,think plot is actually the better
444.72,3.28,function here
446.24,4.32,you can see here that we have a function
448.0,6.08,but it's actually consisting of
450.56,5.039,um can i zoom in here
454.08,2.959,come on
455.599,2.88,however you can see it's individual
457.039,2.88,points if you look closely you can see
458.479,3.12,it's not actually aligned so i think
459.919,3.921,this should be
461.599,4.081,easy to fix by just using plot but i'm
463.84,3.759,not sure since this is not the code i
465.68,3.6,prepared here it's a little bit yeah
467.599,3.201,there you go obviously it works better
469.28,3.199,if you choose plot because then it's
470.8,2.88,actually plotting a line
472.479,3.921,um
473.68,5.44,so this of course is also not true here
476.4,3.919,so this is basically plotting a function
479.12,3.359,now you can choose whatever function you
480.319,4.801,want you can of course also say np dot
482.479,5.681,sine of x data
485.12,4.479,times np dot cosine of y data for
488.16,3.68,example
489.599,4.0,and then you'll get a different function
491.84,3.28,obviously there you go in three
493.599,4.88,dimensions
495.12,5.359,uh but that's how you do a basic
498.479,4.321,function or how you plot a basic
500.479,3.681,function along an axis now one thing
502.8,3.44,that i also want to do here before we
504.16,3.599,get to the next uh topic which are
506.24,2.799,surface plots
507.759,2.88,i'm gonna talk a little bit about
509.039,4.24,customization because of course we
510.639,3.921,always wanna have some titles and labels
513.279,3.44,and all that and that is not too
514.56,3.919,different from what we usually do you
516.719,4.88,basically plot something and then you
518.479,5.68,say ax dot set underscore title and then
521.599,4.881,we can say okay i don't know uh funny
524.159,5.921,function could be the title
526.48,5.44,and then i can say ax dot set underscore
530.08,3.6,x label
531.92,6.0,and this is going to be
533.68,7.04,my x values in centimeters for example
537.92,5.76,then we can go with my y label
540.72,4.08,or my y values in i don't know
543.68,4.76,vault
544.8,3.64,and then we can say
548.8,5.44,my
550.8,4.32,fancy results
554.24,2.88,in
555.12,3.68,in this case i don't know
557.12,2.8,centimeters times vault doesn't really
558.8,3.92,make sense
559.92,4.24,however we're going to do it like that
562.72,2.72,just so we have something and then we
564.16,3.04,can show that
565.44,2.56,and you will see that we have
567.2,2.56,some
568.0,3.04,labels here as well
569.76,3.04,all right now let us get to more
571.04,3.12,interesting stuff and talk about surface
572.8,3.52,plots this means that we're not just
574.16,4.0,going to plot individual lines in three
576.32,3.92,dimensions but we're going to actually
578.16,3.76,plot the whole surface of the function
580.24,4.32,because up until now what we did is
581.92,4.96,let's say those are the x values one two
584.56,4.48,three four five six seven and so on and
586.88,4.72,then one two three four five six seven
589.04,4.32,and so on are also the y values what we
591.6,4.239,did up until now is let's say the
593.36,3.84,function was z equals
595.839,4.161,x times
597.2,4.72,y what we did actually was not computing
600.0,3.92,the whole function for a surface plot we
601.92,5.039,just took the individual positions and
603.92,8.4,combined them so 1 times 1 is 1 2 times
606.959,7.44,2 is 4 3 times 3 is 9 then 16 25 36 49
612.32,4.24,and so on
614.399,4.0,this is basically what we did it was
616.56,3.92,just taking the individual positions and
618.399,4.161,combining them together however in order
620.48,4.64,to plot the full function as a surface
622.56,4.719,we need to combine all the values of x
625.12,4.8,with all the values of y so we have to
627.279,5.361,take 1 times 1 1 times 2 1 times 3 and
629.92,4.4,so on until we have all the values and
632.64,3.28,then we have one row of the z
634.32,2.639,coordinates and this is what we're going
635.92,2.72,to do now we're going to create a
636.959,4.081,so-called mesh grid we're going to use a
638.64,4.48,meshgrid function to create a grid of
641.04,5.76,the value so that we have basically for
643.12,5.44,each element in y we have a row with all
646.8,4.159,the elements in x so that we can then
648.56,4.8,combine them in z together so that we
650.959,4.721,have this final grid of the results and
653.36,4.0,we can use this grid to plot a surface
655.68,3.92,plot in the end
657.36,3.76,i hope this was somewhat understandable
659.6,3.679,basically we would have something like
661.12,4.88,that we would have one two three
663.279,4.401,four five six and then one two three or
666.0,2.72,actually let's just copy that
667.68,2.24,uh
668.72,3.28,that
669.92,3.919,would be for example the mesh grid of x
672.0,3.44,and then we would have if the values are
673.839,3.68,the same obviously we would have the
675.44,3.44,same thing for y and then when we
677.519,3.841,combine them we would have the
678.88,5.92,individual results in a
681.36,5.919,uh six by six matrix or six by six array
684.8,4.08,as the z values again and then we could
687.279,2.881,plot a surface plot
688.88,5.44,so for this we're going to start again
690.16,7.04,with ax equals plt axis projection
694.32,4.48,projection equals 3d
697.2,4.4,and then we're going to say x data
698.8,4.4,equals npa range
701.6,5.12,0
703.2,5.92,250 with a step size 0.1
706.72,5.04,y data is the same and now these are
709.12,5.44,just one row of the values so we have
711.76,5.28,the values from 0 to 50 with the step
714.56,4.32,size but we just have them one time we
717.04,4.239,got to take this and
718.88,4.0,uh duplicate the rows if you want as
721.279,3.36,many times as there are elements in y
722.88,3.92,data and then we do the same for y as
724.639,3.2,well with the amount of elements in x
726.8,2.8,data
727.839,4.721,um so what we're going to do is we're
729.6,6.16,going to say capital x capital y equals
732.56,6.24,np dot mesh grid and we're going to pass
735.76,5.92,x data and y data there you go and we
738.8,5.2,can then print x for example to see what
741.68,4.48,x looks like so to get a basic idea of
744.0,4.32,what we're actually doing here
746.16,4.799,and there you go you can see that we
748.32,4.72,have one row of the values and we have
750.959,3.12,multiple rows of the same values and y
753.04,2.88,is looking
754.079,2.961,is going to look the exact same way and
755.92,3.52,now what we're going to do is we're
757.04,5.28,going to define the z function by just
759.44,5.839,saying x times y of course capital x and
762.32,4.4,capital y and then z of course is also
765.279,2.641,such a grid
766.72,2.239,but
767.92,4.039,it's going to look a little bit
768.959,3.0,different
772.079,5.281,you go so z is basically also such a
774.88,4.8,grid with the individual results in
777.36,3.68,order to plot this grid as a surface
779.68,2.719,plot now what we're going to do is we're
781.04,3.799,going to say
782.399,5.44,ax dot
784.839,4.841,plot underscore surface
787.839,3.44,and we're going to plot x
789.68,5.279,y and z
791.279,3.68,like that and then plt dot show
796.24,4.88,there you go
798.639,4.161,and this is what we end up with again i
801.12,2.88,hope this is not going to lack too much
802.8,4.24,let me just
804.0,4.959,see if i'm crashing my recording uh but
807.04,3.68,this is as you can see the basic surface
808.959,4.081,i'm going to rotate it a little bit so
810.72,5.28,that you get an idea of how it works
813.04,5.28,um yeah that's basically it the surface
816.0,3.839,plot of x times y if x and y are the
818.32,3.6,same values
819.839,4.081,this is a very simple plot let's go
821.92,3.039,ahead and do something more fancy let's
823.92,6.719,just
824.959,5.68,change this to np dot sine of x plus
830.8,4.08,uh np or actually times
833.44,3.6,np
834.88,4.319,dot cosine of y let me just see what
837.04,4.0,range i chose here because if we choose
839.199,3.521,that range it's going to be extremely
841.04,3.359,messy so i'm going to change this here
842.72,5.2,to negative 5
844.399,6.081,up until 5 and negative 5 up until 5
847.92,5.599,here as well with the same step size
850.48,5.12,and then we can run this hopefully and
853.519,3.201,see a somewhat interesting plot there
855.6,2.799,you go
856.72,3.76,so it's all blue as you can see but we
858.399,5.281,have these little bumps here
860.48,5.28,uh we can also rotate this a little bit
863.68,4.32,there you go you can see these waves
865.76,4.56,that are of course produced by the sine
868.0,4.24,and cosine function
870.32,3.44,and what we can now do as well this is
872.24,3.52,very interesting in my opinion is we can
873.76,5.28,add a color map to it which basically
875.76,5.439,means that the higher the values um
879.04,4.72,or when the height changes the color
881.199,4.32,changes as well and it changes based on
883.76,5.519,the provided color map so we can say
885.519,5.76,cmap equals and then plasma
889.279,3.36,uh now you can choose a different column
891.279,3.601,map you can go to the map of the
892.639,4.161,documentation and look at the color maps
894.88,4.319,but i'm going to just choose plasma for
896.8,4.08,now and if we run this you're going to
899.199,2.481,see that this looks actually kind of
900.88,2.24,sick
901.68,3.36,so you can see that the higher the
903.12,4.159,values the more yellow they are and the
905.04,4.96,lower the values the more purple they
907.279,4.161,are in the middle they're orange pink
910.0,3.519,red whatever
911.44,3.6,but this is actually quite a cool plot
913.519,4.241,in my opinion
915.04,5.28,a basic surface plot now the last thing
917.76,4.96,i want to show you is how we can rotate
920.32,4.24,the plot uh
922.72,3.44,programmatically so not just with a
924.56,2.959,mouse but how we can actually set the
926.16,3.119,values
927.519,3.44,by default so maybe when we run the
929.279,4.081,script we don't want to see the plot
930.959,5.041,from this perspective here but we want
933.36,5.76,to see it from a different perspective
936.0,4.56,again please don't crash
939.12,3.04,there you go so maybe you want to see it
940.56,4.0,from that perspective and what's
942.16,4.72,important here is uh the two values that
944.56,4.24,you see here on the upper right when we
946.88,4.8,rotate so when i drag this here you can
948.8,4.24,see we have this azimuth and we have the
951.68,3.599,elevation
953.04,4.64,um this is basic those are basically the
955.279,4.401,two values that determine the position
957.68,4.399,that we look at this from so let's just
959.68,3.519,say we want to look from added top down
962.079,3.601,like that
963.199,4.64,this would be azimuth of negative zero
965.68,5.92,or basically zero and elevation of
967.839,6.961,roughly 90 degrees so let's note that
971.6,9.28,we had the
974.8,8.88,azimuth of zero and the elevation of
980.88,5.04,90. and we can choose these two values
983.68,4.56,now manually in order to
985.92,4.719,uh to initialize the view so we can say
988.24,4.64,ax oh sorry
990.639,4.801,ax dot
992.88,4.639,view underscore init and here we can say
995.44,5.519,asm equals zero
997.519,5.921,and lf equals 90.
1000.959,4.401,can then remove this and basically we
1003.44,2.72,don't change anything else we just run
1005.36,2.88,this
1006.16,4.96,and you're going to see that the default
1008.24,4.32,perspective is going to be top down
1011.12,2.399,alright so that's it for today's video
