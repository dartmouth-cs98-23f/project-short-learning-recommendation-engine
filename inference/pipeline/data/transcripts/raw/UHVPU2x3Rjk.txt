second,duration,transcript
1.159,5.14,you kind of mentioned the different
4.38,4.71,maybe radical computational medium like
6.299,4.831,biological and there's other ideas so
9.09,4.53,there's a lot of spaces in a6 or
11.13,4.53,domain-specific and then there could be
13.62,4.649,quantum computers and wood so we can
15.66,4.65,think of all those different mediums and
18.269,4.711,types of computation what's the
20.31,5.939,connection between swapping out
22.98,4.859,different hardware systems in the
26.249,3.391,instruction set do you see those as
27.839,4.321,disjoint or they fundamentally coupled
29.64,7.29,yeah so what's so kind of if we go back
32.16,6.449,to the history you know when Moore's Law
36.93,4.74,is in full effect and you're getting
38.609,5.61,twice as many transistors every couple
41.67,4.29,of years you know kind of the challenge
44.219,3.39,for computer designers is how can we
45.96,4.11,take advantage of that how can we turn
47.609,5.07,those transistors into better computers
50.07,6.66,faster typically and so there was an era
52.679,7.171,I guess in the 80s and 90s where
56.73,6.09,computers were doubling performance
59.85,6.57,every 18 months and if you weren't
62.82,6.54,around then what would happen is you had
66.42,5.19,your computer and your friend's computer
69.36,4.56,which was like a year year and a half
71.61,4.53,newer and it was much faster than your
73.92,4.17,computer and you he he or she could get
76.14,3.54,their work done much faster than your
78.09,3.45,typical achiever so people took their
79.68,4.979,computers perfectly good computers and
81.54,5.609,threw them away to buy a newer computer
84.659,5.1,because the computer one or two years
87.149,4.591,later was so much faster so that's what
89.759,4.89,the world was like in the 80s and 90s
91.74,5.64,well with the slowing down of Moore's
94.649,5.07,Law that's no longer true right he's not
97.38,4.26,now with you know not death side
99.719,4.86,computers with the laptops I only get a
101.64,5.549,new laptop when it breaks right well
104.579,3.96,damn the disk broke or this display
107.189,3.18,broke I got to buy a new computer but
108.539,4.08,before you would throw them away because
110.369,5.221,it just they were just so sluggish
112.619,8.07,compared to the latest computers so
115.59,8.73,that's you know that's a huge change of
120.689,6.091,what's gone on so but yes since this
124.32,5.43,lasted for decades kind of programmers
126.78,6.72,and maybe all of society is used to
129.75,5.19,computers getting faster regularly it we
133.5,3.27,now now believe those of
134.94,4.02,who are in computer design it's called
136.77,4.94,computer architecture that the path
138.96,6.75,forward is instead is to add
141.71,6.15,accelerators that only work well for
145.71,6.15,certain applications
147.86,6.7,so since Moore's law is slowing down
151.86,5.19,we don't think general-purpose computers
154.56,4.41,are and get a lot faster so the Intel
157.05,3.36,process of the world are not going to
158.97,4.5,haven't been getting a lot faster
160.41,3.6,they've been barely improving like a few
163.47,2.76,percent a year
164.01,4.62,it used to be doubling every 18 months
166.23,4.65,and now it's doubling every 20 years so
168.63,4.44,it was just shocking so to be able to
170.88,4.47,deliver on what Moore's Law used to do
173.07,5.27,we think what's going to happen what is
175.35,5.34,happening right now is people adding
178.34,6.0,accelerators to their microprocessors
180.69,7.38,that only work well for some domains and
184.34,5.86,by sheer coincidence at the same time
188.07,3.9,that this is happening has been this
190.2,6.57,revolution in artificial intelligence
191.97,8.04,called machine learning so with as I'm
196.77,5.73,sure your other guests have said you
200.01,4.949,know a I had these two competing schools
202.5,4.05,of thought is that we could figure out
204.959,4.471,artificial intelligence by just writing
206.55,5.79,the rules top-down or that was wrong you
209.43,4.47,had to look at data and infer what the
212.34,4.41,rules are the machine learning and
213.9,4.53,what's happened in the last decade or
216.75,4.739,eight years this machine learning has
218.43,5.25,won and it turns out that machine
221.489,5.431,learning the hardware you built for
223.68,6.99,machine learning is pretty much multiply
226.92,5.24,the matrix multiply is a key feature for
230.67,5.46,the way people machine learning is done
232.16,6.01,so that's a godsend for computer
236.13,4.02,designers we know how to make metrics
238.17,3.78,multiply run really fast so
240.15,3.66,general-purpose microprocessors are
241.95,3.539,slowing down we're adding accelerators
243.81,4.05,for machine learning that fundamentally
245.489,3.451,are doing matrix multiplies much more
247.86,4.02,efficiently than general-purpose
248.94,4.86,computers have done so we have to come
251.88,3.69,up with a new way to accelerate things
253.8,3.18,the danger of only accelerating one
255.57,4.139,application is how important is that
256.98,4.59,application turns a translate machine
259.709,6.121,learning gets used for all kinds of
261.57,6.48,things so serendipitously we found
265.83,3.059,something to accelerate that's widely
268.05,3.299,applicable
268.889,3.541,and we don't even we're in the middle of
271.349,2.79,this revolution of machine learning
272.43,3.78,we're not sure what the limits of
274.139,5.131,machine learning are so this has been
276.21,5.699,kind of a godsend if you're going to be
279.27,6.269,able to Excel deliver on improved
281.909,6.0,performance as long as people are moving
285.539,4.261,their programs to be embracing more
287.909,3.84,machine learning we know how to give
289.8,3.199,them more performance even as Moore's
291.749,5.22,Law is slowing down and
292.999,6.361,counter-intuitively the machine learning
296.969,5.461,mechanism you can say is domain-specific
299.36,7.649,but because it's leveraging data it's
302.43,7.38,actually could be very broad in terms of
307.009,4.75,in terms of the domains that could be
309.81,4.979,applied in yeah that's exactly right
311.759,4.351,sort of it's almost sort of people
314.789,4.56,sometimes talk about the idea of
316.11,5.579,software 2.0 we're almost taking another
319.349,5.461,step up in the abstraction layer in
321.689,5.1,designing machine learning systems
324.81,3.84,because now you're programming in the
326.789,3.78,space of data in the space of hyper
328.65,4.59,parameters it's changing fundamentally
330.569,5.611,the nature of programming and so the
333.24,4.679,specialized devices that that accelerate
336.18,3.509,the performance especially neural
337.919,5.851,network based machine learning systems
339.689,6.361,might become the new general yes so the
343.77,5.34,this thing that's interesting point out
346.05,6.089,these are not coral these are not tied
349.11,5.669,together the it's enthusiasm about
352.139,4.921,machine learning about creating programs
354.779,3.75,driven from data that we should figure
357.06,3.539,out the answers from data rather than
358.529,4.5,kind of top down which classically the
360.599,3.901,way most programming is done and the way
363.029,4.11,artificial intelligent used to be done
364.5,6.36,that's a movement that's going on at the
367.139,5.131,same time coincidentally and the the
370.86,4.38,first word machine learnings of machines
372.27,5.19,right so that's going to increase the
375.24,4.409,demand for computing because instead of
377.46,4.199,programmers being smart writing those
379.649,4.14,those things down we're going to instead
381.659,4.021,use computers to examine a lot of data
383.789,6.66,to kind of create the programs that's
385.68,5.969,the idea and remarkably this gets used
390.449,3.361,for all kinds of things very
391.649,3.811,successfully the image recognition the
393.81,6.659,language translation the game playing
395.46,7.079,and you know he gets into pieces of the
400.469,2.341,software stack like databases and stuff
402.539,1.861,like that
402.81,3.48,we're not quite sure how journal
404.4,3.66,purposes but that's going on independent
406.29,3.42,this hardware stuff what's happening on
408.06,3.27,the hardware side is Moore's law is
409.71,4.35,slowing down right when we need a lot
411.33,4.77,more cycles it's failing us it's failing
414.06,3.81,us right when we need it because there's
416.1,4.44,going to be a greater in peace a greater
417.87,4.08,increase in computing and then this idea
420.54,4.17,that we're going to do so-called
421.95,4.77,domain-specific here's a domain that
424.71,5.34,your greatest fear is you'll make this
426.72,6.11,one thing work and that'll help you know
430.05,4.89,5% of the people in the world well this
432.83,3.82,this looks like it's a very general
434.94,5.55,purpose thing so the timing is
436.65,5.91,fortuitous that if we can perhaps if we
440.49,4.89,can keep building hardware that will
442.56,6.18,accelerate machine learning the neural
445.38,5.36,networks that'll beat the timing be
448.74,5.1,right that that neural network
450.74,5.71,revolution will transform your software
453.84,4.02,the so called software 2.0 and the
456.45,3.21,software the future will be very
457.86,4.559,different from the software the past and
459.66,3.96,just as our microprocessors even though
462.419,4.711,we're still going to have that same
463.62,4.98,basic risk instructions to run a big
467.13,3.81,pieces of the software stack like user
468.6,4.77,interfaces and stuff like that we can
470.94,3.99,accelerate the the kind of a small piece
473.37,3.75,that's computationally intensive it's
474.93,4.2,not lots of lines of code but there it
477.12,4.08,takes a lot of cycles to run that code
479.13,4.08,that that's going to be the accelerator
481.2,5.67,piece and so this that's what makes us
483.21,6.54,from a computer designer's perspective a
486.87,4.95,really interesting decade but Hennessy
489.75,4.08,and I talked about in the title of our
491.82,5.58,Turing warrant speech is a new golden
493.83,6.899,age we we see this as a very exciting
497.4,5.19,decade much like when we were assistant
500.729,3.511,professors and the wrists stuff was
502.59,2.91,going on that was a very exciting time
504.24,3.44,was where we were changing what was
505.5,4.889,going on we see this happening again
507.68,5.289,tremendous opportunities of people
510.389,4.141,because we're fundamentally changing how
512.969,4.051,software is built and how we're running
514.53,4.77,it so which layer of the abstraction do
517.02,4.8,you think most of the acceleration might
519.3,5.01,be happening if you look in the next ten
521.82,4.29,years that Google is working on a lot of
524.31,3.93,exciting stuff with the TPU sort of
526.11,5.43,there's a closer to the hardware that
528.24,5.25,could be optimizations around the IROC
531.54,3.99,closer to the instruction set that could
533.49,3.12,be optimization at the compiler level it
535.53,3.809,could be even at the high
536.61,4.8,level software stack yeah it's got to be
539.339,4.381,I mean if you think about the the old
541.41,4.47,risks this debate it was both
543.72,5.39,it was software hardware it was the
545.88,5.28,compilers improving as well as the
549.11,5.349,architecture improving and that that's
551.16,5.72,likely to be the way things are now with
554.459,5.25,machine learning they they're using
556.88,6.519,domain-specific languages the languages
559.709,5.13,like tensorflow and pi torch are very
563.399,3.93,popular with the machine learning people
564.839,4.111,that those are the raising the level of
567.329,3.231,abstraction it's easier for people to
568.95,5.19,write machine learning in these
570.56,5.17,domain-specific languages like like pi
574.14,4.11,torch in tensorflow
575.73,5.01,so we're the most optimization right
578.25,4.56,yeah and so the and so they'll be both
580.74,4.529,the compiler piece and the hardware
582.81,4.56,piece underneath it so as you kind of
585.269,4.711,the fatal flaw for hardware people is to
587.37,4.709,create really great hardware but not
589.98,3.81,have brought along the compilers and
592.079,3.871,what we're seeing right now in the
593.79,4.68,marketplace because of this enthusiasm
595.95,5.19,around hardware for machine learning is
598.47,4.71,getting you know probably a billions of
601.14,3.75,dollars invested in start-up companies
603.18,4.529,we're seeing startup companies go
604.89,4.59,belly-up because they focus on the
607.709,4.281,hardware but didn't bring the software
609.48,2.51,stack along
618.22,2.06,you
