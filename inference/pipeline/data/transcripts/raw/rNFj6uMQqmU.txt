3.2,4.08,"Next let’s see how we make the 
prediction. Predictive model is the  "
7.28,3.6,"function that maps the input features 
of the patient to the output target.  "
11.84,5.84,"For example, if we know a patient’s past 
diagnosis, medication, and lab result, if we also  "
17.68,5.76,"know this function, then we can assess how likely 
the patient will have heart failure. Depending on  "
23.44,5.12,"the value of the target, the model can be either 
regression problems or a classification problem."
29.52,6.16,"In regression problem, the target is continuous. 
For example, if we want to predict the cost that  "
35.68,4.8,"a patient will incur to the healthcare systems, 
then it’s a regression problem, and y is the cost  "
40.48,5.6,"in dollars. The popular method includes linear 
regression and generalized additive model."
47.04,5.04,"If the target is categorical, for example, 
whether the patient has heart failure or not,  "
52.08,5.2,"then it’s a classification problem. Popular 
methods include logistic regression,  "
57.28,3.36,"support vector machine, decision 
tree, and random forest.  "
61.68,7.28,"You will learn all these methods in 
separate lectures such as machine learning."
