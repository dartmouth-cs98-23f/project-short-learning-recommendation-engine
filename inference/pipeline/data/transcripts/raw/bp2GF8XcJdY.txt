0.24,4.64,data driven documents or d3 is a
3.12,3.759,javascript library for creating
4.88,3.92,interactive data visualizations with
6.879,4.161,scalable vector graphics if you've ever
8.8,3.919,been to a website that has a graph map
11.04,4.08,scatter plot histogram dependency
12.719,4.56,diagram b swarm tree map or pie chart
15.12,4.72,it's probably powered by d3 under the
17.279,4.881,hood it was created in 2011 with the
19.84,4.48,goal of generating svg graphics from
22.16,4.64,data drawing a data visualization by
24.32,4.08,hand is extremely difficult with d3 you
26.8,3.6,start with some input data then write
28.4,3.679,some javascript to programmatically draw
30.4,3.76,the graphic for you which can then be
32.079,3.761,made interactive with things like labels
34.16,3.76,and controls and when the underlying
35.84,4.16,data changes it can interpolate and
37.92,4.08,animate between values resulting in a
40.0,3.92,beautiful visual for the end user that's
42.0,4.16,built entirely on web standards that you
43.92,5.04,already know like html css and
46.16,4.879,javascript its api allows you to select
48.96,3.68,and manipulate items in the dom not much
51.039,3.52,different than something like jquery
52.64,3.919,what makes d3 different is that you can
54.559,3.84,set properties as functions that
56.559,3.921,automatically draw different graphics
58.399,3.761,based on your data to get started you'll
60.48,3.999,first want to grab an element from the
62.16,4.72,dom with the select method like an empty
64.479,4.481,svg you could then draw a single shape
66.88,4.0,inside of it with the append method and
68.96,3.76,customize its appearance by chaining the
70.88,3.919,attribute method to it that draws a
72.72,4.0,single shape but the real power of d3
74.799,4.0,comes into play when you attach data to
76.72,3.92,a selection instead of using a for loop
78.799,4.0,to draw a bunch of shapes the select all
80.64,3.76,method allows you to describe how to
82.799,3.521,draw shape making your code more
84.4,3.52,declarative you can then attach data to
86.32,3.52,it in the form of an array or an
87.92,3.839,external file and it will draw a shape
89.84,4.319,for every point in your data set each
91.759,4.641,point has three possible states enter
94.159,4.401,update and exit enter is when you would
96.4,4.079,initially draw your shape but d3 also
98.56,3.919,keeps track of changes to the data set
100.479,4.161,allowing you to react when data is
102.479,3.92,updated or removed it also provides a
104.64,3.2,bunch of features to make your data look
106.399,3.441,beautiful like helpers that
107.84,4.639,automatically draw scales along the x
109.84,4.639,and y axis based on the domain and range
112.479,4.0,of the data or you might use transition
114.479,3.92,to create an animation as each data
116.479,3.6,point is added to the chart and finally
118.399,3.921,you might listen to events to add
120.079,5.201,tooltips or other interactive elements
122.32,4.399,to your chart this has been d3js in 100
