good day so welcome to our virtual class
week one
our top today is about
introduction to human computer
interaction
in everyday life or in every day we
interact with many things like cell
phone
tv remote easy remote keyboard mouse and
other devices like atm
web or mobile application which is part
of our life sometimes we take time to
understand the design and sometimes we
don't take time it to understand
so it's about poor and good design
interaction is the connection between
the user and the device or application
interaction design is concerned with
designing interactive products to
support people in their everyday and
working lives interaction design is a
big business
in every company
so what is a human computer interaction
hci is the study and the practice of
usability
hdi is the study of how people use
computer system to perform certain tasks
human computer interaction is a
multi-disciplinary field of study
focusing on the design of the computer
technology and in particular the
interaction between human
the user and the computer
while initially concerned with the
computers hci has since expanded to
cover almost all forms of information
technology design
human computer interaction is an area of
research and practice that emerged in
the early 1980s
initially as a specialty area in
computer science embracing cognitive
science and human factor engineering
hci has expanded rapidly and steadily
for three decades
attracting professionals from many other
disciplines and incorporating diverse
concepts and approaches
by considerable extent each cis now
aggregates a collection of
semi-autonomous field of research and
practice in human-centered informatics
however the continuing
synthesis
of display conception and approaches to
science and practice in hcis has
produced a dramatic example of how
different epistemologies and paradigms
can be concealed and integrated in a
vibrant and productive intellectual
project
again so what is human computer
interaction hci concerning
process which design evaluation and
implementation
process on interactive computing system
for human use
plus the study of major phenomena
surrounding them
so the goal of hci
are to produce usable
and safe system as well as functional
system in order
to produce a computer system with good
usability developer must attempt to
first understand the factors that
determine how people use technology
develop tools and techniques enable
building suitable system
achieve efficient and effective and safe
interaction
and put
people purse
so underlying the whole theme of hci is
the belief that people using computer
system should come first so their needs
capabilities and preference for
product uh conducting various styles
should direct developers in the way
that they design system
people should not have to change the way
that they use a system in order to fit
within it instead the system should be
designed to match their requirements
okay so the goal of hci ensuring
usability
a usable software system is that
supports the effective and efficient
completion of tasks in a given work
context by carton daton in 1985 so the
bottom line benefits a more usable
software system to business user include
first increase productivity
decrease user training time and costs
decrease
user errors
increase accuracy of data input data
interpretation decrease need for ongoing
technical support
so the bottom line benefits of usability
to develop organizations include greater
profits due to more competitive products
and services
decrease overall development and
maintenance costs
decrease the customer support costs
more power business due to satisfied
customer so not to use a term user
friendly which is tended to mean a
system with high usability but always
misinterpreted to mean tidying up the
screen display to make it more missing
okay so when we say usability okay it's
one of the key concept in hci
it is concerned with making the system
easy to learn and use
so a usable system is again
easy to learn
easy to remember how to use
effective to use
efficient to use
safe to use and enjoyable to use
so another question is why usability is
important
so many everyday system and products
seems to be designed with a little
regard to usability
this leads to persuasion we said times
an error
this contains example of interactive
products
mobile phone computer personal organizer
remote control sublink machine copy
machine atm ticket machine library
information system
uh photocopier okay
so
how many of these systems are actually
effortless and enjoyable to use okay
so the goal of hci to achieve usability
the design of the user interface to any
interactive product needs to take into
account and to be tailored around a
number of factors including first
cognitive perceptual and motor
capabilities and contains of people in
general
second spatial a unique characteristic
of the intended user population in
particular
unique characteristic of user physical
and social work environment
unique characteristic and requirements
of the user tasks which are being
supported by the software
unique capabilities and constraint of
the chosen software
and or hardware platform for the product
so nowadays human cognitive aspects have
become more and more important for
interaction design
cognition refers to what goes on in
human mind when they carry out everyday
activities so it involves sets of
cognitive processes such as thinking
remembering learning and decision making
through the study of this human
cognitive process the developer of
interaction system can be better at
understanding user
psychological characteristics during the
process of interacting with computer
system
it is crucial for the developer to
design high quality interaction system
which make the interaction between the
user and the system more effective and
efficiently
this presentation will uh
explain what cognition is and why it's
important for interaction design
but this may take a cognitive process
interaction example to explain how
cognition applied to the
inter
action design
a human computer interaction has
generally been seen as a discipline that
identifies principles and techniques for
designing and evaluating user interface
and human computer system
there are many reasons for difficult
difficulty in developing a strong
scientific basis for human computer
interaction users are people without
shaded in psychological characteristic
and
diversity diversity
however psychology as a discipline has
yet to describe fully the function and
the properties of human person let alone
the function and properties of people
interacting with the complex technology
this means that each application and
software interface represent an
experiment so we'll be able to spot an
obvious problem with an interface using
general principles such as stimulus
response
compatibility
so human computer interaction
okay so the h
the human
goods at sensing low level simulated
pattern recognition inductive reasoning
multiple strategies adapting hazard
advancing
so human
or the in computer interaction
again is the study of people interact
with the computer and to what extent
computers are not developed for
successful interaction with human being
let's name hc
of three parts against
the user the computer itself and the way
they work together
then we have the computer
okay so the
computer good accounting and measuring
accurate storage and recall rapid
increase consistent responsive data
processing calculation repetitive action
performance over time simple and sharply
defined things
when we talk about computer we're
referring to any technology ranging from
desktop computer to large scale computer
system
for example we were discussing the
design of a website then the website
itself would be reverse referred as the
computer so divide such as mobile phones
or b cr can also be considered to be a
computer
then the i that is skill somewhat
complementary that human do what human
do best and computer do what computer do
best
so by the user we may mean the
individual user group or user working
together and appreciation the way people
sensor system example site hearing and
touch relay information is a vital also
different user from different conception
or mental models about their interaction
and have different ways of learning and
keeping knowledge in addition cultural
and national differences play also apart
okay next we have the three broad
categories of a computer system
okay
so we have
okay so we have the
first the expert user
with detailed knowledge of the
particular system
so the expert user with the detailed
knowledge of the particular system so
expert user
are defined as individuals who reach uh
interaction knowledge past knowledge and
domain knowledge specific system and who
are skillful in obtaining and using such
knowledge to achieve goals or tasks in
an interaction
then we have the occasional users
who know well how to perform the tasks
they need to perform frequently
occasional user
okay so
this user will learn only enough about
the system to accomplish their immediate
needs or specific needs the occasional
user someone with a human service
organization would only need to use a
particular information system on
occasional rather than irregular disease
then we have the last one we have the
novice who are never used the system
before
okay so i know guys it's a broad sense
you know it's a person who is new or is
inexperienced in a certain task or
situation maybe sends a label embrace
the other levels like beginners or a new
user of the system
a novice user is not familiar
with the system operation
so teaching user interface development
to software
engineers gary verman on ohio university
there are not many specialists in user
interface development
so most software user interface are
designed and built by the software
engineers
software engineers who have been trained
in user interface development should
have gained perspective
learn about methods and tools and gain
an appreciation of their limits
so their perspective should include the
importance of the user interface
the impact of good
and bad user interface and the diversity
of user and application
so about methods and tools they should
know the trade-offs of design decision
involving different dialogue types and
input output device the information
resource
resources available for design the
benefit and cost of developing tools for
user interface implementation they need
to integrate training materials with the
user interface
the need to evaluate system usability
and information about some design and
evaluation tools
finally software engineers building user
interface must know the limits of their
knowledge when and how to work with
human partners engineers as a consultant
for design and evaluation
when and how to work with technical
writers for implementation of a system
of a user guidance when and how to work
a statistical consultant and the
difficulty of measuring measurement and
the complexity of making decision
decision-based data
user interface is the product
application view to which user interacts
in order to use the software
user can manipulate and control the
software as well as hardware by means of
user interface
today
user interface is found almost every
place where digital technology exists
right from the computers mobile phones
cars music players airplane ships and
more
so user interface is a part of software
and is designed such a way that is
expected to provide the user inside of
the software
a user interface or the ui
provides fundamental platform for human
computer interaction
so user interface can be a graphical
uh
it can be text based audio based
depending upon the underlying hardware
and software combination
so user interface can be hardware or
software or combination of both
okay so the software becomes more
popular in user interface it becomes
more attractive
simple to use
responsive in short time
and clear to understand
consistent at all interfacing screen
a bad
user interface design totally destroyed
the creativity behind the designers but
also deliver
delivers misunderstanding input to the
user
all of those altogether bring user a
sense of confusion for station and even
sometimes anger okay
again the the visibility and affordable
so visibility is what is seen
affordance is what operation and
manipulation can be done to a particular
project
so what is visible must have a good
mapping to their effect
and perceive a part of perceived
affordance what a person thinks can be
done to an object
again uh visibility
is the basic principle that
the more visible an element is the more
likely user will know about them and how
to use them
equally important in the opposite when
sometimes out of sight it's difficult to
know about the use as simple as this
principle it's simon struggle with
adopting it
and when we say accordance this is the
appearance of a specific control such as
function for example apply
okay when you see a floppy disk icon
so
this is uh this is just a save button
okay
so visibility the control is visible to
the user who they know it's available
okay and while accordance the image used
for the control
suggests its function
okay so visibility should be obvious
what a control used for
so for example if i press this button so
what will happen
if i want to unlock the door which
control should i use
a system with good visibility visibility
allows the user to easily translate
goals into
action
while affordance
it should be obvious how to control its
use okay so the system should provide a
strong clues to the operation of a thing
example a button upwards pushing a lever
uh upwards pulling so the user should
know how to operate or control just by
looking at it
okay
then
when you say feedback okay it should be
obvious when a controller has been used
so once the user has press a button okay
the system
should react in a manner that clearly
communicates what has just been
accomplished if nothing happened so this
part should be also obvious for example
when you say profile okay so there will
be a message that
your file is successfully seen
or you delete
so importance of hci hci will be
increasingly important in the following
areas
as a part of software development
process and system design methods
as a part of a future legal requirements
for software as a basis for a set of
usability criteria to evaluate and
choose from amongst competitive products
as the basis for successful marketing
strategy to the increasingly important
and important home and small business
user
hci is a very important because it will
be a fundamental to make product more
successful
safe useful and functional so in the
long run it will make more pleasurable
for the user
hence it's important to have someone
with hci focus skills involved in all
places of any product of a system
development
hci is also important to avoid product
or project going wrong or totally clear
so it's extremely important when
designing a clear inductive system which
be usable for people with a varied range
of abilities and expertise and who have
not completed any formal training
hci takes advantage of our everyday
knowledge of the world to make software
and devices more understandable and
usable for everyone for example using a
graphic of a miniature folder in a
computer interface helps the user
understand the power force of the folder
as everyone's experience with a real
paper called their day everyday life
so relationship of the hci to other
discipline
hci is a multidisciplinary field
so hci draws expertise from a number of
different areas of studies
only first we have prototyping
and
iterative development from a software
okay so a prototype is an early sample
model or release of a product build to
test a concept or process or to act as a
thing to be
applicated or learn from
it's a term used to a variety of
contexts including semantics design
electronics and software programming so
prototype is designed to test and try a
new design to enhance precision by a
system
analyst and a user
in prototyping it allows members of the
development team to clean confirm
whether the product interface can be
easily learned and use
so the goal for rapid prototyping
include conducting iterative testing and
revision in early product development
cycle so this approach allows user
testing to be integral part of a product
design
next we have a
software psychology and human factor
of computing system
okay so hci or the human computer
interaction study is a region of
intersection between psychology and the
social science
on the other hand the computer science
and technology and the other
hdi researchers analyze and design
specific user interface technologies for
example a pointing device so they study
and improve the process of the
technology development
so they develop and evaluate new
application of technology
throughout the past two decades the agi
has progressively integrated its
scientific concern with the engineering
goal of improving the usability of
computer system an application which has
resulted in a body of technical
knowledge and methodology
hcis continue to provide a challenging
test domain to applying developing
psychological and social jury in the
context of technology and development
and use
okay
next we have user interface of software
from computer graphics
an important part facet of hci is the
securing of user satisfaction or simply
end user computing satisfaction because
human computer interaction studies a
human and machine communication it grows
from supporting knowledge of both the
machine
and a human side
so poorly designed human machine
interface can lead to many honest
unexpected problems
the hci is very important because it
will be the fundamental to make a
product more successful
safe useful and
functional
so that's the model tourist and
framework from cognitive science
cognitive modeling is an area of
computer science that deal with
similarly simulating human problem
solving and mental processing in a
computerized model such a model can be
used to
simulate or predict human behavior or
performance and similar to other one's
models and improve human computer
interaction
uh human computer interaction is an
emerging branch of pupil computer
which is concerned with how people
interact with all the process
outwardly accessible information as a
worldwide web however it adapts
information centric approach rather than
computer setting approach to the field
of human computer interaction
like hci it's it's an application pill
that provides complex textbooks for
tourism of cognitive outrage
architecture
so it turns that shooters provide the
basis for cognitive engineering models
that can yield prediction about the
technology and
information design
okay so the topic in hci
is a user what or social organization
and what we have the youth or the user
to the application areas and the u3
which is the human machine pit
adaptation
okay
so computer exists uh with a larger
social organization
word menu
or the social organization work
so within this context there are
applications for which we wish to employ
computer system
which is the
application area
but the process of putting computer to
work means that the human technical and
work aspect of the application situation
must be brought into pit with each other
through human learning system
tailorability
or the other strategy
or the machine
human machine fit and adaptation
in addition to the use of social context
of computer on human side we must also
take into account the human information
processing
h1 the communication and the physical
and the characteristic of the user
on the computer side
a variety of technology has been
developed for supporting interaction
with human
input and output device connect the
human and the machine
so this use in the number of techniques
for organization dialogue
so these techniques are used in turns to
implement larger design elements such as
the metaport of the interface
so getting deeper into the machine
substrata supporting the dialogue the
dialogue
may make extensive use of computer
graphics techniques
complex dialogues lead into a
consideration of the system architecture
and necessary to support such feature
as interconnectable application program
we doing a real-time response network
communication multi-user and cooperative
interface and multi-tasking of a
dialogue objects
finally there is the process of
development which incomplete design
for human computer dialogue techniques
and tools for implementing the
techniques for evaluating them and the
number of classic design for the study
so again the question is what is human
computer interaction so the answer is
hci is the study and the practice of
usability
hci is the study of how people use
computer system to perform a certain
task
okay so this uh
hci is about the importance of human
computer
interaction
in the technology which increased
tremendously so the goal of hcis to
improve the interaction between the user
and the computer by making computer more
user friendly and receptive to the user
needs
hci is concerned with the methodologies
and processes for designing interface
and the methods of implementing
interfaces developing new interface and
interaction techniques a long-term goal
of hcis to design which minimize the
barrier between the human cognitive
models of what they want to accomplish
and the computer understanding of the
user tests okay so that's it for today
and thank you
