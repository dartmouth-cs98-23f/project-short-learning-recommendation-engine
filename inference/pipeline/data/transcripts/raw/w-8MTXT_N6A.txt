2.179,5.771,hello and welcome to a CAD guilds
4.859,4.681,tutorial on data science in this video
7.95,4.08,we will explain the difference between
9.54,4.86,three key concepts artificial
12.03,4.499,intelligence machine learning and deep
14.4,3.93,learning to understand how they relate
16.529,4.651,to the field of data science
18.33,6.6,first up artificial intelligence or AI
21.18,6.96,what is it artificial intelligence is
24.93,5.759,simply any code technique or algorithm
28.14,4.71,that enables machines to mimic develop
30.689,5.521,and demonstrate human cognition or
32.85,6.6,behavior we are in what many refer to as
36.21,5.759,the era of weak AI the technology is
39.45,4.83,still in its infancy and is expected to
41.969,4.651,make machines capable of doing anything
44.28,6.299,and everything humans do in the era of
46.62,6.63,strong AI to transition from weak AI to
50.579,4.8,strong AI machines need to learn the
53.25,4.8,ways of humans the techniques and
55.379,5.371,processes which help machines in this
58.05,5.04,endeavor are broadly categorized under
60.75,4.92,machine learning machines learn in
63.09,5.42,predominantly two ways their learning is
65.67,5.309,either supervised or unsupervised in
68.51,4.69,supervised learning machines learn to
70.979,4.89,predict outcomes with help from data
73.2,5.43,scientists in unsupervised learning
75.869,5.43,machines learn to predict outcomes on
78.63,5.55,the go by recognizing patterns in input
81.299,5.011,data when machines can draw meaningful
84.18,4.59,inferences from large volumes of data
86.31,5.099,sets they demonstrate the ability to
88.77,5.61,learn deeply deep learning requires
91.409,5.221,artificial neural networks pay and ends
94.38,4.71,which are like the biological neural
96.63,4.71,networks in humans these networks
99.09,4.139,contain nodes in different layers that
101.34,4.41,are connected and communicate with each
103.229,4.981,other to make sense of voluminous input
105.75,4.53,data deep learning is a subset of
108.21,4.619,machine learning which in turn is a
110.28,4.979,subset of artificial intelligence the
112.829,5.25,three technologies help scientists and
115.259,4.89,analysts interpret tons of data and are
118.079,4.411,hence crucial for the field of data
