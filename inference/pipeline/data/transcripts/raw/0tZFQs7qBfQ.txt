0.4,4.08,ray is a tech savvy guy and loves to
2.56,3.36,spend most of his time exploring the web
4.48,3.279,on his laptop
5.92,4.16,one fine day he was going through an
7.759,5.281,article on futuristic gadgets and
10.08,5.12,suddenly he noticed an ad for the ps5
13.04,3.68,popping right beside the article
15.2,3.28,he found it a little strange as he
16.72,3.12,recalled searching for that just a few
18.48,3.28,hours ago
19.84,3.84,later that day he came across some
21.76,4.08,suggestive ads popping up related to
23.68,5.12,buying future leading gadgets
25.84,4.8,and that is when he freaked out thinking
28.8,3.84,how can it be possible that what he was
30.64,4.24,searching for just a few hours or days
32.64,4.96,ago on the internet is now suggesting
34.88,4.4,ads related similar to them
37.6,4.24,so he thought of going to his elder
39.28,4.32,brother aaron who is a software engineer
41.84,4.08,in an mnc
43.6,4.56,upon understanding the situation
45.92,4.24,he explained to ray that all of this is
48.16,3.6,happening because we are in an era of
50.16,4.8,web 2.0
51.76,4.88,it all started in 1994 when web 1.0 was
54.96,4.64,introduced to the internet
56.64,5.28,basically web 1.0 was all read only
59.6,5.04,content that was not interactable and
61.92,6.239,was similar to a huge wikipedia page
64.64,5.12,but after a few years in 2004 web 2.0
68.159,3.841,came into the picture
69.76,4.399,web 2.0 made the internet much more
72.0,4.439,interactive because of developments in
74.159,6.241,web technologies such as javascript
76.439,5.801,html5 css3 and others which allowed
80.4,4.0,companies to create interactive web
82.24,4.72,platforms like youtube facebook
84.4,4.48,wikipedia and many more
86.96,4.32,he further added that when we seek out
88.88,4.72,information or data of any kind from any
91.28,4.879,web platforms present on the internet
93.6,4.64,simultaneously unknowingly we also
96.159,4.241,provide them with information related to
98.24,4.64,our choices and interests which are
100.4,4.399,stored in cookies which later they sell
102.88,4.4,to various companies who make use of
104.799,3.761,this data to advertise exactly what you
107.28,3.119,were looking for
108.56,4.239,and this is how ray was able to see ads
110.399,4.481,of his concerned interests
112.799,5.28,ray was fascinated by how the internet
114.88,5.279,has evolved and how it works amazingly
118.079,4.64,but at the same time he was concerned
120.159,5.121,about the lack of privacy offered by it
122.719,4.241,ray out of his concern asked aaron is
125.28,4.08,there any way that one can get rid of
126.96,4.56,the loopholes of the current web 2.0
129.36,4.64,when aaron answered yes there are a lot
131.52,4.56,of ways to do that using tor browser
134.0,4.48,incognito mode etc
136.08,4.0,but these are not permanent solutions
138.48,2.96,and there can be fluctuations in their
140.08,3.84,reliability
141.44,4.72,but this scenario can be changed not
143.92,5.52,just for you but for everyone using the
146.16,5.52,internet with the help of web 3.0
149.44,4.24,ray was curious about it and asked what
151.68,4.639,is web 3.0
153.68,4.88,erin explained that web 3.0 is the next
156.319,4.481,step in the evolution of the internet
158.56,4.16,allowing it to process data with near
160.8,4.079,human intelligence through the use of
162.72,3.44,artificial intelligence and blockchain
164.879,3.44,technologies
166.16,3.92,that run innovative programs to help
168.319,3.361,users by providing them with their
170.08,4.08,relevant choices
171.68,5.12,it's a significant step toward open
174.16,5.12,trusting and permissionless networks
176.8,4.88,aaron further added to fully comprehend
179.28,5.319,this we must first explore the four key
181.68,4.479,features of web 3.0 first is
184.599,3.56,decentralization
186.159,4.401,blockchain will help to centralize data
188.159,4.0,storage while also establishing trust in
190.56,3.92,the virtual world
192.159,4.641,because web 3.0 allows information to be
194.48,4.24,retrieved based on its content
196.8,3.6,it can be kept in several locations
198.72,3.68,simultaneously
200.4,4.16,making it decentralized this would
202.4,3.919,dismantle the vast databases currently
204.56,5.039,maintained by internet giants like
206.319,5.041,facebook now meta and google giving more
209.599,4.64,power over people
211.36,5.2,second is trustful and permissionless
214.239,3.92,web 3.0 will also be trustful and
216.56,3.44,permissionless which means that
218.159,4.0,participants will be able to interact
220.0,4.159,directly without the need for a trusted
222.159,4.881,intermediary or permission from a
224.159,5.201,governing body due to this you can
227.04,4.16,access any data relevant to your choice
229.36,4.879,without any permission from any other
231.2,5.039,node or third party for example
234.239,3.92,if you are researching for some data you
236.239,3.36,don't need to accept its cookies or you
238.159,3.521,don't need to provide any sort of
239.599,4.241,details as there is a trustful bond
241.68,4.16,between you and the web
243.84,3.28,third is artificial intelligence and
245.84,4.16,machine learning
247.12,5.28,in web 3.0 through technology based on
250.0,3.599,semantic web ideas and natural language
252.4,2.88,processing
253.599,3.681,computers will be able to understand the
255.28,3.04,information in the same way that people
257.28,4.239,do
258.32,6.08,for example i love paris and i heart
261.519,4.881,paris may seem different in syntax
264.4,4.16,however their semantics are nearly
266.4,4.0,identical this will help the user to
268.56,4.16,achieve more relevant content to their
270.4,4.4,choices and will provide them ease with
272.72,4.88,internet browsing
274.8,4.959,fourth is connectivity and ubiquity
277.6,5.039,in web 3.0 the internet will be
279.759,3.761,accessible to everyone anywhere at any
282.639,3.12,time
283.52,4.88,because iot internet of things
285.759,4.16,technology will launch in several new
288.4,3.359,smart devices
289.919,4.401,these internet connected devices will no
291.759,5.121,longer be limited to pcs and smartphones
294.32,5.04,as they were in web 2.0 understanding
296.88,4.72,the shortcomings of web 2.0 corporates
299.36,4.399,like amazon apple and google are
301.6,4.879,transforming their existing services
303.759,4.561,into internet 3.0 apps that abide by
306.479,3.761,these four principles
308.32,5.599,siri and wolfram alpha are two
310.24,5.6,applications that use web 3.0 features
313.919,4.401,after learning about this ray was
315.84,4.56,relieved by the fact that web 3.0 is
318.32,4.719,going to bring so much of a difference
320.4,4.88,not just in his life but also to the
323.039,4.481,society as a whole
325.28,5.6,so here's a question for you
327.52,4.16,how is web 3.0 related to blockchain
330.88,2.879,a
331.68,3.84,it helps create smart contracts for web
333.759,2.561,pages on the internet
335.52,3.2,b
336.32,3.68,it helps web 3.0 storage data in the
338.72,2.16,blockchain
340.0,2.96,c
340.88,3.599,it offers a decentralized experience to
342.96,2.56,its users
344.479,2.801,d
345.52,3.36,all of the above
347.28,3.12,please take a minute to think about it
348.88,3.68,and leave your answers in the comments
350.4,4.72,section below three lucky winners will
352.56,5.12,receive amazon gift vouchers
355.12,5.2,web 3.0 will offer a more personalized
357.68,4.239,and customized surfing experience and a
360.32,3.36,smarter and more human-like search
361.919,2.881,assistant and other decentralized
363.68,2.88,benefits
364.8,3.679,all of which are believed to contribute
366.56,3.759,to a more fair web
368.479,4.641,this will be accomplished by giving each
370.319,5.521,user control over their data resulting
373.12,5.04,in a richer overall experience
375.84,4.079,in a nutshell the internet will become
378.16,4.879,considerably more intertwined in our
379.919,5.201,daily lives when web 3.0 arrives
383.039,3.921,we hope you enjoyed this video if you
