0.04,5.0,we've all heard about Quantum Computing
2.32,4.64,but what is it really quantum computers
5.04,4.36,can process information at speeds that
6.96,4.0,are faster than traditional computers
9.4,3.68,making them capable of Performing
10.96,4.52,calculations that would take billions of
13.08,4.72,years on a conventional machine but
15.48,3.879,there's more watch the whole video folks
17.8,3.88,you will know everything about the
19.359,3.92,fascinating world of quantum Computing
21.68,3.2,and how this cuttingedge technology
23.279,3.801,could impact the development of
24.88,5.799,artificial intelligence let's get
27.08,5.359,started so what is quantum computing
30.679,3.761,Quantum Computing is about using the
32.439,3.681,principles of quantum theory which
34.44,3.959,describes the behavior of energy and
36.12,4.16,matter at the atomic and subatomic
38.399,4.16,levels to develop a new type of
40.28,4.24,computing you know rather than relying
42.559,4.601,on traditional binary encoding where
44.52,4.559,bits can either be zero or one Quantum
47.16,5.399,Computing harnesses the properties of
49.079,6.521,subatomic particles such as electrons or
52.559,5.081,photons to operate with Quantum bits or
55.6,4.08,cubits these cubits possess the
57.64,3.36,remarkable ability to exist in multiple
59.68,3.32,States States
61.0,5.52,simultaneously essentially embodying
63.0,5.04,both one and zero concurrently unlike
66.52,4.239,classical computers that encode
68.04,5.04,information through a binary system of
70.759,5.121,electrical impulses Quantum Computing
73.08,5.92,exploits phenomena in quantum physics to
75.88,5.4,revolutionize computation cubits the
79.0,4.2,fundamental units of quantum Computing
81.28,4.32,Define the binary constraints of
83.2,4.919,classical bits enabling to inhabit
85.6,4.4,multi-dimensional States consequently
88.119,4.801,the computational power of quantum
90.0,5.52,computers scales exponentially with the
92.92,4.76,addition of more cubits far surpassing
95.52,5.279,the linear growth of classical computers
97.68,4.84,as they increase in bit capacity the
100.799,4.241,Inception of quantum Computing dates
102.52,4.08,back to the 1980s when researchers
105.04,3.52,discovered that certain computational
106.6,4.559,challenges could be more efficiently
108.56,5.36,addressed using Quantum algorithms than
111.159,5.0,classical methods this Cutting Edge
113.92,4.6,technology holds immense potential in
116.159,6.041,navigating vast arrays of possibilities
118.52,5.68,to discern Solutions to complex problems
122.2,4.519,now at the heart of quantum computing's
124.2,5.039,incredible power lie two fundamental
126.719,5.121,principles from quantum physics
129.239,4.481,superposition and entanglement
131.84,4.0,superposition enables cubits to hold
133.72,4.84,Quantum information in a state
135.84,4.679,encompassing all possible configurations
138.56,4.36,simultaneously Paving the way for the
140.519,3.641,creation of intricate multi-dimensional
142.92,4.12,computational
144.16,4.92,spaces think of flipping a coin in our
147.04,5.199,world it's either heads or tails once it
149.08,5.4,lands but in Quantum superposition it's
152.239,5.0,as if the coin is spinning in the air
154.48,5.32,both heads and tails at once until you
157.239,4.961,check this means a quantum computer can
159.8,4.92,consider multiple outcomes at the same
162.2,5.319,time vastly speeding up its ability to
164.72,5.159,solve complex problems entanglement on
167.519,4.72,the other hand allows pairs of cubits to
169.879,4.601,become interconnected in such a manner
172.239,4.321,that the state of one cubit directly
174.48,4.32,influences the state of the other
176.56,5.36,facilitating predictable correlations
178.8,5.159,between them by harnessing superposition
181.92,4.44,cubits can explore a multitude of
183.959,4.241,potential Solutions at the same time
186.36,4.4,vastly expanding the computational
188.2,4.84,landscape furthermore entanglement
190.76,4.839,empowers Quantum algorithms to tackle
193.04,4.64,complex Problems by exploiting the
195.599,4.36,interconnectedness between cubits
197.68,5.32,leading to exponential enhancements in
199.959,5.481,computing power and efficiency in
203.0,4.12,contrast to classical computers where
205.44,3.6,increasing bit capacity yields
207.12,4.479,incremental improvements in processing
209.04,5.08,power the addition of cubits to a
211.599,5.28,quantum computer results in exponential
214.12,4.64,advancements in computational capacity
216.879,4.041,adding to that you should also know that
218.76,4.679,classical computers excel at everyday
220.92,4.64,tasks with minimal error rates while
223.439,5.201,quantum computers offer unparallel
225.56,5.52,capabilities for complex tasks like
228.64,4.64,simulations data analysis such as
231.08,4.719,chemical or drug trials and designing
233.28,5.08,energy efficient batteries albeit with
235.799,4.401,higher error rates you know unlike
238.36,4.28,classical computers which typically
240.2,5.2,require basic cooling mechanisms like
242.64,5.0,internal fans Quantum processors demand
245.4,4.6,meticulous protection from even the
247.64,4.439,slightest vibrations and must operate at
250.0,5.2,extremely low temperatures using super
252.079,5.921,cooled super fluids interestingly in a
255.2,4.999,landmark achievement in 2019 Google was
258.0,4.12,able to prove that a quantum computer
260.199,4.041,could solve a problem within minutes
262.12,5.799,that would take a classical computer
264.24,5.56,"10,000 years to solve as of today Google"
267.919,5.201,is investing billions of dollars in into
269.8,5.32,building its quantum computer by 2029

442.16,4.4,back in the increasing interest in
444.36,4.08,Quantum Computing is evident with the

456.96,4.6,transformative technology by
459.24,4.04,2025 well people which industry do you
461.56,5.039,think will be the most transformed by
463.28,6.359,Quantum Computing and more importantly
466.599,6.401,why limitations of quantum
469.639,5.96,Computing so decoherence is basically
473.0,4.68,the ailles heal of quantum Computing it
475.599,4.16,means everything can go haywi with the
477.68,4.199,smallest changes in the cubits
479.759,4.12,surroundings imagine trying to solve a
481.879,5.241,puzzle while someone keeps jostling the
483.879,4.76,table yeah not exactly the best is it
487.12,4.0,this vulnerability means quantum
488.639,4.801,computers must operate in isolation
491.12,4.44,shielded from any external interference
493.44,5.599,akin to the delicate inner workings of a
495.56,5.4,Swiss watch but uh far more complex
499.039,4.361,error correction is another hurdle on
500.96,4.72,the quantum track in the digital realm
503.4,4.6,when a bit flips it's a straightforward
505.68,4.359,fix but in the quantum world where
508.0,4.64,cubits dance to a different from beat
510.039,4.321,errors are a trickier Affair current
512.64,4.0,error correction methods struggle to
514.36,4.479,keep Pace with the quantum Jitterbug
516.64,4.319,leaving computations potentially
518.839,5.08,unreliable like trying to navigate
520.959,4.921,through a fog with a faulty Compass
523.919,3.881,despite these obstacles strides are
525.88,4.399,being made in algorithms designed to
527.8,4.719,mitigate errors and enhance accuracy of
530.279,4.441,quantum computations for instance
532.519,4.44,specific database search algorithms show
534.72,5.28,Promise by leveraging Quantum properties
536.959,5.281,to yield correct answers even amid
540.0,4.399,decoherence another area of focus is
542.24,4.48,quantum cryptography which aims to
544.399,4.161,harness Quantum properties for secure
546.72,4.119,communication while still under
548.56,4.24,development Quantum cryptography holds
550.839,4.481,the potential to revolutionize data
552.8,5.279,security by leveraging the principles of
555.32,5.519,quantum mechanics but perhaps the
558.079,4.841,biggest hurdle of all is the lack of
560.839,3.961,cubits to unleash the full power of
562.92,3.44,quantum Computing researchers strive to
564.8,4.56,increase the number of cubits beyond the
566.36,6.28,current threshold which stands at around
569.36,4.68,28 cubits moreover the environmental
572.64,3.199,conditions required for Quantum
574.04,4.12,Computing add another layer of
575.839,4.361,complexity quantum computers demand
578.16,3.919,ultra low temperatures and highly
580.2,3.8,controlled environments to maintain
582.079,4.121,Cubit stability and prevent data
584.0,4.44,corruption achieving and maintaining
586.2,4.6,such conditions present significant
588.44,4.399,engineering challenges but are essential
590.8,4.32,for the success of quantum Computing
