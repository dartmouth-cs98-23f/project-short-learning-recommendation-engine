0.03,6.21,hello in this video we will learn more
3.12,5.58,about relational databases there are
6.24,7.649,many popular relational databases like
8.7,7.53,MySQL SQL Server oracle sybase etc in a
13.889,4.861,relational database the data is stored
16.23,5.969,in multiple tables that are linked by a
18.75,6.3,common field a table is also called as a
22.199,5.941,relation and is a data set that is
25.05,5.46,organized into rows and columns for
28.14,4.77,example this table has the information
30.51,5.67,about student and this one has
32.91,6.0,information about customers each row in
36.18,5.64,this table is called as record or tuple
38.91,6.419,which represents one complete unit of
41.82,6.09,information so in our example here each
45.329,5.671,row has information about one student
47.91,5.76,only columns are also called as fees or
51.0,5.399,attributes which contain one type of
53.67,5.22,information the number of columns or
56.399,5.16,attributes is called as degree of the
58.89,5.909,relation for example the degree of this
61.559,5.761,table is 3 similarly the number of rows
64.799,5.191,or tuples in a table is called as
67.32,6.6,cardinality of the relation in this
69.99,6.93,example here the cardinality is 4 let's
73.92,4.92,quickly take a look at some questions in
76.92,5.129,this table what is the degree and
78.84,6.9,cardinality of the table degree is 2 and
82.049,5.521,cardinality is fine another example in
85.74,5.25,this table what is the degree and
87.57,6.659,cardinality degrees 4 and cardinality is
90.99,6.12,3 now in a database one of the key
94.229,5.82,concept is to be able to identify each
97.11,5.789,row or tuple unity let's take this
100.049,5.46,student data as an example now when I
102.899,4.951,want to enter marks these two students
105.509,2.82,have same info so which one should I
107.85,3.9,update
108.329,5.82,that's where Keys help us typically a
111.75,4.649,table has one column or field which
114.149,4.981,uniquely identifies the records in the
116.399,5.341,table this field is called as primary
119.13,4.769,key when a database is designed or
121.74,4.68,created in a table we search for
123.899,5.071,attributes which uniquely identify a row
126.42,4.53,there could be more than one attribute
128.97,4.65,like that and they our fault as
130.95,5.52,candidate keys means they all are
133.62,5.49,candidate to be the primary team out of
136.47,5.13,these candidate keys one is selected as
139.11,4.98,primary key and remaining are called
141.6,4.41,as ultimate keys it is very much
144.09,5.04,possible that these keys are actually
146.01,5.82,combination of attributes for example I
149.13,6.06,can use name plus surname as combination
151.83,6.3,which will uniquely identify a room then
155.19,5.94,the heat is called as composite key now
158.13,5.34,many databases have multiple tables how
161.13,4.92,are they linked with each other they are
163.47,5.04,linked through foreign key a foreign key
166.05,5.13,is a field that references the primary
168.51,5.64,key of another table let's take this
171.18,5.76,example we have a student table and then
174.15,5.16,we have a result table the student table
176.94,4.89,has a list of all students that are
179.31,5.25,there in the class all the results of
181.83,5.129,students are in the result table rule
184.56,4.08,number is the primary key and the result
186.959,4.951,table has a foreign key role number
188.64,5.22,which links it to the student table this
191.91,5.16,is the foreign key which references the
193.86,4.77,primary key in another table in our next
197.07,4.139,video we are going to learn more about
198.63,3.15,SQL and how we can manipulate these
201.209,7.661,tables
