6.049,4.241,hello everybody and welcome back I'm
8.91,3.33,going to apologize right now for this
10.29,4.469,long introduction but what I'm trying to
12.24,5.28,do in this video is teach you software
14.759,4.53,design at a very fundamental level so
17.52,2.79,I've heard you guys loud and clear a lot
19.289,2.851,of you are sick of the beginner
20.31,3.75,tutorials you're sick of people assuming
22.14,3.479,you know nothing and you want to get
24.06,3.09,more into the intermediate and advanced
25.619,3.841,level you want to figure out how do I
27.15,4.35,design software how do I look at some
29.46,3.39,system some program and come up with
31.5,3.87,some kind of plan some kind of
32.85,4.049,implementation approach or strategy that
35.37,3.24,is exactly what I'm gonna be showing you
36.899,4.021,here so on the left hand side of my
38.61,4.109,screen you can see that we have this
40.92,3.479,kind of mock software system that I've
42.719,3.421,just come up with this completely random
44.399,3.541,example that I just wrote up before this
46.14,4.23,video and what we're gonna be doing is
47.94,4.17,looking at this block of text here which
50.37,3.18,you can really think of as the client
52.11,3.12,you can think of is this is what the
53.55,3.599,client wants this is what the person
55.23,4.379,you're writing code for wants how do you
57.149,4.351,take simply these four paragraphs here
59.609,3.781,and translate that into a fully
61.5,3.54,functioning software system that is
63.39,3.24,exactly what we're gonna be doing here
65.04,3.119,so we're gonna look through this we're
66.63,3.93,gonna go through the process of picking
68.159,4.021,up valuable information and then what
70.56,4.26,we're gonna do is actually draw up a
72.18,4.53,class diagram that has what our plan is
74.82,3.99,going to be when we start implementing
76.71,4.17,this and that leads me to my next point
78.81,4.05,which is planning when you want to get
80.88,3.39,out of that intermediate or you want to
82.86,3.36,move from kind of intermediate to more
84.27,3.57,advanced you already know how to program
86.22,3.96,the next step is thinking about
87.84,4.11,designing programs designing software
90.18,3.6,it's not enough to be good at
91.95,3.75,programming what you need to do is
93.78,4.35,actually be able to think about the kind
95.7,4.32,of overarching architecture of the
98.13,3.809,program that you're writing you want to
100.02,3.779,think of okay how are these objects
101.939,4.081,these classes this system going to
103.799,4.051,interact with other things and how can I
106.02,4.05,think about all of these things before I
107.85,4.62,actually start writing code that is what
110.07,4.14,we are going to be doing here so without
112.47,3.12,further ado let's go ahead and get
114.21,3.299,started I'm gonna read through this
115.59,3.419,design problem here there will be a link
117.509,2.97,in the description if you prefer to read
119.009,3.691,through that yourself I would encourage
120.479,3.93,all of you before I go ahead and start
122.7,3.57,doing all of this for you and showing it
124.409,3.57,to you that you think about how you
126.27,3.39,might design something that looks like
127.979,3.601,this and if you were immediate thought
129.66,3.45,as I have no idea then while this video
131.58,2.19,is going to be perfect for you because
133.11,3.48,I'm going to
133.77,5.34,show you exactly how we can do this so
136.59,4.74,let's go ahead and read through this so
139.11,4.08,the problem I've had here is a design
141.33,3.33,problem tech with Tim school of
143.19,3.0,programmers so I just kind of made this
144.66,3.69,name up I thought it would make sense I
146.19,3.84,assume a lot of you guys are students or
148.35,3.57,you were at one point a student so I
150.03,4.47,think this will relate to a lot of you
151.92,4.29,and the idea here is that the tech with
154.5,3.48,Tim school of programmers needs a new
156.21,4.08,system to track all of its students
157.98,3.69,professors and courses so think of this
160.29,2.91,as some kind of like you know mini
161.67,3.39,University or something and they want a
163.2,3.57,system or a database or something like
165.06,3.87,that where they can track all of this
166.77,3.93,information maybe they can ask some type
168.93,3.72,of questions about a student they can
170.7,4.08,check grades they can see who's teaching
172.65,3.57,a course that's what this really is so
174.78,3.18,we'll go through the details here but it
176.22,3.39,wants to keep track of what courses are
177.96,3.36,offered who teaches each course and
179.61,3.27,which students are enrolled in those
181.32,3.18,courses it what else would like to be
182.88,3.75,able to track the grades of each of its
184.5,3.9,students across all courses for each
186.63,3.6,student and professor the school needs
188.4,4.11,to know their address phone number and H
190.23,5.49,so immediately even in just this first
192.51,4.65,paragraph this has told us a lot we need
195.72,2.97,a system right because we're just
197.16,3.03,thinking about what is it that we
198.69,3.0,actually need from the system these are
200.19,3.66,really the requirements that are being
201.69,3.69,listed out here and this system needs to
203.85,3.45,keep track of students it needs to keep
205.38,4.05,track of professors and it needs to keep
207.3,4.26,track of courses what else doesn't need
209.43,3.72,to keep track of well for each person we
211.56,3.66,need their address their phone number
213.15,3.57,their name and their age so let's keep
215.22,4.05,that in mind we'll read through the rest
216.72,4.62,and then we'll distill all of this ok so
219.27,3.81,each course has a maximum and minimum
221.34,4.11,number of students that they can enroll
223.08,4.5,if the minimum number of students is not
225.45,4.08,reached then the course will be canceled
227.58,4.11,each course is taught by at least one
229.53,4.02,professor but sometimes may be taught by
231.69,3.66,many so in some situations there may be
233.55,4.62,more than one professor that teaches the
235.35,4.56,course all right professors are salaried
238.17,3.45,employees at the tech with Tim School of
239.91,3.299,programmers and therefore we need to
241.62,3.839,keep track of how much they make each
243.209,4.021,year if a professor teaches more than
245.459,4.681,four courses in a semester they are
247.23,3.24,"granted a one-time bonus of $20,000 all"
250.14,3.21,right
250.47,4.59,students can both can be both local or
253.35,3.569,international students and full or
255.06,3.12,part-time a student is considered a
256.919,3.811,part-time student if they are enrolled
258.18,4.5,in less than one or two courses during
260.73,3.36,any given semester so actually sorry
262.68,3.85,this should say if they are enrolled in
264.09,3.82,one or two courses during any given
266.53,2.97,semester so essentially you are
267.91,4.35,part-time if you were taking two or less
269.5,4.38,courses in a semester the maximum amount
272.26,4.05,of courses a student may be enrolled in
273.88,4.11,at one time is six students receive
276.31,4.44,grades from each course these grades are
277.99,4.29,numeric in in the range of 0 to 100 any
280.75,4.2,students that have an above-average
282.28,4.62,grade across our have an average grade
284.95,3.9,sorry across all enrolled courses that
286.9,4.41,are lower than 60% is said to be on
288.85,4.11,academic probation so I apologize for
291.31,4.41,butchering butchering some of that
292.96,4.89,speech there but the idea here is we
295.72,3.36,have this system it's fairly simple we
297.85,3.15,need to keep track of students
299.08,4.08,professors those students grades across
301.0,4.35,all of the courses there's a few small
303.16,3.509,nuances within that but this should be
305.35,2.819,something that we're gonna be able to
306.669,3.691,design and hopefully in the next you
308.169,3.421,know 30 45 minutes with me explaining
310.36,3.9,everything that I'm doing
311.59,5.52,so given this block right given this
314.26,5.13,text what we need to do now is translate
317.11,3.869,this into a program and the first thing
319.39,3.48,that I want to do is start thinking
320.979,4.111,about all the information that I
322.87,4.62,actually need to track and all of the
325.09,4.68,potential classes I'm going to have in
327.49,4.14,my UML class diagram so we're gonna
329.77,4.05,design this using an object-oriented
331.63,4.349,style which is very common and what most
333.82,3.78,people kind of do and this doesn't
335.979,3.331,necessarily mean that what I'm gonna
337.6,4.02,design here will be the final
339.31,4.229,implementation that we actually program
341.62,4.44,up this is just kind of the thing that
343.539,4.411,is you know our design this is what we
346.06,3.78,thought this is our plan it's totally
347.95,2.339,fine if we decide to deviate from this
349.84,2.73,later
350.289,4.111,especially if other things come up but
352.57,3.84,we should at least have some kind of
354.4,3.389,idea of what we want to do then we can
356.41,4.14,follow about when we actually start
357.789,4.38,coding so what I'm gonna do is have two
360.55,3.33,windows here one on the left one on the
362.169,3.75,right and I'm going to start listing
363.88,4.47,first of all all of the classes that I
365.919,4.351,think we should actually have based on
368.35,3.87,the information I've seen here and this
370.27,4.08,is kind of the first step think about
372.22,4.71,all of the objects you might have in a
374.35,4.92,system all of the main components that
376.93,4.16,might have information within them so
379.27,4.32,the first thing I'm gonna list here is
381.09,4.21,students right we will probably have a
383.59,3.78,student class because we're gonna have
385.3,5.4,multiple students the next thing we're
387.37,4.77,probably gonna have is well professors
390.7,3.0,now I don't know if that's how you spell
392.14,3.12,professors but and we'll put that there
393.7,3.06,so we're gonna have a student class and
395.26,3.45,a professor class because we're gonna
396.76,2.58,need both a student and a professor and
398.71,2.489,this
399.34,3.96,has different information contained in
401.199,4.081,it than the professor dis awesome
403.3,4.35,alright so student professor next thing
405.28,3.81,we need is probably a course right we're
407.65,3.12,gonna have different courses those are
409.09,3.15,gonna be taught by professors and those
410.77,3.75,are gonna be taught by students and
412.24,3.45,after reading this are not taught by
414.52,3.149,students or I students will be enrolled
415.69,4.41,in that course and after reading this
417.669,4.261,first paragraph that is kind of what
420.1,3.18,I've grabbed from that so I've said okay
421.93,3.03,we need to keep track of students
423.28,3.18,professors and courses all we need to
424.96,3.45,see what courses are offered who teaches
426.46,4.5,the course who's enrolled keep track of
428.41,4.41,grades okay so that mate brings me to
430.96,4.41,grades so now I need to keep track of
432.82,3.87,greats how am I gonna do that well we'll
435.37,3.18,keep moving and then we'll think about
436.69,3.42,how that's gonna happen so each course
438.55,2.91,has a maximum and minimum number of
440.11,2.67,students that can enroll if the minimum
441.46,3.24,number of students has not reached in
442.78,3.449,that course will be canceled each course
444.7,3.18,is taught by at least one professor but
446.229,3.241,sometimes taught by many okay so that
447.88,3.69,doesn't give me any more classes I don't
449.47,3.78,think right now at least and let's keep
451.57,3.12,going professors are salaried employees
453.25,2.61,at Tech with Tim schooled programmer and
454.69,3.03,therefore we need to keep track of how
455.86,3.75,much they make a year okay that doesn't
457.72,4.38,says say anything to me students can be
459.61,3.99,both local or international a student is
462.1,2.43,considered a part-time student if
463.6,3.539,they're enrolled there one or two
464.53,5.16,courses during any given semester that
467.139,4.411,the duh duh okay and now after reading
469.69,3.39,all of this what I've determined is we
471.55,3.33,have student we have professor we have
473.08,3.72,course the only thing we're really
474.88,4.02,missing here is a way of keeping track
476.8,4.17,of who is enrolled in what course and
478.9,4.769,what grades each of these students have
480.97,5.1,so what I'm actually going to do is I'm
483.669,4.141,going to make a class called enroll now
486.07,3.659,this is gonna seem weird but what this
487.81,3.63,enroll class is going to do for us and
489.729,3.781,it will make more sense as we go through
491.44,5.19,this video is essentially link our
493.51,5.129,students and our courses so essentially
496.63,3.99,we have a way to say ok this course is
498.639,5.191,taught by this professor and this
500.62,5.31,student is enrolled in this course the
503.83,4.05,reason I want this enroll is because
505.93,4.35,this enroll will essentially tell me if
507.88,4.11,first of all if this course is active
510.28,3.03,right you know is there enough people in
511.99,2.76,this course that this student this
513.31,3.029,enrollment was successful that's
514.75,3.779,something we could keep track of on the
516.339,4.741,in rural class and it can keep track of
518.529,4.56,the grade that the student had in the
521.08,4.23,course we need some way to keep track of
523.089,4.291,all of the grades for all of the courses
525.31,4.529,for all of the students and this enroll
527.38,4.56,class could be a way to do this now keep
529.839,2.831,in mind that I might change this as we
531.94,2.17,go through and
532.67,3.33,I start drawing things out it might make
534.11,3.75,more sense to do something else but this
536.0,3.51,is my initial idea and this is where I'm
537.86,2.94,starting from this is my starting ground
539.51,2.88,and this is what I'm thinking about
540.8,3.6,right now and this is what you should
542.39,3.42,think about when you are reading some
544.4,1.95,requirements that look something like
545.81,2.67,this
546.35,3.81,okay so I've settled on these four
548.48,3.39,classes for right now these could change
550.16,4.08,again I'm trying to walk you through the
551.87,3.99,process as fully as we can so you really
554.24,2.91,understand and these are the four
555.86,3.39,classes that I think I'm gonna need
557.15,4.5,student-professor course and this enroll
559.25,4.05,one is gonna link those courses and
561.65,3.45,those students together and store some
563.3,3.24,information and it may be like the date
565.1,4.26,we enrolled in the course something like
566.54,3.93,that okay so now that I have that what
569.36,2.76,I'm gonna do is I'm gonna spread these
570.47,4.05,out and I'm gonna start listing
572.12,6.96,information that I need to keep track of
574.52,5.94,for students professors and so on so now
579.08,3.09,what I'm gonna do is start looking at
580.46,4.14,what information do I need for students
582.17,4.56,so down here it says a student can be
584.6,3.51,both local or international full or
586.73,4.47,part-time so the first thing I'm gonna
588.11,5.64,say is we'll say local and that will be
591.2,4.71,a boolean value that's either gonna be
593.75,4.08,true or false is this student local or
595.91,5.72,are they not and in fact what I actually
597.83,3.8,might make this is just international
601.84,2.98,international I think that's right and
603.68,3.33,this will just tell me if the students
604.82,3.6,international or not and that will tell
607.01,3.06,me if they're local right because it's a
608.42,3.99,true or false value so we'll keep that
610.07,4.14,as an attribute of my student class
612.41,3.51,that's some type of information we're
614.21,3.5,gonna need to know and then it says the
615.92,4.89,student can either be full or part-time
617.71,4.63,okay so we could consider that to be an
620.81,3.96,attribute of the student whether they're
622.34,4.62,full or part-time but how is that
624.77,3.66,attribute derived that is derived based
626.96,3.9,on the number of courses that they're
628.43,4.2,enrolled in during a given semester so
630.86,3.09,instead of making this an attribute what
632.63,3.09,I'm actually gonna do is say well
633.95,3.87,something that I need on my student is
635.72,5.94,gonna be a method and the method is
637.82,5.7,gonna say is part-time and this will
641.66,3.78,simply return a boolean and what this
643.52,3.69,will do is it will look at this student
645.44,3.45,and tell me how many courses are
647.21,4.41,enrolled in and if it is greater than
648.89,4.02,the threshold of the part-time student
651.62,3.09,then they will not be a part-time
652.91,3.87,student right that is what this method
654.71,3.96,will do so things that we start thinking
656.78,3.42,about is how are we gonna implement this
658.67,3.54,kind of attribute well we're gonna do
660.2,4.59,that using a method so we can determine
662.21,4.049,if a student is full or part-time okay
664.79,3.06,so the maximum an amount
666.259,4.29,courses a student may be enrolled in is
667.85,5.909,six students receive grades okay and
670.549,5.73,then what else does it say here if the
673.759,3.66,average grade is lower than 60% they're
676.279,3.691,on academic probation
677.419,4.86,so this one is derived from their grades
679.97,3.809,so again since it is a derived attribute
682.279,3.6,it's not simply just something that's
683.779,5.16,going to sit there what I need to do is
685.879,5.87,have a method that tells me hey are they
688.939,6.87,on probation so we'll say is on
691.749,5.62,probation like that alright so we'll put
695.809,3.24,that there and then this will be boolean
697.369,3.69,and what these methods are intending to
699.049,4.89,do is to look at attributes on the
701.059,4.95,student evaluate them and then give us
703.939,3.721,an answer to give us these kind of
706.009,3.87,attitudes right are they part-time or
707.66,3.779,are they on probation okay so now that
709.879,3.27,we have that let's move to Professor
711.439,3.33,don't worry there's a lot more stuff
713.149,3.9,that I'm gonna add in here but I want to
714.769,4.86,talk about that later so professor what
717.049,4.23,do we need here well a professor we need
719.629,4.2,to keep track of their salaries so first
721.279,4.71,thing we'll say is salary and this will
723.829,3.09,be a number right we're an int or
725.989,2.07,whatever you want to call it well
726.919,2.4,actually probably would be a float
728.059,4.02,because they could have a decimal point
729.319,4.98,salary so we'll put a salad right there
732.079,3.78,what else do we need for a professor
734.299,3.24,well there's nothing else on here that
735.859,3.51,it really says we need other than their
737.539,3.75,age name phone number etc which we'll
739.369,4.59,get to in a second so for that I'm gonna
741.289,3.931,leave it there now of course what do we
743.959,3.3,need for a course well it doesn't
745.22,4.049,specifically say there's anything we
747.259,3.24,really need for a course but what I'm
749.269,3.18,gonna have for a course of course
750.499,3.42,is the name I'm gonna have the course
752.449,3.6,code because that's something that we're
753.919,5.551,probably gonna need the name will be a
756.049,5.31,string the code will be a string as well
759.47,3.929,actually and then what else do we need
761.359,3.75,we need be minimum and maximum amount of
763.399,4.73,students in the course we'll save min
765.109,6.48,students that'll be an int and we'll say
768.129,5.14,max students and that will be an int and
771.589,3.75,then what I'm actually gonna have is
773.269,4.35,well we need to determine is this course
775.339,3.99,active or is it canceled so is this
777.619,4.83,going on do we have enough students in
779.329,4.56,this course for it to happen so what are
782.449,4.71,we gonna do we're gonna add a method
783.889,5.73,that says is active or will say is
787.159,3.84,canceled just because that goes more
789.619,3.42,with the requirements that we have there
790.999,4.8,so we'll say is canceled boolean and
793.039,4.32,what this will do is look at all of the
795.799,3.761,students enrolled in this course and
797.359,4.39,tell us if there is enough so
799.56,4.259,it's canceled or it's not canceled right
801.749,3.991,I hope that makes sense okay so we have
803.819,4.111,student we have professor we have course
805.74,3.93,another thing that I'm thinking we might
807.93,3.889,want to do is have something like the
809.67,4.469,start time for this course it doesn't
811.819,4.57,necessarily say that we need that but if
814.139,3.901,I'm thinking about my program in the
816.389,3.57,future it probably makes sense to have
818.04,3.599,something like start time right like
819.959,3.24,when did this course start what you
821.639,3.51,might want to keep track of it so we'll
823.199,3.45,say start and we'll say that's a date
825.149,3.0,and then while we're at that we might as
826.649,3.48,well put an end as well and we'll say
828.149,3.451,that that's gonna be a date - so
830.129,2.82,hopefully you get the idea that what I'm
831.6,3.27,doing is just going through and picking
832.949,3.781,out all the necessary information and
834.87,3.6,just listing it out so I can see it
836.73,3.75,before I actually start drawing anything
838.47,5.039,so we have student professor course and
840.48,5.37,then we have enroll okay so enroll what
843.509,4.14,do I need for enroll well this is gonna
845.85,5.219,keep track of how my students are
847.649,4.951,enrolled in courses so for enroll what
851.069,4.32,I'm gonna do is I'm simply gonna say
852.6,4.589,date so we'll literally say the date is
855.389,4.231,gonna be a date so this is when this
857.189,4.62,happened so when did they enroll we're
859.62,4.38,gonna need what students enrolled what
861.809,5.13,course enrolled and then we're also
864.0,5.459,going to need B grade that the student
866.939,3.991,got in that course this for me is pretty
869.459,3.541,much gonna keep track of hey this
870.93,4.079,student is enrolled in this course and
873.0,4.139,this is the grade that they received in
875.009,3.93,this course and that will be a float and
877.139,3.721,then anything else that we might want to
878.939,4.111,keep track of that's specific between a
880.86,4.32,student and a course but doesn't make
883.05,4.079,sense to go in just the student or just
885.18,4.079,the course would be information we put
887.129,3.51,in enroll and for now I don't think of
889.259,3.3,anything so I'm gonna leave it like this
890.639,5.13,and this is kind of the core information
892.559,5.97,I need except for this address phone
895.769,5.04,number name and age now the reason I've
898.529,5.1,left this out is because these are gonna
900.809,5.22,require some more classes notice that
903.629,4.591,for both a student and a professor we
906.029,3.961,have some shared functionality here we
908.22,3.419,have some shared attributes we have the
909.99,3.659,address the phone number the name and
911.639,4.2,the age so what I'm actually going to do
913.649,4.081,is I'm gonna make another class here I'm
915.839,3.87,gonna call it person and what this
917.73,4.049,person class is gonna represent is a
919.709,4.17,base class for both the student and the
921.779,3.66,professor so the student the professor
923.879,3.51,have some shared things that we want to
925.439,4.561,know about them so let's put that into a
927.389,4.95,base class that I'm gonna call person so
930.0,2.899,inside of person what I'm gonna do here
932.339,1.97,is
932.899,3.271,say okay what do we need well we need
934.309,4.921,the name so actually we're gonna have to
936.17,5.159,say first name oops if we could type
939.23,5.549,here so first name that'll be a string
941.329,6.391,we're gonna say last name that will be a
944.779,4.98,string as well what else do we need we
947.72,4.919,need the age of this person so do I do
949.759,4.62,age int like that I'm gonna ask you as a
952.639,3.45,question here I can't really because
954.379,4.14,it's not an interactive environment but
956.089,4.261,think about if this age makes sense to
958.519,3.391,put here does it make sense to have an
960.35,2.82,attribute called age because we want to
961.91,3.239,keep track of the age right it says we
963.17,4.109,need the age in this person class so
965.149,3.72,think about it for a second okay I'm
967.279,3.09,assuming you've thought about it and I'm
968.869,4.111,gonna tell you right now that it makes
970.369,5.46,no sense to put an attribute called age
972.98,5.159,which is an int the reason you never put
975.829,4.771,an attribute called age on something is
978.139,5.73,because an age changes and guess what an
980.6,5.07,age is derived from your birthdate so on
983.869,3.96,the current date versus your birth date
985.67,4.289,that determines your age so rather than
987.829,5.31,keeping track of the age we want to keep
989.959,6.031,track of the date of birth which will
993.139,4.29,tell us the age right we can very easily
995.99,3.36,find the age if we have the date of
997.429,3.27,birth so this is gonna be a date so that
999.35,2.909,was a little bit of a trick I put in
1000.699,3.721,there just to see if I could fool you
1002.259,4.56,guys okay next thing we need is a phone
1004.42,5.099,number so let's say phone number if we
1006.819,5.281,can do this like this so phone number
1009.519,4.651,and that is gonna be a what is this I
1012.1,3.39,guess we could call it I'm gonna call it
1014.17,4.2,a string just because we can have like
1015.49,4.889,the plus one - yada yada yada
1018.37,3.6,there might be a specific attribute we
1020.379,3.601,could use for that but a string it's
1021.97,4.439,fine I think you guys get that all right
1023.98,4.859,now we need B address so what is it in
1026.409,4.951,address comprised of though is my
1028.839,4.35,question here these address really an
1031.36,4.38,attribute that I can put can I just put
1033.189,5.13,a dress like that well the answer is yes
1035.74,4.349,you can do that but what I usually like
1038.319,4.531,to do just to make things easier for
1040.089,3.99,myself in the future is make a separate
1042.85,3.209,class called
1044.079,4.32,address and it stores all of the
1046.059,4.681,information in separate fields about the
1048.399,5.041,address so this way I can very easily
1050.74,4.35,grab information from the address I can
1053.44,3.839,sort by people that are living in a
1055.09,3.48,certain area it just makes things a lot
1057.279,3.12,easier especially if you're thinking
1058.57,3.989,about a database structure in the future
1060.399,4.02,if you have a bunch of attributes that
1062.559,3.721,could be squished in one separate out
1064.419,4.081,into individual fields
1066.28,4.17,let's look at this address what is an
1068.5,4.2,address well we need a country we need
1070.45,4.14,kind of a state or a province I'll just
1072.7,3.27,call it a state but like it could be a
1074.59,4.05,province that might make more sense
1075.97,5.7,we're going to need a street
1078.64,4.65,we'll need a street number so we could
1081.67,3.96,call this the street address and that
1083.29,5.49,could be one thanks we need country
1085.63,5.49,states we're going to need a city we
1088.78,4.44,need the street address and then we need
1091.12,4.59,a postal code or zip code or something
1093.22,4.38,like that so let's just go postal code
1095.71,3.84,now these country this is gonna be a
1097.6,3.9,string almost all of these are gonna be
1099.55,5.13,strings actually this is gonna be a
1101.5,4.83,string this is gonna be a string I think
1104.68,4.07,almost all of these are gonna be strings
1106.33,5.31,and the postal code will be a string as
1108.75,5.05,well so those string and street address
1111.64,3.84,needs to be one word okay so now we have
1113.8,3.18,information relate to an address if we
1115.48,2.7,wanted to add some more information
1116.98,3.09,about address like maybe you wanted to
1118.18,3.9,get really specific and go long gets you
1120.07,4.11,latitude something like that you could
1122.08,4.17,technically add that to this class and
1124.18,3.96,now what we kind of have and let me go
1126.25,4.17,over here and make this a bit bigger is
1128.14,5.13,all of the information that we needed
1130.42,4.23,out of this problem right here I've kind
1133.27,2.91,of taken it out I've read through
1134.65,2.85,everything we needed to and I've said
1136.18,3.69,the information I need to store is the
1137.5,4.56,following I need an address that has all
1139.87,3.99,of this I need a person that has all
1142.06,4.14,that I need a student a professor a
1143.86,5.1,course and in enroll class that stores
1146.2,4.41,the date and the grid awesome now the
1148.96,4.11,next thing to consider is what we call
1150.61,5.31,associations so I've listed all the
1153.07,4.92,attributes specific to these classes but
1155.92,4.29,these classes can associate with each
1157.99,4.68,other in fact you know the address is
1160.21,4.17,going to belong to a person right each
1162.67,3.93,person needs to have an address a
1164.38,4.17,student is going to be enrolled in a
1166.6,3.72,course through this enroll class a
1168.55,4.44,professor is going to be teaching a
1170.32,5.25,course so how do we go about and do that
1172.99,4.86,well this is where we use associations
1175.57,5.91,now associations are different from
1177.85,6.0,attributes they are a way of linking two
1181.48,4.35,objects together and the next part of
1183.85,4.44,what we're gonna do here is pretty much
1185.83,5.04,determine how we want to associate all
1188.29,4.59,of these objects and once we draw that
1190.87,4.02,out and we have the association's don't
1192.88,4.35,be focused on the implementation in code
1194.89,4.35,just be focused on how these objects
1197.23,2.68,interact with each other because if we
1199.24,3.37,can understand
1199.91,4.86,and that we can very easily implement
1202.61,4.2,that into code later on using whatever
1204.77,3.75,programming language we want and that's
1206.81,4.14,why you'll notice you know I'm not using
1208.52,3.87,STR like I've normally would in Python
1210.95,3.54,I'm just writing things that are
1212.39,4.2,descriptive enough that anybody in any
1214.49,4.29,programming language could look at this
1216.59,5.01,and translate this into some kind of
1218.78,5.01,working implementation so let's keep
1221.6,3.69,this on the side of our screen here I'll
1223.79,3.63,make it a little bit smaller and I'm
1225.29,3.63,gonna pop up actually one note and start
1227.42,2.97,doing some drawing so let me grab my
1228.92,3.45,drawing tab and I'll be right back
1230.39,3.15,alright so I've shut off my camera here
1232.37,3.36,just to give us the most amount of
1233.54,3.9,screen real estate as possible and what
1235.73,3.21,I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start I'm
1237.44,2.79,gonna start by apologizing for my
1238.94,4.17,drawing skills because they are very
1240.23,4.8,poor but I'm actually going to draw what
1243.11,3.93,we've just kind of done on the left hand
1245.03,3.87,side of the screen here and put it into
1247.04,3.6,a visual picture so we can actually see
1248.9,4.62,what's going on so I want to draw all of
1250.64,4.38,these classes and I'll tell you what all
1253.52,3.42,of the things that I'm drawing mean and
1255.02,3.87,then what we'll do is actually link them
1256.94,3.6,up just using a lines so essentially I'm
1258.89,3.18,gonna draw all these little boxes that
1260.54,4.26,look like this you know I'm gonna write
1262.07,4.8,here this is a person and then I'll put
1264.8,3.72,in all of the associations for that
1266.87,3.93,person then we'll have another class
1268.52,4.59,over here and what a line like this
1270.8,4.8,means is an association so essentially
1273.11,4.83,this person interacts with this other
1275.6,5.25,class and what we can do is put little
1277.94,5.82,numbers and symbols on this Association
1280.85,5.22,to tell us what this Association is is
1283.76,5.31,this a one-to-one Association which
1286.07,4.77,means one class links to one other class
1289.07,3.57,or does this mean this one class could
1290.84,3.75,look to many other classes is there a
1292.64,4.38,limitation on the amount it can link to
1294.59,4.92,well that's what we're gonna put here
1297.02,4.23,and the idea is that you can write two
1299.51,3.72,numbers so if you write one number what
1301.25,5.01,this states is that is the amount of
1303.23,5.64,associations so when I write one this is
1306.26,4.83,saying that this person class one of it
1308.87,4.29,can link to many which is what the
1311.09,4.74,Asterix stands for of whatever this
1313.16,6.36,class over here might be if I write
1315.83,6.27,something like 1 dot dot - so say let's
1319.52,5.13,replace this with 1 dot dot - what this
1322.1,6.2,means is that we could have one or two
1324.65,6.24,person classes if I write one dot dot
1328.3,5.23,asterisks this says the minimum we can
1330.89,5.13,have is 1 the maximum we can have is
1333.53,4.23,infinite if I write just in asterisks
1336.02,3.93,which is just my crappy star like this
1337.76,4.86,this means we can have as many or as
1339.95,4.95,little of whatever is on this side as we
1342.62,3.66,want so I hope that makes sense it will
1344.9,3.03,make more sense as we go through this
1346.28,4.11,but I just wanted to give you a little
1347.93,5.1,definition for we go too far all right
1350.39,4.53,so let's delete that let's get back into
1353.03,4.02,this so the first class and I'm actually
1354.92,4.68,gonna draw is my person class now
1357.05,4.56,remember my person class is gonna be a
1359.6,3.72,base class so let me just up this pen
1361.61,3.69,size a little bit to make a little bit
1363.32,5.49,easier so let's draw a class like this
1365.3,5.01,I'm gonna try very hard to keep this
1368.81,3.24,neat enough that you can read but it is
1370.31,3.27,hard to do with the drawing tablet so
1372.05,4.02,we're gonna say that's person and what
1373.58,4.23,does a person have on it first name last
1376.07,3.39,name date of birth phone number now just
1377.81,5.13,to keep this video shorter I'm gonna
1379.46,4.86,avoid writing the actual type of what
1382.94,3.06,these are so I'm not gonna write string
1384.32,3.6,and all that I'm just gonna write the
1386.0,5.7,actual name of the attribute so we'll
1387.92,5.52,say here this is first name okay so what
1391.7,3.51,I do a little - like this what I'm
1393.44,4.14,saying is this is an attribute so I'm
1395.21,3.99,essentially saying this is some piece of
1397.58,4.2,information that is contained within
1399.2,6.06,this class so I'm saying first name I'm
1401.78,5.93,gonna say a last name like that what
1405.26,7.26,else do we need date of birth okay
1407.71,8.68,date of birth next we need a phone
1412.52,5.04,number okay so let's go there all right
1416.39,2.79,I don't think that's too bad thank you
1417.56,3.3,guys can kind of read that so there we
1419.18,2.67,go person first name last name date of
1420.86,4.23,birth the phone number
1421.85,5.91,okay now this a member is the base class
1425.09,4.38,for my student and for my professor so
1427.76,2.97,in order to illustrate that what I'm
1429.47,3.18,gonna do is I'm gonna draw two more
1430.73,3.78,classes underneath this and I'm gonna
1432.65,3.78,show you kind of a fancy arrow that we
1434.51,4.14,can use to illustrate that this is a
1436.43,4.53,base class and this is a generalization
1438.65,5.73,so I'm going to draw my two classes here
1440.96,4.8,this is gonna be one for my student so
1444.38,3.39,I'll say actually student will go on the
1445.76,3.9,other side sorry actually maybe not
1447.77,5.1,let's just leave student here student
1449.66,4.89,and this will be professor like that
1452.87,4.02,okay so we have our student and we have
1454.55,4.11,our professor now let's write what we
1456.89,4.41,need inside of here so for our professor
1458.66,5.25,we just had the salary and for our
1461.3,5.88,students we had what is it international
1463.91,5.61,okay so international
1467.18,4.2,and then we had two methods on our
1469.52,3.84,student now usually you do a method
1471.38,3.63,using a plus sign what this says
1473.36,3.42,essentially is this is a public method
1475.01,4.23,everyone else can see this there might
1476.78,4.32,be more methods on the student or on the
1479.24,3.33,professor in the future but if they are
1481.1,3.6,not public we don't write them down
1482.57,3.72,because we're just interested in what
1484.7,2.94,you know all of these classes how
1486.29,3.06,they're gonna interact together and what
1487.64,7.2,they can see on each other so we have
1489.35,8.19,student and we'll say is part time put
1494.84,4.98,some brackets and we'll say on probation
1497.54,3.54,I'm just gonna write probation just to
1499.82,3.06,make it a little bit shorter will write
1501.08,3.45,probation and we'll have two brackets
1502.88,3.09,again if you can't read any of this look
1504.53,4.11,on the side that's why I typed it out
1505.97,4.86,now to illustrate that these are
1508.64,4.53,actually going to be a generalization so
1510.83,4.41,that this is the base class for those
1513.17,4.56,two other classes what you do is you
1515.24,5.12,simply do an arrow like this that is not
1517.73,5.64,filled in and you just do a little line
1520.36,4.63,to these two classes so what this says
1523.37,4.29,essentially is that this student and
1524.99,4.23,this professor are derived from this
1527.66,4.89,person class so they are children class
1529.22,5.28,of this base class person now what this
1532.55,3.33,means is essentially that they have all
1534.5,4.05,of these same attributes and
1535.88,4.5,functionality as this person class so
1538.55,4.38,any associations that are made between
1540.38,5.28,person and some other class will apply
1542.93,4.5,to both of these classes because they
1545.66,3.99,are a generalization of this class
1547.43,4.35,they're just a specific instance of a
1549.65,3.69,person right I hope that makes sense so
1551.78,3.45,let's say we had a teaching assistant
1553.34,4.11,then all we would do is just go like
1555.23,4.2,this and now all we have to add is
1557.45,3.66,anything specific to the teaching
1559.43,4.02,assistant if we want them to be a
1561.11,4.17,derived classroom person so that is as
1563.45,2.91,easy as that is and this is a very
1565.28,3.23,common thing when you're designing
1566.36,3.96,systems to have a base class that
1568.51,3.58,represents kind of the core
1570.32,3.93,functionality and then have specific
1572.09,3.84,instances or specific classes underneath
1574.25,3.39,that that have the additional
1575.93,3.6,functionality you need so we have
1577.64,4.71,persons student professor what do we
1579.53,5.19,need next we need an address now who
1582.35,4.74,hasn't addressed well a student and a
1584.72,4.2,professor both have an address so what
1587.09,5.31,I'm gonna do up here is I'm gonna draw
1588.92,5.6,my address like this and just butcher
1592.4,7.56,all of this once again okay so address
1594.52,6.62,like that and let's go here and let's
1599.96,6.82,write what we need for the address
1601.14,10.14,we have a country okay we have a city we
1606.78,5.94,have a state which I forgot and then I'm
1611.28,2.64,just gonna put dot dot dot you get the
1612.72,2.82,point we have a street address and a
1613.92,2.79,postal code I don't think I need to go
1615.54,2.79,through all of it I think you guys get
1616.71,3.93,the point now what I'm gonna do is
1618.33,4.38,actually draw our first Association so
1620.64,4.53,what I just did down here is called a
1622.71,4.38,generalization now that means that these
1625.17,3.48,things are not associated they are
1627.09,3.72,actually like the same thing right like
1628.65,4.11,a student is a person and a professor is
1630.81,4.32,a person so that is why they are called
1632.76,5.67,a generalization when we do this kind of
1635.13,6.39,arrow like that now what in association
1638.43,6.21,is is a solid line between two classes
1641.52,5.7,that says hey every time I make one of
1644.64,4.83,these classes I can potentially have
1647.22,4.91,this one linked up to it in some way and
1649.47,4.89,now what I do is I define the
1652.13,5.05,multiplicity is what it's called of my
1654.36,4.32,association so essentially how many of
1657.18,4.47,these things can be associated together
1658.68,5.25,well it turns out that one person can
1661.65,4.23,actually have multiple addresses right
1663.93,3.78,that is very possible that they have
1665.88,3.72,multiple addresses so what I'm gonna do
1667.71,4.44,is I'm gonna say one person here because
1669.6,4.89,an address can only belong to one person
1672.15,4.68,will say one address is unique to one
1674.49,3.84,person although in theory that's not
1676.83,2.73,correct you could have brothers or
1678.33,2.64,something that have the same address but
1679.56,3.93,for our system we're going to assume
1680.97,4.38,that this address object maybe there'll
1683.49,3.78,be one that's exactly the same that's
1685.35,3.81,totally fine but they will only belong
1687.27,4.08,to one person they will not be attached
1689.16,4.08,to two different people in other words
1691.35,4.14,we won't have person one here in person
1693.24,4.2,to here pointing to the same address
1695.49,4.17,that won't ever happen they will be two
1697.44,4.35,unique objects so we're gonna say one
1699.66,3.63,and then here I'm actually going to say
1701.79,3.96,asterisks and what I'm gonna do is say
1703.29,5.01,one dot dot which essentially says that
1705.75,4.92,one person must have at least one
1708.3,5.1,address but they can have as many as
1710.67,4.98,they want so the lower bound is one the
1713.4,3.9,upper bound is infinite which means this
1715.65,3.33,person could have infinite amount of
1717.3,3.15,addresses we don't know where they're
1718.98,3.78,gonna live or how many addresses they
1720.45,3.9,have and they have to have at least one
1722.76,3.69,or they have to at least tell us about
1724.35,4.8,one for us to enter them into the system
1726.45,4.68,so when you see something like this this
1729.15,3.63,says that as soon as I make a person I
1731.13,3.75,must create an address that is
1732.78,4.17,associated with that person and
1734.88,4.05,same thing over here on address this
1736.95,3.63,says whenever I make an address I must
1738.93,4.62,have a person that is associated with
1740.58,5.64,that address as easy as it is that is
1743.55,4.26,the first Association we need and in
1746.22,3.27,fact we're actually getting close to
1747.81,3.78,finish this program so we have our
1749.49,4.44,person our student our professor and our
1751.59,4.41,address the next thing we need is a
1753.93,3.54,course now I'm running out of screen
1756.0,3.75,real estate a bit so I'm gonna just do
1757.47,3.72,the course over here which is kind of on
1759.75,3.99,the edge of my drawing tablet so it's
1761.19,4.62,hard to write accurately but will write
1763.74,4.44,course and then what do we have for a
1765.81,4.89,course well we actually had a bunch I'll
1768.18,7.47,just write a few of this straightforward
1770.7,6.99,ones here so we had name we had code we
1775.65,6.09,had min so I'm just gonna short these
1777.69,5.34,min max and then I'll just write we had
1781.74,3.78,a start and end I'll just write the
1783.03,3.66,method is canceled for now but again you
1785.52,2.75,guys get the point that is the
1786.69,5.16,information we would have had so is
1788.27,6.66,cancelled with two brackets okay now
1791.85,5.73,what do we need well guess what we have
1794.93,4.06,professors that are teaching courses so
1797.58,3.72,we need to have an association between
1798.99,4.8,our professor and our course so that we
1801.3,4.2,know that this professor is teaching
1803.79,4.44,this course right so what I'm gonna do
1805.5,5.55,is simply draw a line from professor to
1808.23,5.91,course I'm gonna say course we'll put
1811.05,5.52,one like that and then on professor how
1814.14,4.5,many professors teach a course well it
1816.57,4.38,said at least one professor teaches a
1818.64,5.97,course but sometimes there may be many
1820.95,5.82,so I'm gonna write one dot dot asterisks
1824.61,5.07,like that which essentially says one
1826.77,5.28,course is associated with one or many
1829.68,4.2,professors and every time we make a
1832.05,4.35,professor we must have it associated
1833.88,4.05,with a course wait I don't know if that
1836.4,3.68,sounds correct whenever we have a
1837.93,4.14,professor it must be teaching a course
1840.08,4.0,that's not necessarily true
1842.07,4.38,we could have a professor that doesn't
1844.08,4.2,teach a course that is a possibility of
1846.45,4.68,our system so what I'm gonna do now is
1848.28,5.79,on course go zero dot dot one which
1851.13,5.07,essentially says we can have one
1854.07,5.91,professor teaching this course but we
1856.2,5.52,also might not have any professor sorry
1859.98,3.36,all the way around a professor might
1861.72,3.54,teach a course but they also might not
1863.34,4.26,teach a course and in fact now that I'm
1865.26,2.82,looking at it does only one course make
1867.6,1.29,sense
1868.08,3.15,because what this
1868.89,5.04,then is a professor can only teach at
1871.23,5.58,most one course no that's actually wrong
1873.93,5.82,so what I need to do is change this over
1876.81,4.98,here now to be a star because it could
1879.75,3.78,have a professor could be teaching a
1881.79,3.84,course it could be teaching many courses
1883.53,4.5,it might not be teaching any at all so
1885.63,4.56,let's erase this and let's change this
1888.03,4.62,to a star now I know that just was like
1890.19,3.78,a big you know run around in circles and
1892.65,3.09,me doing everything except the right
1893.97,3.21,answer but the point here is that that's
1895.74,3.63,what you want to think about I'm
1897.18,4.11,bringing you through these scenarios so
1899.37,3.66,that you can understand how you approach
1901.29,3.75,a problem like this and how you think
1903.03,4.41,about those kind of edge cases when you
1905.04,4.02,make your associations on here you want
1907.44,4.05,to be very careful to design for
1909.06,4.53,flexibility if you think the system in
1911.49,4.59,the future might do what you're limiting
1913.59,4.08,it to be able to do maybe don't limit it
1916.08,4.02,to do that it's better to have a system
1917.67,4.5,that is more flexible than to be super
1920.1,3.81,robust and super defined to the
1922.17,3.81,requirements because the requirements do
1923.91,3.75,change and part of designing is
1925.98,3.93,designing for scalability and
1927.66,3.96,flexibility all right so the next class
1929.91,4.23,we have is enroll and this actually
1931.62,3.9,happens to be the last class but this is
1934.14,3.48,actually one of the more complicated
1935.52,3.93,ones and this is what I'm gonna call an
1937.62,4.11,association class so I'm gonna draw it
1939.45,5.66,over here and I'm gonna call this and
1941.73,5.4,roll so let's say enroll like that and
1945.11,4.18,inside of here we're gonna have a date
1947.13,4.59,and what else are we gonna have we're
1949.29,5.64,gonna have the grade the student
1951.72,5.13,received from the course okay so this is
1954.93,4.47,gonna be what we call an association
1956.85,3.69,class now an association class is a
1959.4,4.32,little bit different than a regular
1960.54,6.06,class because what it does is link to
1963.72,6.51,other classes together which means this
1966.6,6.45,never exists on its own it always has an
1970.23,4.59,association between a course and a
1973.05,4.35,student and the whole point of it is to
1974.82,4.08,link a course and a student together so
1977.4,4.29,we draw it a little bit differently than
1978.9,5.67,we draw most regular classes so what I'm
1981.69,5.07,gonna do here is draw an association
1984.57,3.18,between my student and my course it's
1986.76,3.09,getting a little bit messy now I
1987.75,3.84,apologize for that but we do have an
1989.85,3.24,association now between the student and
1991.59,3.36,the course and let's pick the
1993.09,5.34,multiplicity and then I will talk about
1994.95,6.69,how enroll actually operates here so the
1998.43,4.379,multiplicity could be that a student can
2001.64,3.119,be enroll enrolled in
2002.809,4.62,multiple courses and a course can have
2004.759,5.55,multiple students in it so what I'm
2007.429,4.771,gonna say here is first of all on this
2010.309,3.57,side we're gonna put many because a
2012.2,3.479,course can have many students enrolled
2013.879,3.601,in it it might have zero
2015.679,4.32,I might have infinite right it might
2017.48,5.939,have maximum then what we need to have
2019.999,5.491,next is okay well how many courses can a
2023.419,4.26,student be enrolled in well they can be
2025.49,3.779,enrolled in zero so they could
2027.679,2.97,technically be enrolled in zero courses
2029.269,4.471,let me redraw that because I kind of
2030.649,4.47,butchered it and a maximum is six so the
2033.74,3.509,maximum amount of courses that can be
2035.119,3.66,enrolled in is six so essentially what
2037.249,4.321,I've said is that the lower bound is
2038.779,5.1,zero the maximum is six which means that
2041.57,4.229,can be in any range in between that and
2043.879,4.081,based on the amount of courses they're
2045.799,4.08,enrolled in well that is gonna tell us
2047.96,4.02,if they are part-time or if they are
2049.879,4.2,full-time right that is how we're gonna
2051.98,3.75,drive that now this is where the
2054.079,3.721,Association class comes in so what I'm
2055.73,3.81,actually gonna do is draw a dotted line
2057.8,3.74,and I'll redraw that again just to make
2059.54,5.7,it more clear actually over here between
2061.54,6.94,this Association and the in rural class
2065.24,7.889,what this says is this Association is
2068.48,6.119,really enroll hitting course and student
2073.129,3.27,hitting enroll right so this is just
2074.599,3.75,like this enroll class has an
2076.399,4.831,association between course and students
2078.349,5.461,and we use that to be able to determine
2081.23,4.139,what courses a student is enrolled in
2083.81,3.809,that that is the idea behind this
2085.369,4.621,intermediate class it stores an
2087.619,4.26,association with course it stores an
2089.99,3.96,association with student and then it
2091.879,4.921,also stores some attributes on it that
2093.95,4.71,are very useful for example date this
2096.8,3.75,tells us that whenever we create an
2098.66,4.83,association between student and course
2100.55,5.549,we must pick a date that this happened
2103.49,5.099,at so we know when the student enrolled
2106.099,4.351,in this course right that makes a lot of
2108.589,3.601,sense and you can now determine say if a
2110.45,3.54,student was late to enroll in the course
2112.19,3.78,because on course if you look over here
2113.99,3.81,we have the start and the end date
2115.97,3.69,left-hand side of my screen and we can
2117.8,4.5,compare the date that they enrolled in
2119.66,5.37,to the start and the end then we have
2122.3,5.1,great well that tells us what grade they
2125.03,3.99,got in this enrolled course and since
2127.4,4.439,there's an association between course
2129.02,4.62,and enroll and student and enroll what
2131.839,4.801,we can actually have is we can have the
2133.64,4.59,professor update the grade of a student
2136.64,2.76,so think about how this works right if I
2138.23,3.809,need to update the grade of a student
2139.4,5.189,well the professor has an association to
2142.039,4.83,course the course has an association to
2144.589,5.01,enroll and enroll has an association to
2146.869,4.44,all of the students right so in this way
2149.599,3.841,what I can do is I can have the
2151.309,3.931,professor look at the course look at all
2153.44,3.839,of the students enrolled and then go
2155.24,4.589,into this enroll class and modify the
2157.279,4.231,grade this way the professor does not
2159.829,3.601,actually get to look at any of the
2161.51,4.74,personal information of the student to
2163.43,5.07,upgrade it it's great all it has to do
2166.25,4.319,is look at this enroll Association class
2168.5,3.99,and say hey all I need to do here is
2170.569,4.02,change the grade and then that will
2172.49,3.839,automatically update for the course and
2174.589,3.871,for the student and what's great about
2176.329,3.99,this is well since every single student
2178.46,3.69,is associated to the course with an
2180.319,3.78,enroll class if I want it to do
2182.15,4.949,something like get the average grade of
2184.099,5.19,the course all I would do is look at all
2187.099,4.47,the associations between student and one
2189.289,4.5,specific course look at that enroll
2191.569,4.381,class and then grab all of those grades
2193.789,3.99,so this is the kind of system that I
2195.95,4.02,designed and that we were trying to
2197.779,4.471,design from the beginning something that
2199.97,3.72,is flexible and that can do a bunch of
2202.25,3.869,operations that may not have been
2203.69,5.429,defined yet but that we probably want to
2206.119,6.42,do in the future so that is pretty much
2209.119,5.371,it for this design I need to erase this
2212.539,4.08,one line here I don't think that was
2214.49,4.17,supposed to be there but this is our
2216.619,4.23,finalized design and I apologize that is
2218.66,4.02,super messy but the point of this video
2220.849,3.781,is not to be like you know the most
2222.68,4.71,perfect the most robust it's to teach
2224.63,4.83,you the process of looking at a software
2227.39,5.25,system and designing it from the ground
2229.46,5.73,up starting from scratch extracting the
2232.64,4.949,necessary information translating that
2235.19,5.669,information and then drawing a somewhat
2237.589,4.621,you know kind of plan drawing a design
2240.859,3.331,that we can actually go ahead now and
2242.21,4.349,implement because if you think about it
2244.19,5.01,now all you have to do if you want to
2246.559,4.591,make this system is look at this and
2249.2,3.72,start implementing what I've defined and
2251.15,3.689,if you actually look at this as not very
2252.92,4.32,complicated right we've broken
2254.839,3.811,everything down into classes which you
2257.24,3.029,can write we've broken it down into
2258.65,3.6,methods and we've broken it down into
2260.269,3.6,attributes so you don't even really have
2262.25,3.539,to think now when you go about
2263.869,4.021,programming this you just have to look
2265.789,2.97,at this design and follow it and if
2267.89,1.79,there's something that needs to be
2268.759,3.081,changed
2269.68,3.9,make that change accordingly right if we
2271.84,3.15,want to implement person all I do is
2273.58,2.94,make a class called person add a
2274.99,4.02,constructor that has these four
2276.52,3.09,arguments and there we go I've made
2279.01,2.07,person
2279.61,3.51,all right I want student and professor
2281.08,4.2,let's have them extend the person class
2283.12,4.59,let's go okay add an international
2285.28,5.22,attribute add these two methods is
2287.71,5.21,part-time is on probation professor
2290.5,4.62,let's add a salary there we go Oh
2292.92,4.06,associations okay great let's handle
2295.12,4.32,these associations let's make a private
2296.98,5.04,field in each of these that stores the
2299.44,4.98,association between address or something
2302.02,4.71,like that right and that is as easy as
2304.42,4.02,it is to do now the last thing I will
2306.73,3.36,say here just because some people might
2308.44,3.72,be confused on how these associations
2310.09,4.41,are implemented when you have a
2312.16,4.29,one-to-one Association you can think of
2314.5,3.93,that just like another attribute so let
2316.45,4.17,me actually I don't want to erase all of
2318.43,5.67,this but let me just do something like
2320.62,6.0,up here in this little area essentially
2324.1,4.74,let's say person has a one-to-one
2326.62,4.68,association with address so imagine that
2328.84,5.91,this is actually one what that means is
2331.3,5.25,on the person class we have another
2334.75,3.57,attribute called address I don't need to
2336.55,3.96,write it because the association's infer
2338.32,4.05,that and what this is really equal to is
2340.51,4.77,an address object right it's equal to
2342.37,4.41,some instance of address and then that
2345.28,3.45,way if we want to access the address of
2346.78,4.11,a person I just call person dot address
2348.73,5.01,now this is the exact same thing on
2350.89,5.91,address so let me erase this if this is
2353.74,7.17,one-to-one then on side of address right
2356.8,6.75,this has an attribute that says person
2360.91,5.67,so this just says person right and then
2363.55,5.28,it points to a person object and there
2366.58,4.02,you go that way the address if it wanted
2368.83,3.63,to see the person it could the person
2370.6,3.87,wants to see the address they can write
2372.46,4.11,that is how a one-to-one Association
2374.47,3.78,happens now sometimes you might not
2376.57,3.69,store it on the address side it really
2378.25,4.2,depends but now let's say we have this
2380.26,3.96,one-to-many right then what we would do
2382.45,4.29,is on here we'd have another attribute
2384.22,4.23,it would be called addresses like that
2386.74,3.99,and it would just be equal to a list
2388.45,5.22,that stored all of the addresses inside
2390.73,4.2,of it that's as easy as it is and that
2393.67,3.09,is what I'm talking about when I say
2394.93,3.81,Association it's just a link between
2396.76,4.38,these two objects you implement that
2398.74,3.849,link however you want but usually it's
2401.14,3.31,done just with another attribute
2402.589,4.23,or with something in the actual class
2404.45,4.919,itself and that is how you can link
2406.819,5.341,these different things together so with
2409.369,5.311,that being said that has been this video
2412.16,4.109,I know this is not you know the most I
2414.68,3.539,don't want to say educational but this
2416.269,3.54,is really just the way of teaching you
2418.219,3.63,about how to think about this it's just
2419.809,4.381,the way of training your brain to look
2421.849,3.93,at information break it down and throw
2424.19,3.359,it into some kind of design that you can
2425.779,3.21,then go ahead and implement so like I
2427.549,3.091,said at the beginning if you want to see
2428.989,4.35,the code for this leave a like subscribe
2430.64,4.439,to the channel comment spam me let me
2433.339,3.69,know and I will try my best to make a
2435.079,3.42,video where we implement this exact
2437.029,2.611,design so that being said I hope you
2438.499,2.881,enjoyed if you did leave it like
2439.64,4.609,subscribe and I will see you in the next
2441.38,2.869,YouTube video
