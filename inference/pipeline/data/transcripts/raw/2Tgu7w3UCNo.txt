12.639,4.961,minute or two if you're wondering why
13.92,5.119,the olympics music is playing um
17.6,3.12,it was because
19.039,3.361,we thought it'd be funny to have some
20.72,3.44,background music so i'm going to leave
22.4,6.119,that playing for another minute or so
24.16,4.359,just wait for stragglers to join us
32.399,3.0,my
48.96,3.339,[Music]
65.18,20.659,[Music]
88.72,4.719,all right
90.88,3.44,welcome to uh folks that are joining us
93.439,3.441,today
94.32,4.24,uh thank you so much for uh meeting us
96.88,5.279,in this session this is a session that
98.56,5.28,is going to run for an hour uh it's
102.159,3.521,called human computer interaction and
103.84,4.8,user interface design
105.68,4.56,it's hosted by me my name is tony tang
108.64,4.24,i'm an associate professor at the
110.24,4.48,university of toronto and
112.88,3.279,my colleague uh if you want to introduce
114.72,4.16,yourself
116.159,4.64,hi everyone i'm anastasia kuzminik i'm
118.88,4.0,also professor at the university of
120.799,4.481,toronto uh doing research in human
122.88,4.559,computer interaction
125.28,5.92,great and this is so this is the second
127.439,6.321,session today for uh infocon 2021 so uh
131.2,4.08,hopefully you uh have been we're
133.76,3.76,involved yesterday and saw a couple of
135.28,4.0,sessions there and uh of course just as
137.52,4.48,a reminder to you uh the sessions
139.28,4.8,continue on uh through the day today and
142.0,4.0,into tomorrow as well basically for the
144.08,3.92,whole day so like if you aren't getting
146.0,3.68,enough of school right now you can uh
148.0,4.64,you can continue to sign in from eight
149.68,4.8,to five o'clock uh pacific time uh for
152.64,3.679,another eight hours of great content
154.48,3.6,from different professors and faculty
156.319,4.0,members uh uh
158.08,4.08,in i schools across
160.319,3.041,uh certainly across
162.16,3.04,the
163.36,4.0,north america no it also looks across
165.2,4.16,the world so that's really really cool
167.36,3.84,if you join the session just before this
169.36,4.72,one that is called that was called ux
171.2,5.28,and ui design careers uh uh hosted by a
174.08,4.079,colleague of ours uh mark twydale um
176.48,2.64,unfortunately at least i didn't attend
178.159,2.641,the previous one because i didn't
179.12,4.24,register in time so i don't i'm not sure
180.8,4.079,if anastasia did i have no idea how much
183.36,2.959,of the content is going to overlap
184.879,3.28,however i'm going to throw myself out
186.319,3.92,there and just say that i think none of
188.159,4.16,the content is going to go overlap uh at
190.239,4.801,least not really because ours is going
192.319,4.64,to be way way better all right so um
195.04,4.4,what's going to happen today is i'm
196.959,4.721,going to give just a kind of a 20 minute
199.44,4.079,kind of primer if you will on
201.68,3.6,what we think about is user experience
203.519,3.921,design and
205.28,4.08,not really talk about our program per se
207.44,3.84,but just kind of give you a hint about
209.36,3.92,some of the things that you would be uh
211.28,5.519,learning about and thinking about if you
213.28,5.519,were part of a high school that had a
216.799,4.16,user experience design program
218.799,3.121,following that anastasia is going to do
220.959,3.2,uh
221.92,5.2,can remember if you wrote 27
224.159,5.36,27 minute talk ish minute seattle talk
227.12,5.119,and i'm gonna show you how um academic
229.519,5.121,research informs design and show you how
232.239,3.92,our studies might look like um
234.64,2.319,and things like that
236.159,4.561,great
236.959,5.92,so i think we are i i i think we're open
240.72,4.64,to questions through so if you've got a
242.879,4.0,burning question uh even if it's not
245.36,4.959,burning but just kind of like a minor
246.879,5.601,twitch uh please uh please please oh pop
250.319,4.241,up your hand or type something into chat
252.48,5.279,uh i can tell you as an instructor
254.56,5.76,during these coveted times it is uh
257.759,4.72,excruciating uh talking to my computer
260.32,3.76,screen and a bunch of icons so if
262.479,4.0,there's something i can talk
264.08,4.48,at or respond to that feels a lot lot
266.479,3.681,better so please feel free to ask
268.56,3.6,questions at any time
270.16,3.52,we're more than happy to respond and
272.16,4.0,don't worry we'll figure out how to make
273.68,4.88,up that time a little bit later okay so
276.16,4.479,uh if if there's nothing else i think
278.56,4.48,that's basically housekeeping i'm just
280.639,5.28,going to get going here and do the thing
283.04,4.8,where i say okay let me share my screen
285.919,4.081,and fuss around with this until i figure
287.84,3.6,it out here so
290.0,3.68,um
291.44,6.479,screen is sharing we all see that it's
293.68,5.76,okay anastasia great okay so
297.919,3.12,this is the first thing that i like to
299.44,4.16,share at the beginning of many of my
301.039,3.681,classes i think this is a hilarious
303.6,4.159,example
304.72,4.56,so uh this is a story uh actually now
307.759,3.201,each year gets older and older but this
309.28,2.88,is a story from about six years ago now
310.96,3.92,i suppose
312.16,4.4,and the headline is ford recalls suvs
314.88,3.12,because drivers are accidentally turning
316.56,4.0,them off
318.0,4.8,and this is the console i'd like you to
320.56,4.0,take a look at this and to try and think
322.8,4.08,about what's going on here what's going
324.56,4.0,on that makes drivers actually
326.88,5.92,accidentally turn
328.56,6.079,this uh suv off and i will give i don't
332.8,3.679,know a virtual high five to the first
334.639,3.441,person that can figure this out really
336.479,2.56,really quickly so i'm going to give you
338.08,3.2,i don't know
339.039,3.521,10 seconds of awkward silence if you
341.28,3.359,think you've got it feel free to
342.56,3.6,populate that in the chat
344.639,4.521,in the meantime i'll stare at you
346.16,3.0,quietly
362.88,4.319,okay that is far more awkward in real
364.639,5.12,life than it is uh quietly in my office
367.199,4.401,so um i'm gonna assume that you may have
369.759,3.121,figured this out or you may not have but
371.6,3.12,i'm gonna kind of walk you through
372.88,3.68,what's going on here so this is the
374.72,3.28,console dash right so this is where you
376.56,4.079,would play with your radio and stuff
378.0,4.479,like that for a car and one of the
380.639,3.361,things that they did in this suv was
382.479,3.761,they were being very innovative and
384.0,4.88,decided instead of having any sort of
386.24,5.44,stick shift control to to go from
388.88,4.48,parking to reverse to neutral and so on
391.68,3.92,they decided to make them into buttons
393.36,4.8,along here so you can see parking uh
395.6,4.08,reverse neutral drive and this is the
398.16,3.12,sport
399.68,3.04,setting not quite sure what the sport
401.28,3.44,setting does but that's the sport
402.72,4.16,setting right there and underneath
404.72,5.199,you'll notice right here this is the
406.88,5.52,engine start stop button and so what was
409.919,4.0,happening with this vehicle is that the
412.4,2.96,start stop button was right there and
413.919,3.201,people were essentially when they were
415.36,3.36,kind of reaching over they were driving
417.12,4.16,they're like oh i need some sport mode
418.72,4.4,here they'd reach over hit the button to
421.28,2.96,to try to start sport mode but they
423.12,2.88,weren't looking because they'd be
424.24,3.04,looking up there and or their finger
426.0,4.24,would slip and then it would actually
427.28,4.88,turn their car off while people were out
430.24,3.84,driving the vehicle which is uh if you
432.16,3.36,can think about situations where you
434.08,4.0,might be wanting to switch into sport
435.52,3.44,mode kind of dangerous right
438.08,3.679,uh
438.96,4.48,and so you know for me as somebody who
441.759,3.121,thinks about user experience design who
443.44,3.44,thinks about these experiences that
444.88,4.719,we're designing for people i actually
446.88,5.28,think that for me i'm actually you know
449.599,5.04,i'm i'm a little offended by the the the
452.16,5.28,title here because i think this um this
454.639,5.441,title of this article uh as perhaps
457.44,5.199,descriptive as it may be actually um
460.08,4.799,ascribes the blame to people who are
462.639,4.4,driving the car right it describes blame
464.879,4.481,to drivers but to me this is actually a
467.039,5.361,design problem so if i were redesigning
469.36,5.2,this uh this title what i would say is
472.4,3.68,ford recalls suvs because poor user
474.56,4.479,experience is creating dangerous
476.08,5.119,situations because to me the fault
479.039,4.321,should uh lie in the people that
481.199,5.201,designed this thing not so much uh the
483.36,5.92,people that are driving the cars
486.4,5.68,uh so the title of this talk is called
489.28,4.4,the primer on user experience design and
492.08,3.519,human computer interaction what i'm
493.68,3.359,going to do today is spend a lot of time
495.599,3.681,talking about these little examples
497.039,4.321,these toy examples that i've seen in
499.28,4.319,everyday life and talk about how i think
501.36,4.16,they kind of help us to understand why
503.599,3.6,certain experiences are designed poorly
505.52,3.519,and what they say about how we should
507.199,5.041,design things
509.039,6.24,objects tools or things that people use
512.24,5.84,in in better ways
515.279,3.841,so to me bad design is absolutely
518.08,3.36,everywhere
519.12,3.2,and in fact one of the bad things about
521.44,2.399,kind of
522.32,3.36,doing a program in user experience
523.839,4.0,design is that you learn about what good
525.68,4.0,design ought to be and so all you see in
527.839,4.881,everyday life is how everything is
529.68,5.52,terrible um on the left there uh if you
532.72,4.559,are a guy that uses uh public uh
535.2,4.079,washrooms you'll understand why this is
537.279,5.441,a challenge if you are not then i will
539.279,5.521,describe the situation essentially this
542.72,5.679,would be a very uncomfortable uh urinal
544.8,5.36,situation to use uh to pee in um
548.399,3.921,particularly if there was somebody else
550.16,4.16,who was thinking about peeing next to
552.32,4.16,you really needed to go it's just
554.32,5.199,ultimately not a lot of space the
556.48,4.64,example on the right is also a bathroom
559.519,3.76,bathroom example
561.12,5.12,this is essentially an automatic faucet
563.279,5.041,and essentially it it is it this is a
566.24,4.159,situation where they decided to put up a
568.32,3.68,sign because it wasn't clear how to use
570.399,4.321,this thing right so it tells you that
572.0,4.88,it's an automatic faucet it explains you
574.72,4.08,that to turn it on you need to walk up
576.88,3.92,to the sink um
578.8,3.76,uh and to turn it off you walk away from
580.8,3.76,the sink so don't worry this thing is
582.56,4.0,going to turn itself off i think the
584.56,3.92,other thing so you know here's a sign
586.56,4.48,that tries to explain how to use the
588.48,4.56,thing right um i think the other thing
591.04,4.96,that's really interesting about this
593.04,6.72,example is that it says black clothing
596.0,5.6,does not operate faucets like and
599.76,4.319,as a former engineer in a previous
601.6,4.64,version of my life i can understand why
604.079,4.081,that would be the case but this is just
606.24,3.839,horrible right so if i'm wearing black
608.16,3.52,clothes like it doesn't work but
610.079,2.88,actually if you kind of tease apart the
611.68,3.2,language there it doesn't make a lot of
612.959,4.161,sense either because to turn on and off
614.88,4.48,you walk up and back but the clothes
617.12,5.279,don't do that so anyway i think these
619.36,5.039,are uh these are examples of of poor uh
622.399,4.081,user experience designs
624.399,4.56,i'm gonna show you this video that i uh
626.48,6.56,that i watch this is munchies this is a
628.959,5.681,a food uh a food uh food youtube channel
633.04,2.96,that i like to watch anyway i just saw
634.64,3.36,this clip the other day i thought it was
636.0,4.079,really funny and kind of on point you
638.0,3.92,will not be able to hear the audio um
640.079,3.921,but what i'd like you to do is focus on
641.92,4.4,this person right here and to think
644.0,4.24,about what's gonna happen as she tries
646.32,5.48,to go through that
648.24,3.56,that door there
664.72,4.32,okay
666.64,4.08,so if you are like me if you are like
669.04,4.08,her you have been in these kinds of
670.72,4.08,situations before where you're trying to
673.12,3.52,go through a door and for some reason it
674.8,3.68,doesn't work quite the way you expect
676.64,4.08,these are tiny little moments in your
678.48,4.799,life but if you accumulate all those
680.72,4.72,tiny moments across your life and across
683.279,4.161,all the people's lives that will go
685.44,5.2,through that door you can kind of start
687.44,5.68,to tally up how many instances of
690.64,5.04,displeasure this causes and potentially
693.12,4.719,how much time this wastes um and
695.68,3.92,potentially you know maybe how much food
697.839,4.081,is wasted as they kind of exit this
699.6,4.08,place so what's happening of course here
701.92,3.28,is that as she's trying to leave she
703.68,4.48,tries to push the door and it doesn't
705.2,4.48,work and uh and and everybody's laughing
708.16,4.08,at her and it's really funny but if you
709.68,4.959,think about what she's doing what she's
712.24,5.76,doing actually makes perfect sense this
714.639,5.44,type of handle is the push handle she is
718.0,5.279,doing the right thing or at least the
720.079,4.721,way that the the the um the object is
723.279,3.521,telling her to do it she is doing the
724.8,3.599,right thing and so when it doesn't work
726.8,3.12,it's kind of weird
728.399,2.88,you'll notice on the other side of the
729.92,3.84,door that's the side of the door that
731.279,4.8,we're sitting on um we actually see this
733.76,4.0,handle right here which is a pull handle
736.079,4.161,there's no question about it this is the
737.76,3.84,pull handle and of course here again is
740.24,3.36,a sign
741.6,4.799,that is written there that says oh from
743.6,5.76,here you need to push and so a couple of
746.399,5.12,insights here um one is that often when
749.36,4.24,you see a sign it's because the tool
751.519,4.241,itself or the object itself is not doing
753.6,4.32,a good enough job of explaining exactly
755.76,3.759,how the thing ought to be used and so uh
757.92,3.44,people that use the environment are like
759.519,3.281,oh i guess we gotta explain kind of how
761.36,2.8,it's working here or how it's supposed
762.8,3.36,to work right
764.16,3.6,okay so i feel like i'm definitely doing
766.16,3.679,the prof thing of just belaboring these
767.76,4.079,kind of ridiculous little examples and
769.839,3.281,so if you don't enjoy that then now's
771.839,2.8,the time to sign up otherwise i'm gonna
773.12,3.12,keep going on these kind of ridiculous
774.639,4.801,little symbols uh these little
776.24,5.92,ridiculous little examples um this is uh
779.44,5.76,in in the in the uh in the sort of
782.16,5.679,academic uh uh context this is what we
785.2,4.72,call a signifier so the way in which the
787.839,3.921,door handle is shaped is a signifier and
789.92,3.84,it signifies a particular way of
791.76,3.6,interacting with the thing and what we
793.76,3.759,would say here is that the design
795.36,3.68,problem is that the signifier is
797.519,3.841,actually misleading it doesn't actually
799.04,3.039,inform the person how to use it properly
801.36,2.32,and
802.079,3.041,you'll know as a person that goes
803.68,2.719,through doors you're not actively
805.12,2.719,thinking about this it's almost
806.399,2.961,unconscious you're just like oh that
807.839,3.841,handle okay this is the kind of thing i
809.36,4.24,do um but that's exactly the moment
811.68,3.44,where the signifiers matter right so
813.6,3.12,choosing the right signifiers in the
815.12,3.68,right moment for the right place is a
816.72,3.6,really really important problem
818.8,4.0,i was going through some old slide decks
820.32,4.56,the other day and i realized that uh
822.8,3.039,this uh this example which i'd like to
824.88,2.24,show
825.839,3.201,is now
827.12,5.839,truly a classic example from my
829.04,5.68,childhood and uh i i i'm curious
832.959,3.761,how many people have any idea what this
834.72,4.08,is and if you don't it's not a big deal
836.72,3.6,i'll walk you through this uh if you do
838.8,4.64,then you know exactly what i'm talking
840.32,5.68,about okay so this is this used to be
843.44,5.12,the back of uh most computers okay and
846.0,4.72,this is kind of a little bit hard to uh
848.56,4.079,explain without having like a computer
850.72,4.0,in front of me but essentially the top
852.639,4.081,part of the image that the part that has
854.72,4.0,these two little black plugs is kind of
856.72,3.44,like upright and then the bottom part of
858.72,4.72,the image where there's a green and an
860.16,4.96,orange uh icon it's sideways like this
863.44,3.519,so you can imagine that the two black
865.12,3.2,things are kind of up here and down here
866.959,3.921,i'm trying to show this in my little
868.32,4.72,video here but my my book is all blurred
870.88,3.759,out but anyway black black and then
873.04,5.2,green and red
874.639,5.521,so these two plugs are called uh ps2 uh
878.24,3.52,plugs uh not playstation 2 i can't
880.16,3.359,remember what ps2 actually stands for
881.76,3.199,but anyway they were for your keyboard
883.519,3.12,and for your mouse
884.959,4.0,and uh
886.639,4.161,they are the exact same plug right so
888.959,3.921,our mouse yeah this is back in the data
890.8,4.719,wired like wired peripherals and we
892.88,3.759,didn't have usb yet right um and so we
895.519,2.88,plugged these two things into our
896.639,3.281,computer uh part of the problem is that
898.399,2.721,usually it's behind the computer so you
899.92,2.719,can see the back of the computer but
901.12,3.68,anyway even if you could see the uh
902.639,3.521,computer um the back of the computer one
904.8,3.52,of the problems is you weren't sure
906.16,4.239,which one to plug it into right you can
908.32,4.0,see one of them is meant for uh the
910.399,4.641,mouse one of them is meant for the
912.32,4.4,keyboard and what i can tell you is the
915.04,4.159,problem with this interface is that it's
916.72,4.72,not clear uh whether the green thing
919.199,4.481,matches up with this this green thing
921.44,4.079,matches up with the top green thing or
923.68,3.92,whether it matches up with this green
925.519,3.521,thing because you can kind of easily
927.6,2.799,imagine that
929.04,3.359,two different kind of ways to think
930.399,3.921,about this maybe these two icons go like
932.399,4.321,that and so they just kind of you know
934.32,4.24,flip up like that or it's kind of this
936.72,3.84,mirror situation because you've also
938.56,3.839,seen that too where this thing matches
940.56,4.079,up kind of like that sort of like it's a
942.399,4.24,mirror type of a situation
944.639,3.2,so these are the kinds of very simple
946.639,3.041,versions of the problems that we deal
947.839,4.081,with in user experience design and i
949.68,3.519,would argue that these two design these
951.92,3.52,two solutions that you can see on the
953.199,4.481,right addresses this problem this is
955.44,4.959,what we call a mapping problem so how do
957.68,4.32,how do people map you know one uh
960.399,4.0,particular series of things to another
962.0,5.759,series of inputs so here's one solution
964.399,4.961,if you simply put the icons next to
967.759,3.921,the thing that we were supposed to plug
969.36,4.96,into that would be very clear what to do
971.68,4.8,similarly if you simply kind of use some
974.32,4.959,color coding to support that mapping
976.48,4.719,that would also help a lot and so these
979.279,4.161,are kind of simple concepts that we kind
981.199,3.921,of visit and revisit again when we're
983.44,2.72,kind of doing user experience design and
985.12,4.079,when we're doing human computer
986.16,3.919,interaction uh research in the lab
989.199,4.56,so
990.079,6.801,um i want to invite a response or two on
993.759,5.041,what you think this is i can tell you
996.88,4.319,that uh this is something i took a
998.8,5.52,picture of when i was on a trip so i'm
1001.199,5.76,interested to hear what people might
1004.32,7.519,imagine this uh would have been an image
1006.959,4.88,of i was on a i was on vacation i think
1012.32,4.48,so anything goes
1014.56,5.12,jill excellent elevator buttons gold
1016.8,4.8,star for you and i see moisies uh moises
1019.68,3.92,uh responded a little earlier
1021.6,5.12,jill and nicole gold stars for both of
1023.6,5.52,you these are elevator buttons what is
1026.72,3.359,okay fine jen you also get a gold star
1029.12,2.4,um
1030.079,3.921,let's give it a silver star with that
1031.52,4.48,olympic theme olympic medal uh our
1034.0,4.72,silver medal olympic theme okay anyway
1036.0,4.48,so these are indeed elevator buttons
1038.72,2.959,what i want to ask you now is to think
1040.48,3.76,about why
1041.679,5.041,like what makes this set of elevator
1044.24,5.12,buttons maybe so special what's so cool
1046.72,4.16,about what's going on here
1049.36,4.16,ah yes
1050.88,5.039,uh okay uh
1053.52,3.519,i see a response here i'm sorry i'm not
1055.919,3.281,quite sure how to pronounce that name
1057.039,5.601,but yes there's braille on here so
1059.2,5.44,braille is a way of allowing uh helping
1062.64,4.24,people that can't see that well um to
1064.64,4.56,read things right and so you can see
1066.88,3.2,here that there is braille on each of
1069.2,3.12,these
1070.08,4.719,on each of these elevator buttons what's
1072.32,4.64,really neat about it is uh braille is
1074.799,3.601,basically these uh like little raised
1076.96,3.04,bumps that you can rate you know run
1078.4,3.36,your finger over and that allows you to
1080.0,4.24,kind of like read text that allows you
1081.76,4.56,to render uh characters and letters and
1084.24,3.6,stuff like this
1086.32,3.84,so the reason i took a picture of this
1087.84,4.0,was it looks kind of cool so this is
1090.16,3.68,some like hyper
1091.84,3.839,doodad elevator where when you walk in
1093.84,4.16,you don't see anything but as the
1095.679,4.401,elevator door closes this cool like
1098.0,4.799,projection thing happens on the wall and
1100.08,4.959,so these like elevator numbers actually
1102.799,3.841,start to get projected so kind of
1105.039,4.321,and then you can kind of see
1106.64,5.44,this is a touch sensitive elevator so
1109.36,5.12,when you touch things uh it activates
1112.08,4.479,things so this is okay again maybe about
1114.48,3.52,five ten years ago so it's really really
1116.559,4.24,cool
1118.0,4.72,and so you could in fact like and so
1120.799,3.201,this whole wall is basically a touch
1122.72,4.64,sensitive wall
1124.0,4.96,what is ridiculous about this so uh so
1127.36,3.52,hopefully at this point you might be
1128.96,4.079,able to see what the problem here is
1130.88,4.4,right so it's a touch sensitive wall
1133.039,4.64,which is super cool on the other hand
1135.28,4.0,and it's also super cool that they're
1137.679,3.041,embedding some braille into the
1139.28,4.24,environment so that people that can't
1140.72,5.28,see that well right people who have uh
1143.52,4.24,vision deficit challenges they can also
1146.0,2.72,use the elevator as well by using
1147.76,3.279,braille
1148.72,4.24,but therein lies the challenge of course
1151.039,4.321,if i am a person that needs to use
1152.96,4.719,braille to read the elevator to read
1155.36,4.64,which buttons i'm supposed to press um
1157.679,4.961,i'm probably activating every single
1160.0,5.28,button by running my finger over each of
1162.64,4.96,these over each of these braille buttons
1165.28,4.16,so this is an instance where i would say
1167.6,4.56,the heart is in the right place but the
1169.44,5.68,execution is a little bit lacking to me
1172.16,5.28,this is uh what i would call sort of an
1175.12,4.32,obvious problem in hindsight but the
1177.44,3.76,real problem is that often the designers
1179.44,3.119,that are actually making the systems
1181.2,3.12,they often aren't the ones that are
1182.559,3.12,using them and so often they make
1184.32,3.28,assumptions about how the systems are
1185.679,3.521,going to be used and so one of the
1187.6,3.199,things that we do in user experience
1189.2,3.76,design research and user experience
1190.799,4.401,design is we build empathy tools to try
1192.96,3.68,to understand who our users are and so
1195.2,2.719,in this case one of the things that you
1196.64,3.2,would say is like okay well if you were
1197.919,4.081,to do this a little bit better what you
1199.84,4.24,would do is you'd you know put on
1202.0,3.919,goggles that make your vision kind of
1204.08,3.76,foggy and to try to learn how to read
1205.919,3.281,braille and to try to experience what
1207.84,3.68,that elevator would feel like that's
1209.2,4.16,something we call an empathy tool
1211.52,3.76,the other technique of course is that we
1213.36,3.679,use prototyping so we build things we
1215.28,4.24,mock things up and then we test the
1217.039,4.0,designs to see if we can uncover new
1219.52,3.44,problems that we hadn't anticipated
1221.039,3.201,before so we actually would give it to a
1222.96,4.32,set of
1224.24,4.88,uh people to test out uh as a pretend
1227.28,3.84,elevator we would try to find people
1229.12,3.84,that we're trying to tackle with this uh
1231.12,3.36,system so if we were doing it for an
1232.96,3.28,office space fine find some office
1234.48,3.439,workers if we were trying to support
1236.24,3.28,blind users or people that have low
1237.919,2.961,vision then we would find some of those
1239.52,3.279,people and have them test out this
1240.88,4.159,elevator interface and just to see kind
1242.799,5.961,of how they experience this
1245.039,3.721,experience this interface
1249.679,2.721,oops
1250.559,4.881,so let's move on here
1252.4,5.04,i think this is a really important idea
1255.44,4.56,this notion that often designers aren't
1257.44,4.8,the ones that are using the systems um
1260.0,4.08,here's an example i think i took this
1262.24,4.08,screenshot maybe about five years ago or
1264.08,4.64,something like that uh from my windows
1266.32,4.4,pc i turned it on one day and then like
1268.72,3.92,both of these things popped up i'm a
1270.72,3.6,computer scientist by training so i have
1272.64,4.08,some sense of what some of this language
1274.32,4.239,means but i can tell you that even in
1276.72,3.04,this moment uh so i was like i'll do the
1278.559,3.12,right thing i'll hit this update now
1279.76,4.08,button right so like you know as opposed
1281.679,3.521,to the notify me later except for never
1283.84,3.04,notify me because i never want to be
1285.2,2.88,bothered about it i'm so i was doing
1286.88,3.44,what i thought was the right thing and
1288.08,4.0,then this thing popped up and it was a
1290.32,3.76,really interesting moment where i was
1292.08,3.92,like actually right now i'm not sure
1294.08,3.92,what i'm supposed to do because what i
1296.0,4.88,did was i told the system like hey get
1298.0,4.48,the new drivers and sure fine scan my
1300.88,3.36,hardware do whatever you're supposed to
1302.48,4.48,do this is like maintenance stuff right
1304.24,4.319,and then down here it says okay update
1306.96,4.16,the system bios
1308.559,4.161,and my system is going to restart and i
1311.12,3.679,should close all the open documents and
1312.72,4.079,exit all the running applications don't
1314.799,3.841,interrupt the procedure once it begins
1316.799,3.76,don't just like this sounds really
1318.64,3.76,really serious and i can tell you as
1320.559,3.36,somebody who kind of like grew up around
1322.4,3.6,computers like i said computer
1323.919,4.321,scientists by training like even this
1326.0,4.24,gave me a moment even for me this gave
1328.24,3.52,me a moment to pause so i was like wait
1330.24,4.24,which of these things should i be doing
1331.76,4.88,here i'm actually not really really sure
1334.48,2.96,and then i and then if you think about
1336.64,1.84,this
1337.44,2.8,uh
1338.48,2.8,what would that experience be like for
1340.24,3.28,somebody who
1341.28,3.84,isn't a computer scientist who doesn't
1343.52,3.92,know what all of these words mean like
1345.12,5.2,what the heck does bios mean or is it
1347.44,5.359,even pronounced bios name is france bios
1350.32,4.08,right do not interrupt do not disconnect
1352.799,3.76,these are really really sounds like
1354.4,3.68,really serious things and they're scary
1356.559,3.201,sounding and i think one of the things
1358.08,3.68,that we want to try to do when we build
1359.76,3.84,systems for people to use build tools
1361.76,3.68,for people to use build experiences for
1363.6,3.28,people to use because we want to make it
1365.44,3.76,so that it is
1366.88,4.08,a friction free experience as best we
1369.2,3.359,can we want to make it so that it is
1370.96,2.88,smooth we want to make it so that
1372.559,3.441,they're not scared about the
1373.84,3.12,consequences of taking one action or
1376.0,3.039,another
1376.96,3.76,and so if you
1379.039,3.12,uh maybe you don't have to imagine maybe
1380.72,3.439,you've lived this experience if you
1382.159,3.76,imagine yourself seeing this and you
1384.159,3.76,have these two options install now or
1385.919,4.401,remind me later probably what you're
1387.919,4.24,going to do is hit remind me later and
1390.32,3.44,if you think about all the reminder me
1392.159,4.241,later that you've done in your on your
1393.76,5.2,own computer and i i certainly copped to
1396.4,4.56,doing it all the time myself um there's
1398.96,4.0,a ton of things that my computer needs
1400.96,3.52,to do that i never wanted to interrupt
1402.96,4.32,me to do because i don't know what the
1404.48,5.52,consequences might be and so this is the
1407.28,5.759,reason why so many computers are left
1410.0,4.559,not updated or vulnerable to you know
1413.039,3.841,all sorts of malware and stuff like that
1414.559,3.441,because you know we in practical reason
1416.88,2.88,um
1418.0,2.88,uh just ignore these things because
1419.76,3.039,we're not quite sure what the
1420.88,4.159,consequences are and i see jen has
1422.799,4.321,contributed a quick comment uh where
1425.039,6.321,yeah you understand what a bios is but
1427.12,6.96,even then this is quite confusing right
1431.36,4.72,i just another example just because just
1434.08,3.52,while we're at it um right so i told you
1436.08,3.28,that once you start to learn this stuff
1437.6,3.36,everything starts to look terrible but
1439.36,3.6,even if you haven't learned this stuff
1440.96,5.28,you can probably see this thing is
1442.96,7.199,pretty terrible uh this is um i took
1446.24,6.319,this in washington dc this i believe is
1450.159,5.361,uh it's like you get a ticket to use the
1452.559,3.841,subway uh with this machine
1455.52,1.759,and
1456.4,3.12,um
1457.279,4.081,i think if you use this all the time no
1459.52,3.84,big deal but i can tell you is the first
1461.36,4.4,time using this thing this is absolutely
1463.36,4.559,absurd um if you think about how reading
1465.76,4.24,works in north america normally you
1467.919,4.561,start reading from up here right top
1470.0,3.6,left you move right and then you go down
1472.48,3.04,um
1473.6,4.16,here the system is actually telling you
1475.52,3.519,okay look at the instructions and then
1477.76,3.279,over here there's in the middle there's
1479.039,5.041,this big loud thing that says this
1481.039,5.841,machine gives change in coins only right
1484.08,4.479,super loud right and then there are
1486.88,3.36,numbers that tell you to look at these
1488.559,3.761,different things like insert ticket here
1490.24,3.919,okay that's number one and then also
1492.32,4.4,insert validation but wait does number
1494.159,4.0,two mean insert coins uh and then how do
1496.72,3.68,i use this thing and when do i do this
1498.159,4.4,oh shoot there's an insert cash button
1500.4,4.399,over here um
1502.559,4.081,so maybe like presumably these are
1504.799,4.24,exclusive and then you can see take
1506.64,3.84,receipt is down here on the bottom left
1509.039,3.52,and also don't forget to take your
1510.48,3.679,change so there's a ton of things that
1512.559,3.521,are going on here and if you think about
1514.159,3.601,the engineering that is required to sort
1516.08,3.04,of make a machine like this happen you
1517.76,3.2,can kind of understand like different
1519.12,4.0,pieces parts of it are made at different
1520.96,3.12,times and stuff like this but really if
1523.12,2.799,you're thinking about the user
1524.08,3.68,experience of this machine i mean it's
1525.919,3.841,awful right like where do i start where
1527.76,3.6,do i end hopefully the way you do it is
1529.76,2.96,you start from the top left and kind of
1531.36,3.439,move to the bottom right and everything
1532.72,4.4,gets done um but i can tell you that
1534.799,5.041,this is in my view sort of a hopeless
1537.12,4.48,interface uh kind of uh in a walk up and
1539.84,2.56,use kind of situation
1541.6,2.72,okay
1542.4,3.36,i'm obviously overstating the case i was
1544.32,3.2,able to get my ticket and stuff like
1545.76,3.68,that but of course that takes time that
1547.52,3.759,takes whatever five minutes of my time
1549.44,3.52,and that's a real that's a real problem
1551.279,2.961,uh five minutes of my time means the guy
1552.96,2.719,behind me is waiting for me and getting
1554.24,2.16,angry at me
1555.679,2.401,okay
1556.4,3.84,so i'm just going to show you a couple
1558.08,3.36,other examples anastasia i apologize i
1560.24,4.64,said 20 minutes i think we're going to
1561.44,6.08,be 25. it's okay so you can uh you don't
1564.88,4.08,have to okay so anyway i'm just uh i'm
1567.52,2.88,just having too much fun kind of
1568.96,3.68,complaining about the world that i live
1570.4,4.32,in this is okay so i'm realizing now
1572.64,3.76,this may be a function of you know being
1574.72,3.28,trained in user experience design it
1576.4,2.96,could also be a function of the sort of
1578.0,2.88,being like an old man and just kind of
1579.36,2.799,complaining about how the way
1580.88,4.0,how the world is and how it could be
1582.159,4.081,better right okay so this is a kind of
1584.88,2.799,device that we're all becoming very
1586.24,3.6,accustomed with right a self-checkout
1587.679,3.201,machine
1589.84,3.6,and i'm like
1590.88,4.72,you know what i'm a savvy i'm a savvy
1593.44,5.119,young man uh i can use these things i
1595.6,4.24,don't need to you know read instructions
1598.559,4.48,so i come up to this thing and you can
1599.84,5.68,see here i was buying uh this is a
1603.039,4.401,carpet shampoo and uh
1605.52,3.44,it's an extension cable
1607.44,2.719,that detail is not important for this
1608.96,3.04,story okay so
1610.159,3.52,basically i'm like okay so i know how to
1612.0,3.44,use this thing like you just you know
1613.679,3.921,you know run the thing over and hit beep
1615.44,4.08,okay so i like pick up the thing and no
1617.6,2.959,beep and so i'm like okay that's kind of
1619.52,2.639,annoying
1620.559,2.801,so i see this sign says okay please
1622.159,2.481,press scanning to start beginning your
1623.36,3.199,transaction okay great and i looked at
1624.64,3.6,me okay please press start
1626.559,3.841,this is in canada so we need to have
1628.24,3.6,start in english and start in french i
1630.4,3.92,speak english primarily so i hit the
1631.84,4.079,start button and now i'm like okay good
1634.32,3.52,i'm good to go and i tried to do it
1635.919,3.921,again when i try to do it again it still
1637.84,3.92,doesn't work and then this is the moment
1639.84,3.92,where i decided to take a picture so you
1641.76,3.84,can see here that there's a sign here
1643.76,4.08,that says please press start scanning to
1645.6,5.199,begin your transaction so i have to
1647.84,4.559,press this button as well start scanning
1650.799,3.201,um and you might be saying hey didn't
1652.399,3.921,you already press start and the answer
1654.0,4.96,to that question is yes i press start
1656.32,5.28,two times i started twice before i was
1658.96,4.48,even allowed to start scanning this is
1661.6,4.319,again a minor hiccup but enough to kind
1663.44,5.119,of like you know make me annoyed right
1665.919,5.441,um so this is uh so the lesson here is
1668.559,4.801,that signs literally written signs uh
1671.36,3.52,and i think i said this earlier um are
1673.36,3.439,often a sign that the customer journey
1674.88,3.84,is unclear it's not clear what a person
1676.799,4.0,should do about this
1678.72,4.64,i'll show you one other example uh this
1680.799,4.88,is from a while back uh so signifiers in
1683.36,4.48,science can also be shapes of things
1685.679,4.801,i'll play the video and just explain
1687.84,3.52,simply that uh this was me
1690.48,2.319,uh
1691.36,3.28,at
1692.799,2.721,i was on a date so i was trying to like
1694.64,2.96,you know
1695.52,3.84,you know make a good impression uh and
1697.6,4.079,uh she was yeah anyway so i'll just play
1699.36,2.319,the video
1702.88,4.44,centered inside everything's good
1707.46,6.3,[Laughter]
1711.36,3.6,so once again
1713.76,2.08,oh
1714.96,2.16,okay
1715.84,2.88,so actually that means that you need to
1717.12,5.76,use two hands to use this thing well
1718.72,6.959,actually you can push it with this
1722.88,5.279,you can push this here oh
1725.679,4.321,nobody can figure that out right
1728.159,3.921,okay good
1730.0,3.679,okay so when i said okay that was the
1732.08,3.599,moment that i realized she thinks i'm an
1733.679,3.761,income poop and i'm never going out with
1735.679,4.48,this woman again
1737.44,4.0,actually uh everything ended fine but
1740.159,3.281,for the purpose of this story the thing
1741.44,3.119,i want to point out is that this this
1743.44,3.04,thing
1744.559,4.081,is shaped in a in a
1746.48,4.799,convex way so it kind of it bubbles
1748.64,4.96,outwards and my argument here is that if
1751.279,4.4,it was bubbled inwards so sort of the
1753.6,3.6,shape of the indentation of a cup then
1755.679,4.961,it would have been much clearer how to
1757.2,4.64,use this thing okay and uh and and
1760.64,3.039,here's some other examples where it's
1761.84,3.52,good here i just wanted to point out
1763.679,2.88,that you know sometimes we've all
1765.36,2.96,encountered this kind of thing where
1766.559,4.0,it's like opt-in opt-out who knows what
1768.32,3.92,i'm trying to do um and the fact that
1770.559,3.761,there's a long description you know who
1772.24,3.439,knows what that means sometimes my
1774.32,3.44,argument is that we call these things
1775.679,5.281,dark patterns because they're designed
1777.76,4.799,intentionally to mislead users so lots
1780.96,3.04,of interesting stuff in user experience
1782.559,2.641,design i know you might be thinking
1784.0,3.279,yourself look i'm not going to make that
1785.2,3.92,mistake but the thing is that you are
1787.279,3.52,typically not your user you have your
1789.12,4.48,own biases and blind spots and you are
1790.799,5.6,working on a team and so it's important
1793.6,5.92,to learn about techniques that help you
1796.399,4.801,to kind of arrive at better designs
1799.52,4.32,there's a bunch of user experience and
1801.2,4.079,hci jobs that you can get out there
1803.84,3.28,and they have all sorts of different
1805.279,3.28,names so the typical joke is you can
1807.12,2.799,pick one of these things on the left
1808.559,2.961,column here and combine it with
1809.919,3.521,something on the right column
1811.52,3.759,and boom there you have some sort of
1813.44,3.68,user experience job right so you can be
1815.279,3.441,a usability analyst you could be a
1817.12,2.88,usability engineer or a developer you
1818.72,2.319,can be an interaction designer or
1820.0,2.88,usability
1821.039,4.64,interaction engineer so here's the quick
1822.88,4.56,summary of my 20 turn 30 minute talk
1825.679,3.6,design is everywhere objects that you
1827.44,3.28,use web systems that you make use of
1829.279,4.161,tools apps
1830.72,4.72,physical environments libraries signs in
1833.44,4.4,libraries reports that you build
1835.44,3.68,good design is hard it's not easy
1837.84,3.76,poorly designed things have big
1839.12,4.32,consequences they're annoying to use and
1841.6,3.36,when you learn good design practices as
1843.44,3.52,you would in a user experience design
1844.96,5.599,program you can help
1846.96,5.92,make better designs so here's a quick
1850.559,3.681,thing some contact info for me i'm happy
1852.88,3.679,to answer questions if you want to reach
1854.24,4.559,out uh and i'm definitely 10 minutes
1856.559,7.081,over my time so i apologize anastasia
1858.799,4.841,i'm happy to hand the baton over to you
1865.76,3.759,okay just give me a second
1870.559,3.281,can you see my screen
1875.679,3.88,okay
1876.559,3.0,um
1881.76,4.399,okay
1882.799,5.521,hello everyone um i'm anastasia
1886.159,4.24,and uh tony
1888.32,4.64,showed you a lot of examples of that
1890.399,4.081,design and the reason why we started
1892.96,3.439,started this session was this part
1894.48,5.28,because indeed it's our highest priority
1896.399,6.961,right to learn how to avoid mistakes
1899.76,6.48,but another facet of our work is
1903.36,5.039,designing novel technology an
1906.24,4.88,understanding of what
1908.399,4.561,is needed so how to develop these truly
1911.12,4.48,new
1912.96,5.28,types of devices software
1915.6,4.959,and other technology often comes from
1918.24,4.96,academic research and so what i want to
1920.559,4.96,do today i want to give you a glimpse of
1923.2,5.12,how it might look like on the example of
1925.519,2.801,some of my work
1929.44,4.719,so i'm a researcher in hci as i
1932.32,4.4,mentioned earlier and my work in each
1934.159,3.601,day covers a rather broad range of
1936.72,2.559,research
1937.76,4.08,from development of different
1939.279,4.801,interaction techniques through creating
1941.84,4.559,multi-device ecosystems when we use
1944.08,5.439,different technology within it uh to
1946.399,5.601,informing architectural computer vision
1949.519,4.721,and so on and at some point i became
1952.0,3.039,fascinated by this idea that we've got
1954.24,4.72,two
1955.039,5.681,really intelligent uh powerful entities
1958.96,4.0,a human and a computer
1960.72,5.28,and what we're trying to do we're trying
1962.96,4.719,to put them together to make them uh
1966.0,4.399,talk to each other
1967.679,5.201,so that they can accomplish a richer set
1970.399,3.921,of tasks right and optimize what each is
1972.88,3.679,capable of
1974.32,5.28,and yet developing this communication
1976.559,6.48,between humans and computers um
1979.6,4.799,is uh really complicated and um it keeps
1983.039,4.801,being surprisingly challenging
1984.399,5.041,throughout our whole story of our field
1987.84,4.8,and if originally
1989.44,6.0,in 80s when hci was just starting
1992.64,5.44,um hcis field was mainly concerned with
1995.44,4.0,how to make computers so that humans can
1998.08,3.439,understand them
1999.44,4.719,then now especially with the development
2001.519,4.88,of machine intelligence the question is
2004.159,5.441,shifting to how to make humans and
2006.399,5.441,computers to understand each other
2009.6,4.16,and so on one hand it becomes
2011.84,4.64,more and more clear to all of us that
2013.76,4.72,our ability to create a partnership
2016.48,4.559,between humans and computers and
2018.48,5.52,integrate computers into natural
2021.039,5.921,communication is going to
2024.0,4.88,define what we as a society are going to
2026.96,4.0,be able to accomplish
2028.88,4.48,but on the other hand we learn again and
2030.96,5.36,again that building this successful
2033.36,5.36,communication even just between humans
2036.32,3.44,let alone humans and computers is very
2038.72,2.799,challenging
2039.76,4.24,so think about all the complaints we
2041.519,4.801,have heard during the last year and a
2044.0,3.84,half about the system supported
2046.32,4.0,communication and learning right for
2047.84,5.6,instance learning through zoom
2050.32,5.44,so in my work i study the mechanisms of
2053.44,4.399,this mediated communication
2055.76,4.639,and more specifically i
2057.839,5.76,explore this dynamic context
2060.399,5.28,that moderates mediates defines how we
2063.599,4.961,explore information how we share
2065.679,4.081,information how we perceive information
2068.56,2.64,in these different types of
2069.76,5.04,communication
2071.2,5.28,so why context and why information
2074.8,3.76,well because understanding what we as
2076.48,4.08,humans do and why we do it and
2078.56,4.559,understanding what's going on with us
2080.56,3.599,depends on understanding our current
2083.119,3.52,context
2084.159,4.48,so for machines to become for computers
2086.639,4.0,to become human collaborators
2088.639,4.881,in communication they need to learn how
2090.639,4.48,to understand and even reproduce this
2093.52,4.559,context
2095.119,5.281,and because communication in its core is
2098.079,4.801,an exchange of information the system's
2100.4,4.719,ability to work with people
2102.88,3.28,requires understanding of how
2105.119,3.761,why
2106.16,4.56,and when people share and don't share
2108.88,4.16,because no matter what system's
2110.72,4.16,performance depends on information and
2113.04,3.36,for the same information we as humans
2114.88,3.6,we're ready to share
2116.4,4.4,or perceive it in one context and we're
2118.48,4.08,completely against doing it in another
2120.8,3.92,context
2122.56,5.2,so uh today i want to talk to you about
2124.72,5.04,some of the aspects of this design for
2127.76,5.599,systems that aim to support this
2129.76,5.599,communication with uh both between uh
2133.359,4.401,humans uh right so human to human
2135.359,3.841,communication and human computer
2137.76,4.079,communication
2139.2,4.32,and um how to have these systems context
2141.839,4.161,aware so how to make them so that they
2143.52,4.72,can adapt their functionality and their
2146.0,3.76,behavior to the context and why it even
2148.24,3.92,matters
2149.76,4.48,so first let's think about what is
2152.16,4.0,communication and more specifically
2154.24,6.08,what's the difference between
2156.16,4.16,interaction and communication
2162.0,2.8,any thoughts
2168.079,3.601,it's actually a very complicated
2169.359,4.24,question
2171.68,4.08,so i'm gonna just for the sake of time
2173.599,5.76,i'm just gonna jump in um
2175.76,5.359,towards the answer so if we think about
2179.359,3.601,what is interaction communication in
2181.119,3.121,both cases it's an exchange of
2182.96,3.92,information
2184.24,4.24,between several parties right so it's
2186.88,5.12,always an exchange of information there
2188.48,6.08,are always at least two parties involved
2192.0,4.079,but in fact communication is a sub type
2194.56,3.36,of interaction
2196.079,3.52,and interaction becomes communication
2197.92,4.96,when we start thinking that the other
2199.599,5.76,side has some capacity to act
2202.88,4.56,independently so when you start thinking
2205.359,5.121,that the other side can make its own
2207.44,5.36,choices you suddenly start communicating
2210.48,4.08,instead of just purely interacting so
2212.8,3.039,maybe you have seen those funny videos
2214.56,5.279,when um
2215.839,6.081,an elevator is a voice intro voice um
2219.839,4.081,operated and then elevator doesn't
2221.92,4.08,understand people and people started
2223.92,4.56,yelling at it talking to it saying that
2226.0,4.079,is you know making fun of them so that
2228.48,5.28,is the moment when you shift from
2230.079,3.681,interaction to communication
2233.92,3.28,and so now
2235.2,4.8,with the development of this machine
2237.2,5.12,machine uh intelligence with machines
2240.0,4.64,becoming this communication actor
2242.32,4.24,instead of just an interaction actor now
2244.64,3.199,we can view these systems as forming a
2246.56,3.68,continue
2247.839,4.321,from communicating through technology
2250.24,4.8,such as zoom for instance skype
2252.16,4.32,different social networks so when people
2255.04,2.4,interact to each other through this
2256.48,3.28,system
2257.44,5.04,to communicating around technology such
2259.76,5.44,as monitoring systems large multi-user
2262.48,5.28,displays collaborative software to
2265.2,4.72,communicating directly with technology
2267.76,4.24,such as different conversational agents
2269.92,4.08,robots and so on like alexa google
2272.0,4.48,assistant and so on
2274.0,4.96,and so in my research i look at how
2276.48,4.16,depending on the place on this continuum
2278.96,3.76,these systems have different
2280.64,4.64,contributions that they can make to the
2282.72,4.8,communication process and so that is how
2285.28,5.839,we inform design from the research
2287.52,5.04,perspective to the actual product design
2291.119,3.281,so let's first look at the interaction
2292.56,4.4,through these systems
2294.4,4.24,for example teleconference assistance or
2296.96,3.84,let's say social networks they're
2298.64,4.16,designed to be a platform for
2300.8,3.52,communicating with other people
2302.8,4.64,but because this communication is
2304.32,5.12,mediated the users often don't have
2307.44,4.0,the full picture of who is on the other
2309.44,4.0,side so for instance who is reading our
2311.44,3.44,posts who can see and hear us on the
2313.44,3.28,screen let's say right now i'm on your
2314.88,4.0,screen i have no idea who's around you
2316.72,4.0,what's going on there i have no idea how
2318.88,4.64,you're reacting to what i'm saying right
2320.72,5.52,so i do not have this full picture
2323.52,4.079,and so since i do not have it uh and
2326.24,3.04,people do not have it we create
2327.599,4.0,something
2329.28,3.839,some kind of conceptualization of who is
2331.599,2.961,on the other side
2333.119,2.72,something that we call the imagined
2334.56,2.96,audiences
2335.839,4.801,and of course what we imagine is often
2337.52,6.319,very different from the reality and you
2340.64,5.199,could say so what why does it matter
2343.839,4.161,well it matters first of all because our
2345.839,4.0,imagined audiences so this these ideas
2348.0,2.64,of who is on the other side
2349.839,3.76,um
2350.64,5.04,determine how and what we communicate to
2353.599,4.321,the real people out there
2355.68,4.64,but it also defines our expectations on
2357.92,4.56,how the information is going to be used
2360.32,5.44,and perceived so you can think of all
2362.48,5.08,the uh issues around privacy about our
2365.76,3.839,sharing about
2367.56,3.96,misunderstandings and communication the
2369.599,4.081,efficiency of communication so all of
2371.52,3.52,that has to be supported by these
2373.68,3.679,systems
2375.04,3.52,and so because of that we show for
2377.359,3.201,instance in
2378.56,3.76,with my colleagues that the role of
2380.56,3.36,technologies through which this
2382.32,3.279,communication is happening so this
2383.92,5.04,technology is on the left side of the
2385.599,5.601,continuum the role becomes to gather
2388.96,4.96,this missing contextual information
2391.2,5.52,about the audience and to integrate it
2393.92,4.159,into the communication in a suitable way
2396.72,3.76,which doesn't necessarily mean of course
2398.079,4.641,to just spit it out to the user right no
2400.48,5.119,we need to be smart about it and we can
2402.72,5.52,develop different features um
2405.599,5.681,that would support this communication
2408.24,6.24,based on this contextual information
2411.28,4.64,for example online forums
2414.48,3.2,as one of the
2415.92,3.12,situations of communicating through the
2417.68,2.96,technology
2419.04,3.84,how can we integrate the missing
2420.64,4.479,information about the audience into the
2422.88,4.16,communication process here
2425.119,3.761,or for example we can present some
2427.04,5.12,information about the person right we
2428.88,5.76,can say how many posts they made
2432.16,4.72,with response to what message they are
2434.64,4.24,posting their answer right now we can
2436.88,3.92,show if they have some special status on
2438.88,2.719,this forum right for instance if they
2440.8,2.72,are
2441.599,3.76,an administrator or something like that
2443.52,4.0,so that is an example of how this
2445.359,4.561,information can be um
2447.52,4.319,embedded into the communication
2449.92,4.56,information that we can gather
2451.839,4.48,and then in bad in in in the process
2454.48,4.32,through the design
2456.319,4.8,in other examples on social media for
2458.8,4.24,instance when you can define uh who is
2461.119,4.96,going to see your post right or let's
2463.04,4.48,say stories in instagram you can see who
2466.079,3.04,watched it right
2467.52,3.839,but if you think about your experience
2469.119,5.601,of using these systems think about what
2471.359,5.841,doesn't really translate what is there
2474.72,4.32,when you're using let's say facebook
2477.2,3.6,that doesn't really
2479.04,3.36,that you would want to know about your
2480.8,3.36,audience but that is not supported
2482.4,3.439,through the design and let's say
2484.16,3.679,facebook researchers who are like more
2485.839,3.601,academic researchers that's that's the
2487.839,3.121,way how they're thinking about these
2489.44,3.679,problems right they go there and they
2490.96,4.32,start exploring what else is that that
2493.119,4.561,is missing and based on that new
2495.28,4.48,features are bringing up
2497.68,4.0,same with zoom right for instance what
2499.76,3.599,we're doing right now as i said let's
2501.68,3.76,say i have no idea what's going on with
2503.359,3.841,you right now there and even if
2505.44,2.96,everybody would have their videos on
2507.2,3.36,there is still
2508.4,4.4,a lot of this context about audience
2510.56,3.84,that is missing
2512.8,4.799,okay so when we communicate through the
2514.4,4.8,system the system needs to um together
2517.599,4.321,and integrate this information into
2519.2,4.399,communication and now if we move to the
2521.92,3.6,uh to the right on the continuum so to
2523.599,4.881,the middle we would find here the
2525.52,6.16,systems that are mainly announcing this
2528.48,5.119,ability of users to access and produce
2531.68,4.96,the information so these are the systems
2533.599,5.921,around which we're communicating
2536.64,4.719,um so the examples of such systems can
2539.52,2.88,include for instance public displays
2541.359,3.681,right or
2542.4,5.199,digital tabletops and they provoke these
2545.04,5.52,spatial interactions around them
2547.599,5.921,or it can be software for instance um
2550.56,4.08,different like my report right or google
2553.52,3.44,docs
2554.64,4.32,that you share and so software provides
2556.96,3.44,the interactions around content that
2558.96,3.44,they provide
2560.4,3.439,or help us to create
2562.4,2.4,so what do you think matters in this
2563.839,3.681,case
2564.8,6.64,what should the technology be doing to
2567.52,3.92,support this type of communication
2575.04,3.92,so because these systems in the middle
2576.88,4.8,are mainly augmenting this ability to
2578.96,5.2,access and produce information their
2581.68,4.56,main role becomes to provide this
2584.16,4.159,information in the best most
2586.24,4.0,contextually suitable form
2588.319,4.081,and what exactly it means depends a
2590.24,4.48,little bit on the type of the system for
2592.4,4.88,example for the um let's say large
2594.72,6.56,displays right or some physical systems
2597.28,5.839,this includes being able to adopt for
2601.28,4.88,let's say collaborative or competitive
2603.119,6.321,scenarios right or adopt for it for the
2606.16,6.24,um uh territoriality and praxamics
2609.44,6.24,around uh around the device so proximix
2612.4,5.04,is a uh field of the study that is
2615.68,4.24,concerned with um
2617.44,4.639,the the way how people organize their
2619.92,4.48,space their territory
2622.079,5.201,in the term was suggested and the field
2624.4,5.12,was started by edward hall who was a
2627.28,4.88,cultural anthropologist and what he
2629.52,3.839,suggested is that there this
2632.16,4.24,four
2633.359,5.681,circles that exist around people and the
2636.4,4.88,closest one is this intimate space then
2639.04,4.559,personal space then social space and
2641.28,3.839,then public space and depending on your
2643.599,3.201,relationship with people you're going to
2645.119,2.641,be standing on the on the appropriate
2646.8,3.6,distance
2647.76,4.559,between yourself so why is it why why
2650.4,3.52,why does it matter to us well for
2652.319,3.921,example when you're presenting
2653.92,4.24,information to the situation like let's
2656.24,4.16,say to an intimate couple right or to
2658.16,4.4,family you can support this more
2660.4,3.04,intimate interaction distance between
2662.56,3.44,people
2663.44,4.639,but let's say for the work situation you
2666.0,3.04,have to present information so that it
2668.079,2.641,would be
2669.04,3.44,would be within these appropriate
2670.72,2.879,distances as well
2672.48,3.04,right
2673.599,3.441,with software uh
2675.52,3.36,so that's for physical systems with
2677.04,3.92,software things become slightly more
2678.88,5.199,complicated but let's look at the
2680.96,5.119,example of um software for co-watching
2684.079,4.081,movies and videos
2686.079,3.52,so in this case people are communicating
2688.16,4.48,here
2689.599,5.121,around the content that this software
2692.64,4.56,provides right so what do these systems
2694.72,3.84,do to provide information in a suitable
2697.2,4.68,format
2698.56,3.32,any ideas
2706.72,2.72,anything goes
2712.8,5.48,on top right what what do you mean on
2715.28,3.0,top
2720.24,4.079,overlay on top yeah so the fact that the
2722.56,4.24,the chat is on the side right so the
2724.319,4.8,focus is only on the main content for
2726.8,2.319,sure
2729.52,4.319,you can see for instance here who paused
2731.44,4.8,the video right if so if somebody stops
2733.839,5.201,the video it stops for everyone
2736.24,4.72,um if uh so so the fact that chat is on
2739.04,4.0,the side yeah so that that the content
2740.96,4.24,is is on the left so there are a lot of
2743.04,4.079,aspects within it but you see here we're
2745.2,3.919,not focusing as let's say in the forums
2747.119,4.401,on providing this information about the
2749.119,4.321,audience instead we're focusing on the
2751.52,4.24,action right and we're providing
2753.44,4.32,information in the form in this suitable
2755.76,5.359,form
2757.76,5.52,okay so so far we have discussed that
2761.119,4.321,when we interact through this system
2763.28,4.24,this system should be gathering and
2765.44,3.76,integrating this missing context into
2767.52,3.76,the communication
2769.2,4.72,when we interact around technologies
2771.28,4.64,their role is to understand this context
2773.92,4.399,and provide the information in
2775.92,4.08,contextual suitable format
2778.319,3.361,and now let's look at what is happening
2780.0,3.839,when the interaction is taking place
2781.68,3.439,communication is taking place with the
2783.839,2.641,technology
2785.119,3.2,itself
2786.48,4.8,and so these systems on the right end of
2788.319,6.161,the spectrum are built around the idea
2791.28,5.039,of intelligent agents
2794.48,3.68,and this includes for instance chatbots
2796.319,5.921,voice activated assistants different
2798.16,6.56,types of robots social drones and so on
2802.24,5.119,and since the communication here happens
2804.72,5.599,with this intelligent agent the systems
2807.359,5.601,tend to be heavily anthropomorphized
2810.319,5.121,what is entropization it's when we start
2812.96,4.24,attributing life like human-like
2815.44,3.679,qualities to something that is not
2817.2,3.919,actually a life
2819.119,3.521,and in fact that is an evolutionary
2821.119,4.641,adaptation that is something that
2822.64,4.88,happens naturally mindlessly with people
2825.76,4.079,and that helps us
2827.52,5.12,to make sense of something that is
2829.839,4.801,complex right so that is the true moment
2832.64,4.16,when we're moving to the communication
2834.64,3.76,with the computer system from the pure
2836.8,4.319,interaction that is the moment when a
2838.4,6.48,computer stops being a pure tool
2841.119,6.561,and becomes a communication actor so how
2844.88,5.12,do you think it would affect the role
2847.68,5.679,and responsibility
2850.0,6.079,in this collaboration with humans
2853.359,4.48,well arguably the the responsibility of
2856.079,3.601,this technology is done to be a good
2857.839,4.881,communicator right to be a good
2859.68,5.12,communicator part department
2862.72,4.0,which includes both this ability to
2864.8,5.44,recognize this
2866.72,6.08,user's communication context and to
2870.24,4.56,match this context in communication with
2872.8,4.24,the user so from the system development
2874.8,4.16,perspective it's two different sites one
2877.04,4.0,thing is to understand what's going on
2878.96,4.48,and another thing is to reproduce this
2881.04,4.72,context in communication
2883.44,3.84,and this i will show you on the example
2885.76,4.079,of one of my
2887.28,5.2,studies with conversational agents to
2889.839,7.041,show you how this academic research can
2892.48,7.04,can inform the actual product design
2896.88,6.0,so the general purpose voice assistance
2899.52,5.839,such as alexa google assistant or siri
2902.88,4.8,for example they're becoming more and
2905.359,4.081,more popular as you might know and so
2907.68,4.639,more and more users are interacting with
2909.44,5.6,them on a daily basis
2912.319,5.441,and these systems in essence rely on
2915.04,4.079,users voice interactions with a persona
2917.76,4.72,for an agent
2919.119,5.921,who is deliberately designed to speak
2922.48,4.56,and act human-like
2925.04,3.68,and because of this the voice assistants
2927.04,4.72,end up being
2928.72,5.599,integrated in both technological space
2931.76,4.72,of the user's life so the ecosystem of
2934.319,3.921,devices in their life
2936.48,4.4,and at the same time in their social
2938.24,4.64,space so with whom our users communicate
2940.88,4.16,on a daily basis
2942.88,4.08,and so they tend to be antropomorphized
2945.04,5.2,right so again people start attributing
2946.96,4.96,this life like qualities and traits
2950.24,4.96,to these agents
2951.92,6.48,for example users flirt with them
2955.2,6.08,which in fact became so common that now
2958.4,5.199,in popular media people joke and make
2961.28,4.559,movies about it so maybe you've seen
2963.599,4.401,there was a movie called her or there
2965.839,4.881,was an episode on the big bang theory at
2968.0,5.44,some point about that or as on this
2970.72,4.639,image on this side right now hey siri
2973.44,4.159,siri says we need to talk who is this
2975.359,3.041,alexa person you keep flirting with
2977.599,2.561,right
2978.4,3.679,so it became a really
2980.16,4.159,a real social thing
2982.079,5.76,and you could say well that's cute but
2984.319,4.52,so what why does it matter to us
2987.839,3.121,well it matters because
2988.839,5.081,entrepreneurization and these processes
2990.96,5.28,heavily define the interaction style so
2993.92,4.72,how we talk to this system
2996.24,5.76,and also users expectations
2998.64,5.679,trust into the system and even use cases
3002.0,4.0,with this technology when people adopt
3004.319,4.161,these systems
3006.0,5.04,and yet we know very little about what
3008.48,5.28,happens when entrepreneurization occurs
3011.04,5.279,right so do we see let's say all agents
3013.76,3.76,um as the same type of a person in this
3016.319,3.121,case
3017.52,4.64,well intuitively probably
3019.44,5.6,not right but if not does it depend on
3022.16,4.72,us how we perceive them or on the design
3025.04,3.76,of the agent so let's say would it
3026.88,3.84,differ between how i perceive the same
3028.8,4.48,agent than you right would it depend on
3030.72,4.8,the user or would we perceive the same
3033.28,4.64,age in the same way right so we didn't
3035.52,4.559,know that before
3037.92,3.04,and so what we did know before is that
3040.079,2.24,when we talk about
3040.96,3.28,entrepreneurialization there are kind of
3042.319,4.8,two sides to it
3044.24,4.16,one side is that um there is this
3047.119,3.44,behavioral
3048.4,4.719,design so that is emotional
3050.559,4.401,responsiveness the way how whose robots
3053.119,4.321,for instance the way they move
3054.96,5.92,now how warm they are in their
3057.44,4.879,interactions their personality and so on
3060.88,3.92,and on the other side there is this
3062.319,5.04,physical or visual aspects of it so
3064.8,3.92,let's say facial expressions or body
3067.359,4.48,expressions
3068.72,5.68,so your roomba vacuum would have only
3071.839,5.601,behavioral traits only the way it moves
3074.4,5.919,and then your like a box sculpture for
3077.44,4.399,instance would have only visual ones
3080.319,3.601,and so by design of course voice
3081.839,4.321,assistants are capable of displaying
3083.92,6.0,mainly these behavioral aspects right
3086.16,5.04,the way how how they act and talk to you
3089.92,3.6,but what
3091.2,5.119,personality and behavioral aspects what
3093.52,4.16,aspects of this of this talking matter
3096.319,3.441,to users
3097.68,5.2,and is there any structure there do we
3099.76,5.76,think about them in the same way or no
3102.88,4.64,and so we thought that if there is any
3105.52,4.079,structure there then these perceptions
3107.52,3.76,should be consistently different for
3109.599,3.681,different agents right so let's ask a
3111.28,4.319,lot of people about how they perceive
3113.28,4.24,that several agents and see whether
3115.599,4.0,their parents there
3117.52,4.079,and we also thought that
3119.599,4.561,if there is some structure there then
3121.599,4.881,the way how people think about this
3124.16,4.8,personality of an agent would also
3126.48,4.8,define how they visual how users
3128.96,3.2,visualize these agents so
3131.28,3.44,how
3132.16,4.679,users think these agents would look like
3134.72,4.0,if they were
3136.839,4.28,humans and
3138.72,4.08,especially because agents um answer can
3141.119,4.081,include some visual references like for
3142.8,4.48,instance series i'd blush if i could
3145.2,5.76,right or i think it was google's i would
3147.28,5.44,hug you if i if i would have hands right
3150.96,4.0,so then uh if there are consistent
3152.72,3.52,differences with the way how they act
3154.96,2.639,then there should be consistent
3156.24,3.119,differences with the way how they are
3157.599,3.52,visualized as well
3159.359,4.881,and the only way how we can could look
3161.119,4.24,at it was to look to compare several uh
3164.24,2.96,agents
3165.359,4.321,so we took three agents alexa google
3167.2,3.2,home and siri and we first asked people
3169.68,2.159,to
3170.4,4.719,interact with them
3171.839,5.361,um to talk for a little bit and then we
3175.119,4.801,interviewed people so we talked to the
3177.2,4.48,to the participants and we asked them
3179.92,4.48,what are the like if these agents would
3181.68,5.04,be humans what would they be like what
3184.4,4.24,are their definitive characteristics
3186.72,4.8,and then as a third step we also ask
3188.64,4.959,people to create these visualizations
3191.52,4.319,for each of the agent
3193.599,4.801,so what did we learn there
3195.839,4.72,so the main highlight about the the
3198.4,3.6,perception of the character is that they
3200.559,3.441,indeed structured
3202.0,7.52,these perceptions and they're structured
3204.0,8.24,according uh five categories um
3209.52,4.319,of personality approachability sentiment
3212.24,3.839,towards the user professionalism
3213.839,4.961,intelligence and individuality so all of
3216.079,3.921,us think about agents in terms of these
3218.8,2.88,five
3220.0,3.52,five categories
3221.68,5.12,and it's indeed different for different
3223.52,5.68,ages so for example with approachability
3226.8,4.96,that's about how emotionally distant or
3229.2,5.639,approachable an agent is right and the
3231.76,7.599,distance and here includes agents being
3234.839,6.601,snarky closed off and often they're um
3239.359,5.281,given in the opposition of users
3241.44,5.119,willingness to engage with this agent
3244.64,5.52,and then the other side the approachable
3246.559,5.681,side is is agents being emotionally warm
3250.16,3.84,friendly willing to interact like
3252.24,4.64,feeling more like a friend being
3254.0,4.88,outgoing and chill
3256.88,4.64,another example here this sentiment
3258.88,5.92,towards a user that's about how genuine
3261.52,5.76,versus disingenuous an agent is towards
3264.8,5.44,a user and the genuine side is this
3267.28,5.76,being benevolent caring altruistic
3270.24,4.8,thoughtful really trying to help you
3273.04,4.88,and disingenuous side is this being
3275.04,5.759,inconsiderate indifferent for example
3277.92,5.439,pretending or about siri one of the
3280.799,5.76,participants said using her sas as a
3283.359,3.2,defense mechanism
3287.44,3.919,and so these behavioral perceptions are
3289.28,3.839,both structured along these five
3291.359,3.281,dimensions and are different for
3293.119,3.121,different agents
3294.64,5.199,and then we also looked at the visual
3296.24,6.4,perceptions and so we combined these
3299.839,5.681,visualizations into collages and we also
3302.64,4.56,created a cumulative visualization for
3305.52,3.92,each agent and you can see already on
3307.2,3.2,the slide that they are quite different
3309.44,2.96,for
3310.4,4.399,uh different agents
3312.4,3.52,and so we again identified there five
3314.799,3.76,different
3315.92,5.12,themes where these differences appear
3318.559,4.56,and for example um people were talking
3321.04,4.72,about the build like the physical built
3323.119,4.72,mainly about the height of an age and
3325.76,4.4,people were talking about the age so
3327.839,4.401,let's say alexa is generally perceived
3330.16,3.52,to be older and siri is perceived to be
3332.24,3.359,younger
3333.68,4.399,they have different facial expressions
3335.599,4.48,like let's say google seems stressed and
3338.079,4.081,they've got a lot of stuff and alexa is
3340.079,4.161,just maybe a little bit smiling and siri
3342.16,4.48,would be smiling a lot
3344.24,5.359,uh and then they also have different
3346.64,5.199,different clothing right and siri would
3349.599,4.401,have this daring personality was
3351.839,3.121,highlighted femininity so she would be
3354.0,3.28,wearing
3354.96,4.8,crop tops mini skirts
3357.28,5.12,heels google would have this
3359.76,5.839,stereotypically awkward persona and
3362.4,6.32,alexa would have this cozy and caring
3365.599,6.561,carrying a character with big sweaters
3368.72,4.72,warm like jeans running shoes
3372.16,2.959,and so on
3373.44,3.84,and so the cool thing about this study
3375.119,4.561,was that it showed us that indeed
3377.28,5.44,there is something in the design of
3379.68,5.52,these agents that defined this very very
3382.72,4.24,um consistent structure of our
3385.2,3.68,perception about them
3386.96,3.76,and so we found that in the design
3388.88,4.64,itself it was first of all the amount of
3390.72,5.2,information that this agents provide and
3393.52,4.319,the level of details there
3395.92,4.48,um also the interaction style of an
3397.839,3.441,agent so whether it's prompting you back
3400.4,4.08,um
3401.28,5.039,and how responsive it is to your prompts
3404.48,3.76,whether it's using jokes
3406.319,4.081,and the third part there was the voice
3408.24,4.079,characteristics itself right so in this
3410.4,5.04,case we can see that there are very few
3412.319,7.52,design aspects that then produce such a
3415.44,4.399,diverse perception of this agency
3420.079,3.76,and so they they attacked both
3422.079,3.841,behavioral perceptions and visual
3423.839,4.48,perceptions of this agent
3425.92,4.72,and so the main takeaway from this study
3428.319,4.401,and for the design is that first of all
3430.64,4.88,there's this extremely
3432.72,4.48,rich socially meaningful interpretation
3435.52,4.319,that comes from users
3437.2,5.359,uh interpretation of
3439.839,6.72,actions of this agent right and a lot of
3442.559,5.681,these interpretations are very um
3446.559,3.841,biased so there is a lot of social
3448.24,4.879,stereotyping that is happening there but
3450.4,3.84,the good news is that these stereotypes
3453.119,3.761,and these perceptions they're
3454.24,4.559,consistently dependent on particular
3456.88,4.959,elements of the system on particular
3458.799,6.081,design which gives us as design as
3461.839,5.681,technology designers a stable
3464.88,6.8,gateway to these perceptions as we
3467.52,6.4,develop voice based artificial agents
3471.68,4.48,and with that this is the summary slide
3473.92,4.56,of my of my talk um
3476.16,5.04,did i did i make it i almost made it um
3478.48,4.879,on time so we still have about three
