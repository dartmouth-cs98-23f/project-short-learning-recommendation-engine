8.32,4.319,10 usability heuristics for user
11.12,5.52,interface design
12.639,6.8,by nielsen introduction
16.64,4.799,jacob nielsen's 10 general principles
19.439,4.08,for interaction design
21.439,4.241,they're called heuristics because they
23.519,5.361,are broad road rules
25.68,4.48,broad rules rather obtain and not
28.88,4.48,specific usability
30.16,5.6,guidelines so here are the 10
33.36,3.92,general principles or heuristics by
35.76,4.639,nielsen
37.28,5.36,so number one visibility of system
40.399,5.121,status
42.64,4.079,the design should always keep users
45.52,4.32,informed
46.719,3.921,about what is going on through
49.84,4.399,appropriate
50.64,6.8,feedback within a reasonable amount of
54.239,5.041,time so when users know the current
57.44,4.16,system status
59.28,3.68,they learn the outcome of their prior
61.6,4.879,interactions
62.96,6.72,and determine next steps
66.479,7.601,predictable interactions create trust in
69.68,6.72,the product as well as the brand
74.08,4.32,so here are some tips number one is
76.4,5.6,communicate clearly to users
78.4,5.759,what the system's status no action with
82.0,7.2,consequences to users
84.159,5.041,should be taken without informing them
89.28,3.36,present feedback to the users as quickly
92.0,3.2,as
92.64,5.2,possible so ideally it should be
95.2,5.599,immediately
97.84,5.76,build trust through open and continuous
100.799,2.801,communication
104.72,5.359,now here's a real world example of using
108.32,3.759,this heuristic
110.079,3.441,so let's say for example in billboard or
112.079,5.121,in malls
113.52,5.599,so say see you are here so you are here
117.2,4.08,indicators on mall maps
119.119,3.521,how to show people where they are where
121.28,4.64,they currently are
122.64,5.599,to help them understand where to go next
125.92,3.44,so that's an example of visibility of
128.239,3.681,system
129.36,2.56,status
132.48,7.44,number two match between system
136.08,7.04,and the real world the design
139.92,3.76,should speak the user's language use
143.12,3.28,words
143.68,3.84,phrases and concepts familiar to the
146.4,4.32,user
147.52,6.24,rather than internal jargon
150.72,6.239,follow real world conventions
153.76,5.19,making information appear in a natural
156.959,3.761,and logical order
158.95,3.929,[Music]
160.72,5.12,the way you should design depends very
162.879,6.64,much on your specific users
165.84,6.56,terms concepts icons and images
169.519,4.321,that seem perfectly clear to you and
172.4,4.8,your colleagues
173.84,5.6,may be unfamiliar or confusing to your
177.2,4.48,users
179.44,4.56,when it designs controls follow
181.68,5.44,real-world conventions and correspond
184.0,4.319,to desired outcomes called natural
187.12,4.399,mapping
188.319,4.0,it's easier for users to learn and
191.519,4.481,remember
192.319,6.721,how the interface works this helps
196.0,7.2,to build an experience that feels
199.04,6.96,intuitive tips
203.2,4.24,ensure users can understand meaning
206.0,5.44,without having to go
207.44,6.24,look up a word's definition
211.44,3.439,never assume you understanding your
213.68,4.559,understanding of words
214.879,7.121,or concepts will match those of your
218.239,5.28,users user research will help you
222.0,4.56,uncover your users
223.519,6.561,familiar terminology as well as
226.56,6.08,their mental models around important
230.08,2.56,concepts
233.92,6.08,so here's an example of matching the
237.12,3.679,the system and the real world so when
240.0,3.84,oval
240.799,5.201,when soap stop controls so so these are
243.84,4.0,stove stock controls
246.0,4.239,much delay out of heating elements
247.84,5.44,that's why this is for this
250.239,4.321,and this control is for that this one's
253.28,4.799,for this and 40 so
254.56,4.799,it matches the layout so users can
258.079,4.641,quickly understand
259.359,6.481,which control maps to which heating
262.72,4.4,element so rather than having this maybe
265.84,5.12,in straight line
267.12,7.359,this one is better because it matches
270.96,6.48,the layout of the heating
274.479,5.201,element so that's an example of applying
277.44,7.039,this rule
279.68,8.72,number three user controls and freedom
284.479,6.561,users often perform actions by mistake
288.4,3.68,they need a clearly marked emergency
291.04,3.2,exit
292.08,4.24,to leave the unwanted action without
294.24,5.28,having to go through an extended
296.32,5.84,process when it's easy
299.52,4.08,for people to back out of a process or
302.16,4.0,and do an action
303.6,4.48,it fosters a sense of freedom and
306.16,4.8,confidence
308.08,4.399,exits allow users to remain in control
310.96,4.4,of the system
312.479,5.601,and avoid getting stuck and feeling
315.36,2.72,frustrated
319.039,8.241,tips support and do and redo
324.639,4.0,so that will of course make it easy for
327.28,4.96,us to
328.639,6.961,undo our mistakes and maybe we do
332.24,5.28,if it is okay show a clear way to exit
335.6,4.159,the current interaction like a cancel
337.52,4.32,button
339.759,6.0,and make sure the exit is clearly
341.84,3.919,labeled and discoverable
346.08,3.76,so here's an example so again digital
349.12,2.799,spaces
349.84,4.0,needs quick emergency exit just like
351.919,6.481,this physical spaces do
353.84,4.56,so for us the it would be
358.479,4.081,nice to know if you know that there are
360.479,5.44,emerging emergency exits
362.56,4.639,in a building so in case of emergency
365.919,5.521,you know where to
367.199,6.801,go out but the same is true with
371.44,3.84,software or design so there should be a
374.0,5.52,way for users
375.28,7.28,to get out of whatever they are in
379.52,4.72,so like cancel buttons or maybe you
382.56,5.04,committed a mistake you can undo
384.24,3.92,your errors so this is about user
387.6,4.4,control
388.16,7.68,and freedom the number four consistency
392.0,5.199,and standards users should not have to
395.84,4.24,wonder whether different
397.199,4.401,words situations or actions mean the
400.08,4.559,same thing
401.6,5.12,you have to follow platform and industry
404.639,5.12,conventions
406.72,5.84,jacob's law state that people spend most
409.759,4.961,of their time using digital products
412.56,3.759,other than yours so there they might be
414.72,4.0,using other products
416.319,3.28,than what you are using so users
418.72,3.44,experiences
419.599,4.481,with those other products set their
422.16,4.879,expectations
424.08,5.76,failing to maintain consistency may
427.039,7.761,increase the user's cognitive load
429.84,4.96,by forcing them to learn something new
434.96,3.2,so don't think that what you are using
437.199,4.881,is also what
438.16,7.2,they are using so again
442.08,6.239,you have to uh follow
445.36,4.8,standards and to be consistent so that
448.319,4.88,you will not be increasing the cognitive
450.16,4.879,load of users
453.199,4.081,so here are some tips improved
455.039,4.16,learnability by maintaining both
457.28,5.759,types of consistency which are the
459.199,6.0,internal and external consistency
463.039,3.121,maintaining consistency within a single
465.199,3.68,product
466.16,4.56,or a family of products is internal
468.879,3.76,consistency
470.72,3.28,so if you have a product or a group of
472.639,2.881,products then
474.0,3.199,there's some there should be something
475.52,5.04,consistent with
477.199,5.921,these products or the external one
480.56,4.4,so follow established standard in that
483.12,4.56,industry rather conventions
484.96,3.28,so these are external consistency so
487.68,3.12,what
488.24,3.519,is the industry doing so whatever the
490.8,4.88,industry is doing
491.759,7.361,you have to follow these conventions
495.68,6.16,especially if this is the acceptable
499.12,2.72,convention
502.24,3.04,so example of visibility heuristics
504.0,3.28,number four
505.28,4.16,checked encounters are usually located
507.28,4.24,at the front of hotels
509.44,3.519,this consistency meets customers
511.52,3.519,expectations so
512.959,4.08,if you are a customer you would expect
515.039,3.041,that the check encounters will be at the
517.039,3.521,front of
518.08,4.0,the hotels because that's the standard
520.56,2.8,so if you're going to arrange your if
522.08,3.12,you have a hotel
523.36,3.44,then you should place you should always
525.2,6.24,place your check encounter
526.8,7.76,at the front of hotels
531.44,6.32,so that's following standards
534.56,5.2,number five excuse me number five is
537.76,4.72,about error prevention
539.76,4.24,good error messages are important but
542.48,4.0,the best designs
544.0,5.04,carefully prevent problems from
546.48,5.12,occurring in the first place
549.04,3.919,so not just showing error messages but
551.6,4.56,we should prevent
552.959,3.841,the occurrence of errors either
556.16,4.239,eliminate
556.8,5.92,error prone conditions or check for them
560.399,3.281,and present users with the confirmation
562.72,4.559,options
563.68,6.96,before they commit to the actions
567.279,6.721,there are two types of errors slips and
570.64,7.199,mistakes slips are unconscious errors
574.0,6.32,caused by inattention so mistakes
577.839,4.481,are conscious errors based on a mismatch
580.32,4.959,between the user's mental model
582.32,3.68,and the design so these are the
585.279,4.481,difference
586.0,5.6,sleep again you're unconscious about it
589.76,4.48,but in mistake you're conscious about it
591.6,6.239,but unfortunately what you know
594.24,6.0,is not um
597.839,7.841,it's not about uh it's not much demand
600.24,9.36,the design
605.68,7.92,so tips prioritize your effort
609.6,7.359,prevent high cost errors freeze then
613.6,5.6,little crustaceans so
616.959,4.401,if you're creating and for example if
619.2,6.079,you're creating a
621.36,7.36,data entity program so you should your
625.279,5.601,program should validate the entries of
628.72,5.44,users first before
630.88,5.04,you will be able to see avoid slips by
634.16,4.799,providing helpful constraints
635.92,3.039,and good defaults
639.6,3.04,prevent mistakes by removing memory
641.6,4.64,burdens
642.64,6.08,supporting undo and warning your
646.24,2.48,users
651.2,4.079,so here's an example a real world
653.12,5.36,example
655.279,6.321,so guard rails so these are your
658.48,6.24,the orange one on a curvy mountain road
661.6,6.0,prevent drivers from falling off
664.72,5.52,clips you have to prevent them from
667.6,5.28,doing the error that is falling off
670.24,3.44,clips and what is used here are the
672.88,4.72,guard
673.68,6.96,rails number six
677.6,5.2,recognition rather than recall so
680.64,5.12,minimize the user's memory load
682.8,4.4,by making elements action and options
685.76,3.759,visible
687.2,3.68,the user should not have to remember
689.519,3.921,information from one
690.88,4.079,part of the interface to another
693.44,4.639,information required
694.959,4.641,to use the design example field labels
698.079,4.32,or menu items
699.6,5.28,should be visible to air or easily
702.399,5.68,retrievable when needed
704.88,6.32,humans have limited short-term memories
708.079,5.921,interfaces that promote recognition
711.2,4.48,reduce the amount of cognitive effort
714.0,5.36,required from the
715.68,6.0,users tips
719.36,3.039,let people recognize information in the
721.68,2.88,interface
722.399,4.0,rather than having to remember or recall
724.56,4.16,it or memorize it
726.399,4.081,offer help in context instead of giving
728.72,6.16,users a long tutorial
730.48,8.96,to memorize reduce the information
734.88,4.56,that users have to remember
740.399,6.801,so here's an example so
744.639,4.88,it's easier for most people to recognize
747.2,4.96,the capitals of the countries
749.519,3.521,instead of having to remember them so
752.16,3.359,how's that
753.04,5.12,here's an example people are more likely
755.519,5.921,to correctly answer the question
758.16,5.2,is lisbon the capital of portugal
761.44,3.76,rather than this question what's the
763.36,3.44,capital of portugal because
765.2,3.52,you say what's the capital of portugal
766.8,6.08,you have uh
768.72,7.52,you have to force the uh
772.88,6.32,the people to recall
776.24,5.44,but here they are just here to recognize
779.2,5.639,is this the capital or not
781.68,4.719,so it should be recognition rather than
784.839,4.521,recall
786.399,4.961,number seven flexibility and efficiency
789.36,5.2,of use
791.36,3.919,shortcuts hidden from novice users may
794.56,3.92,speed up
795.279,4.721,the interaction for the expert user such
798.48,3.68,that the design can cater
800.0,3.44,to both inexperienced and experienced
802.16,5.76,users
803.44,6.72,allow users to tailor frequent actions
807.92,4.08,flexible process can be carried out in
810.16,4.64,different ways
812.0,5.36,so that people can pick whichever method
814.8,5.76,works for them
817.36,4.56,tips provide accelerators like keyboard
820.56,4.8,shortcuts
821.92,6.0,and touch gestures provide
825.36,5.36,personalization by tailoring content and
827.92,5.2,functionality for individual users so
830.72,4.239,something that you can customize or
833.12,3.839,tailor
834.959,4.0,yes a little customization allow for
836.959,4.0,customizations users can make
838.959,4.88,selections about how they want the
840.959,2.88,product to work
844.24,4.159,so here's an example so this is the
847.44,3.68,regular row
848.399,4.88,for example this is the regular row so
851.12,5.12,regular rows are listed on maps
853.279,4.961,but locals so those who know the place
856.24,4.08,with more knowledge of the area
858.24,3.12,can take shortcuts so maybe instead of
860.32,4.16,doing this
861.36,3.919,they will be taking this role so that
864.48,4.32,means
865.279,7.36,that uh for experts
868.8,6.64,for those who already uh experts of the
872.639,5.841,of the software for example placing
875.44,5.6,shortcuts should be convenient to them
878.48,4.32,and that means that's flexibility and
881.04,5.2,efficiency
882.8,5.039,number eight aesthetic and minimalist
886.24,3.68,design
887.839,5.041,interfaces should not contain
889.92,6.08,information which is irrelevant
892.88,6.079,or rarely needed every
896.0,4.16,extra unit of information in an
898.959,3.521,interface
900.16,3.76,competes with the relevant units of
902.48,5.44,information
903.92,6.719,and diminishes their relative visibility
907.92,4.88,this heuristic doesn't mean you have to
910.639,4.801,use a flat design
912.8,3.839,it's about making sure you are keeping
915.44,3.6,the content
916.639,4.481,and visual design focused on the
919.04,4.0,essentials
921.12,3.279,ensure that the visual element of the
923.04,5.52,interface
924.399,7.041,support the user's primary goals
928.56,5.76,tips keep the content and visual design
931.44,5.12,of ui focus on the essentials
934.32,3.12,don't let a necessary element distract
936.56,3.68,users for
937.44,4.88,from the information they really need
940.24,2.56,prioritize the content and features to
942.32,3.28,support
942.8,2.8,primary goals
948.8,5.44,so here's an example the ornate tipa
952.56,4.079,this is the only dipa
954.24,5.12,may have excessive decorative elements
956.639,8.161,that can interfere with usability
959.36,5.44,like for example an uncomfortable handle
965.279,6.0,or hard to wash nozzles so
968.639,4.56,the nozzle may be hard to wash it looks
971.279,4.8,very good
973.199,3.76,rather than this one but you notice that
976.079,3.601,the nozzle
976.959,6.88,could be hard to wash and maybe the
979.68,4.159,handle is uncomfortable
985.519,6.961,number nine help users recognize
988.959,5.601,diagnose and recover from errors
992.48,3.279,error messages should be expressed in
994.56,3.839,plain language
995.759,5.44,there should be no error codes so
998.399,7.201,precisely indicate the problem
1001.199,4.401,and constructively suggest a solution
1006.48,3.52,these error messages should also be
1009.199,3.841,presented
1010.0,7.44,with visual treatment that will help
1013.04,4.4,users notice and recognize them
1018.399,3.761,so tip use traditional error message
1021.519,4.32,visuals
1022.16,3.679,like bold red text
1025.919,4.561,and then tell users what went wrong in a
1028.64,5.279,language they will understand
1030.48,6.559,and you have to avoid technical jargon
1033.919,5.841,and then offer users a solution
1037.039,4.8,like a shortcut that can solve the error
1039.76,4.799,immediately
1041.839,4.161,so maybe here is a real world example it
1044.559,4.0,chases you a wrong way
1046.0,3.84,so a wrong way sign of the road reminds
1048.559,3.841,drivers that they are
1049.84,4.56,heading the wrong direction and ask them
1052.4,4.32,to stop
1054.4,3.6,and maybe even better if they can place
1056.72,5.04,you something
1058.0,8.08,maybe where is the correct way so
1061.76,7.6,it is already a good example of
1066.08,6.64,usability risk number nine number ten
1069.36,4.8,help and documentation it's best if the
1072.72,4.079,system doesn't need
1074.16,3.759,any addition additional explanation
1076.799,2.88,however
1077.919,3.361,it may be necessary to provide
1079.679,4.0,documentation to help
1081.28,3.92,users understand how to complete their
1083.679,3.841,tasks
1085.2,3.28,help and documentation content should be
1087.52,3.84,easy to search
1088.48,4.0,and focus on the user's tasks keep it
1091.36,3.92,concise
1092.48,5.199,and list concrete steps that need to be
1095.28,4.56,carried out
1097.679,5.521,so here are some tips ensure that the
1099.84,5.199,help documentation is easy to search
1103.2,4.0,whenever possible present the
1105.039,3.76,documentation in context
1107.2,3.68,right at the moment that the user
1108.799,4.481,requires it
1110.88,4.64,so these concrete steps to be carried
1113.28,2.24,out
1115.919,3.521,so here's an example so information
1118.799,3.281,kiosks
1119.44,4.8,at airports are easily recognizable and
1122.08,5.92,sold customers problem in context
1124.24,4.64,and immediately so just imagine if you
1128.0,4.0,don't have
1128.88,5.84,something like this in airports or
1132.0,4.32,maybe even schools so there should be
1134.72,5.199,something like this that
1136.32,7.04,are ready to help maybe students
1139.919,6.0,so just a note to end this uh
1143.36,4.4,video presentation nielsen originally
1145.919,3.841,developed the heuristics for heuristic
1147.76,3.039,evaluation in collaboration with rolf
1149.76,5.039,molik
1150.799,7.12,in 1990 so that's molly nelson 1990
1154.799,5.281,and yeah four years later
1157.919,4.921,nelson refined the heuristics based on a
1160.08,4.24,factor analysis of 249 usability
1162.84,4.839,problems
1164.32,4.56,it's the nielsen 1984a to derive a set
1167.679,4.0,of heuristics
1168.88,5.679,with maximum explanatory power resulting
1171.679,4.961,in this revised set of heuristics
1174.559,3.041,the 10 hero 6 themselves have remained
1176.64,4.399,relevant
1177.6,5.6,and unchanged since 1994. when something
1181.039,5.201,has remained true for 26 years
1183.2,3.599,or more than more than 26 years it will
1186.24,3.84,likely
1186.799,5.441,apply to future generations of user
1190.08,5.28,interfaces as well
1192.24,13.28,that ends my video presentation thank
1195.36,10.16,you very much for viewing this video
