0.0,3.439,web development is the best job in the
1.92,3.68,world you build on a platform with
3.439,4.001,nearly 5 billion daily active users all
5.6,4.16,connected together like the neurons of a
7.44,4.48,global super intelligent brain a system
9.76,4.16,that can cure disease eliminate poverty
11.92,3.599,advance science and stuff like that but
13.92,3.84,mostly it's used to share memes create
15.519,4.161,parasocial relationships amplify drama
17.76,3.439,and most importantly make tons and tons
19.68,2.88,of money if you want to get into it
21.199,3.041,you're gonna need to know some stuff
22.56,4.16,like a lot of stuff in web development
24.24,4.16,101 we'll take a look at a 101 different
26.72,3.92,concepts that you'll need to know when
28.4,4.08,building full stack web apps this is the
30.64,3.759,internet it's a network of billions of
32.48,4.0,machines connected together what do you
34.399,3.68,write to it like mail no a lot of people
36.48,3.2,use it and communicate i guess they can
38.079,3.681,communicate with nbc writers and
39.68,4.0,producers alison can you explain what
41.76,4.08,internet is it was officially born on
43.68,4.16,january 1 1983 thanks to the
45.84,3.6,establishment of the internet protocol
47.84,3.199,suite which standardized the way these
49.44,3.52,computers communicate the internet
51.039,3.761,protocol is used to identify different
52.96,3.919,computers on the network by assigning
54.8,3.84,each one of them a unique ip address
56.879,3.68,these computers can then send data back
58.64,4.0,and forth with the transmission control
60.559,4.081,protocol it breaks data into a bunch of
62.64,3.2,small packets kind of like puzzle pieces
64.64,2.88,then sends them through a bunch of
65.84,3.44,physical components like fiber optic
67.52,3.599,cables and modems before they're put
69.28,3.199,back together by the receiving computer
71.119,3.281,you can think of the internet as
72.479,4.0,hardware but the internet is not the
74.4,4.16,same thing as the web the world wide web
76.479,3.921,is like software that sits on top of the
78.56,3.76,internet where people can access web
80.4,3.759,pages with the hypertext transfer
82.32,4.24,protocol what's special about it is that
84.159,5.201,it gives every page of content a uniform
86.56,4.8,resource locator or url humans typically
89.36,3.84,use a tool called a web browser to
91.36,4.0,access a url where it can be rendered
93.2,4.0,visually on their screen the browser is
95.36,3.759,called the client because it's consuming
97.2,4.0,information but on the other end of that
99.119,4.401,url there's another computer called a
101.2,4.0,server it received an http request from
103.52,3.52,the client then sent a response
105.2,4.16,containing the web page content these
107.04,3.92,are called http messages but more on
109.36,3.92,that later what's interesting is that
110.96,5.6,every web page has a unique domain name
113.28,5.28,like fireship.io or example.com a domain
116.56,4.239,name can be registered by anyone via a
118.56,4.4,registrar who's accredited by icann a
120.799,3.68,nonprofit responsible for overseeing
122.96,3.439,namespaces on the internet when you
124.479,3.361,navigate to a domain in a browser it
126.399,3.28,gets routed through the domain name
127.84,3.92,system that maps these names to an
129.679,3.681,actual ip address on a server somewhere
131.76,3.52,dns is like the phone book of the
133.36,3.68,internet now when you look at a webpage
135.28,4.319,the actual content you see is
137.04,4.32,represented by hypertext markup language
139.599,4.0,most browsers have devtools where you
141.36,4.0,can inspect the structure of the html at
143.599,3.921,any time to build your own web page
145.36,4.959,you'll want a text editor like vs code
147.52,4.799,an html document is just a collection of
150.319,4.081,elements where an element is an opening
152.319,3.92,and closing tag with some content in the
154.4,3.919,middle like a paragraph and heading it
156.239,4.321,also has elements that handle user input
158.319,4.241,like the select and input elements which
160.56,3.6,are used to build forms in addition
162.56,3.84,elements can have one or more attributes
164.16,4.24,to change their behavior for example an
166.4,3.68,input can have a type like text or
168.4,3.36,number which the browser will render
170.08,3.519,differently to collect the appropriate
171.76,5.28,value but the element that puts the
173.599,5.521,hypertext in html is the a tag or anchor
177.04,3.839,it's a link that allows one page to
179.12,3.759,navigate to a different page based on
180.879,3.921,its url these elements are nested
182.879,4.161,together in a hierarchy to form the
184.8,4.24,document object model or dom from the
187.04,3.919,root element a web page is split into
189.04,4.16,two parts the head contains invisible
190.959,4.0,content like metadata and a title then
193.2,3.679,we have the body for the main content
194.959,3.841,that the end user actually sees the
196.879,3.921,reason we wrap everything in tags is to
198.8,4.0,give browsers and bots hints about the
200.8,3.76,semantic meaning of the web page this
202.8,3.28,allows search engines to display results
204.56,3.36,properly and also helps with
206.08,3.76,accessibility for devices like screen
207.92,4.0,readers that allow anybody regardless of
209.84,4.64,disability to enjoy the content my
211.92,4.399,computer reads me the text bro smash
214.48,3.039,that like button and subscribe one of
216.319,3.92,the most common elements you'll come
217.519,5.041,across is div or division to define a
220.239,3.761,section of the webpage on its own a div
222.56,3.28,might not seem to do anything and
224.0,3.76,currently produces this plain black and
225.84,3.679,white website that begs the question how
227.76,3.199,do we make this website look cool the
229.519,3.92,second language you'll need to learn as
230.959,4.56,a web developer is cascading stylesheets
233.439,4.401,or css which allows you to change the
235.519,3.92,appearance of the html elements one way
237.84,3.759,to accomplish that is with an inline
239.439,4.0,style using the style attribute on an
241.599,4.161,element the style itself contains a
243.439,3.761,collection of properties and values that
245.76,3.039,change the appearance of the element
247.2,3.599,like we might make the background color
248.799,3.841,black and the text color red what we've
250.799,3.681,created here is an inline style that
252.64,4.159,will only be applied to this one element
254.48,4.08,however css cascades which means it can
256.799,3.28,be applied to multiple elements at the
258.56,3.44,same time providing better code
260.079,4.081,reusability another option is to move
262.0,3.84,our code into a style tag but to make
264.16,3.759,the code work we'll first need to define
265.84,4.56,a selector so it knows which elements to
267.919,4.081,target a selector for example can target
270.4,3.84,all of the paragraph elements on the
272.0,4.56,page but that's too broad we can be more
274.24,3.84,granular by defining a class that style
276.56,3.28,can then be applied to one or more
278.08,3.28,elements with the class attribute what's
279.84,3.52,interesting though is that we now have
281.36,4.24,classes that apply different styles to
283.36,4.16,the same element css contains a bunch of
285.6,3.76,specificity rules that determine which
287.52,3.6,styles are relevant to an element in a
289.36,3.76,way that's self-evident and elegant like
291.12,4.0,a benevolent elephant most often though
293.12,3.84,we don't use style tags but instead use
295.12,3.2,an external style sheet which is linked
296.96,3.6,to the webpage and the head of the
298.32,4.08,document when it comes to css by far the
300.56,3.68,most difficult thing to learn is layout
302.4,4.0,and positioning think of every element
304.24,4.239,like a box the outside of that box is
306.4,4.0,wrapped with padding border and margin
308.479,3.841,the boxes then take up space on the page
310.4,4.0,from top to bottom some elements like
312.32,3.76,heading have a display of block by
314.4,3.519,default which means they take up all
316.08,3.92,available horizontal space other
317.919,3.041,elements like image are displayed inline
320.0,3.28,which means they can line up
320.96,4.32,horizontally side by side the problem is
323.28,3.68,that the default position is usually not
325.28,3.6,desirable it can be changed by
326.96,4.079,customizing the position property on an
328.88,3.599,element relative positioning allows an
331.039,3.761,element to move a certain number of
332.479,4.481,pixels from its normal position absolute
334.8,4.08,positioning is similar but the position
336.96,3.36,values are relative to its nearest
338.88,3.28,ancestor and then we have fixed
340.32,3.599,positioning which will keep an element
342.16,3.599,on the screen even as the user scrolls
343.919,3.681,away from it because it's fixed to the
345.759,3.361,entire viewport changing the position of
347.6,3.36,an element is one thing but one of the
349.12,4.16,biggest challenges web developers face
350.96,4.0,is creating responsive layouts users can
353.28,3.12,access your web page from all kinds of
354.96,3.76,different screens and it should look
356.4,3.76,good on all of them css provides a bunch
358.72,3.68,of different tools to help make this
360.16,3.84,happen one of which is media queries a
362.4,3.28,media query allows you to get
364.0,3.199,information about the device that's
365.68,3.44,rendering the web page and apply
367.199,3.681,different styles accordingly but more
369.12,4.079,importantly it provides layout tools
370.88,4.319,like flexbox applying display flex
373.199,4.081,allows the parent to control the flow of
375.199,4.401,the children to easily create rows and
377.28,4.16,columns for more complex layouts display
379.6,3.92,grid can be used to control multiple
381.44,4.319,rows and columns at the same time now
383.52,4.0,css is usually not considered a turing
385.759,3.761,complete programming language on its own
387.52,4.399,however it does have mechanisms like
389.52,4.0,calc to perform mathematical operations
391.919,3.761,and custom properties which are like
393.52,4.399,variables that you can reuse in multiple
395.68,3.76,places vanilla css is rarely enough
397.919,3.601,though and many developers choose to
399.44,3.84,extend it with tools like sas that add
401.52,3.2,additional programmatic features on top
403.28,2.96,of it and that brings us to the third
404.72,3.759,language you'll need to know as a web
406.24,3.92,developer javascript technically you
408.479,3.361,don't need javascript to build a website
410.16,3.2,however most developers choose to use it
411.84,3.359,to make the user interface more
413.36,4.16,interactive to run javascript code on a
415.199,4.0,web page open up a script tag then write
417.52,3.6,some javascript code inside of it the
419.199,3.44,browser interprets the html from top to
421.12,3.519,bottom and runs this code when it
422.639,3.921,encounters it in the dom in most cases
424.639,3.521,javascript is written in a separate file
426.56,3.28,then referenced as the source on the
428.16,3.599,script tag usually it's preferred that
429.84,3.6,this code runs after the dom content has
431.759,3.921,loaded which can be accomplished with
433.44,3.84,the defer attribute js is a big
435.68,3.76,complicated programming language which
437.28,4.24,is more formally known as ecmascript and
439.44,3.36,is standardized in all major browsers
441.52,3.119,there are several different ways to
442.8,3.76,declare a variable a variable that might
444.639,3.68,be reassigned in the future uses the let
446.56,4.0,keyword while a variable that can't be
448.319,3.921,reassigned uses const it's a dynamically
450.56,3.28,typed language which means no type
452.24,3.6,annotations are necessary that's not
453.84,3.759,always ideal so many developers choose
455.84,3.919,typescript as an alternative to add
457.599,3.44,static typing on top of javascript now
459.759,3.28,one of the most common reasons you would
461.039,3.761,use javascript in the first place is to
463.039,3.6,handle events whenever the user does
464.8,3.92,something on a web page the browser
466.639,4.481,emits an event that you can listen to
468.72,4.159,like a click mouse move form input
471.12,4.24,change and so on we can tap into these
472.879,4.16,events using browser apis like document
475.36,3.519,which in this case provides a method
477.039,4.241,called query selector that allows us to
478.879,4.241,grab an element with a css selector once
481.28,3.68,we have that element set as a variable
483.12,4.0,we can then assign an event listener to
484.96,4.56,it an event listener is a function that
487.12,4.4,will be called or re-executed anytime
489.52,3.92,the button is clicked the language has a
491.52,4.079,variety of built-in data structures like
493.44,4.08,an array to represent a collection of
495.599,4.0,values but the most fundamental data
497.52,4.239,structure is the object also commonly
499.599,3.761,called a dictionary or hashmap anything
501.759,3.361,that's not a primitive type like a
503.36,3.92,string or number inherits its base
505.12,4.16,functionality from the object class it
507.28,3.68,relies on a technique called prototypal
509.28,3.84,inheritance where an object can be
510.96,4.16,cloned multiple times to create a chain
513.12,3.599,of ancestors where the child inherits
515.12,3.12,the properties and methods of its
516.719,3.281,ancestors this is different from
518.24,3.52,class-based inheritance which is kind of
520.0,4.08,confusing because javascript also
521.76,4.639,supports classes however these classes
524.08,3.68,are just syntactic sugar for prototypal
526.399,3.041,inheritance but now we're getting a
527.76,2.88,little too low level most developers
529.44,3.12,don't ever want to have to touch the
530.64,4.0,word prototype so what we do instead is
532.56,4.16,use a front-end framework like react
534.64,3.84,view spelt angular and so on all of
536.72,3.119,these frameworks do the same thing in a
538.48,3.84,slightly different way which is
539.839,5.281,represent the ui as a tree of components
542.32,4.8,a component can encapsulate html css and
545.12,4.159,javascript into a format that looks like
547.12,3.76,its own custom html element most
549.279,3.921,importantly they produce declarative
550.88,4.079,code that describes exactly what the ui
553.2,3.28,does and that's much easier to work with
554.959,3.201,than imperative code that you would
556.48,3.2,normally get with just plain vanilla
558.16,3.119,javascript at this point we've taken a
559.68,3.36,look at the frontend stack but now we
561.279,3.68,need to switch gears to the back end
563.04,4.0,starting with nodejs which is a
564.959,3.601,server-side runtime based on javascript
567.04,3.12,you can run server-side code for web
568.56,3.52,applications in all kinds of different
570.16,3.6,languages but node is the most popular
572.08,3.439,because it relies on the same language
573.76,3.68,as the browser it's also based on the
575.519,4.241,same v8 engine that powers the chromium
577.44,4.32,browser to run code in a single threaded
579.76,4.079,non-blocking event loop this allows node
581.76,4.0,to handle many simultaneous connections
583.839,4.081,quickly and efficiently in addition it
585.76,4.079,allows developers to share work remotely
587.92,4.0,thanks to the node package manager a
589.839,4.241,package is also called a module which is
591.92,4.32,just a file that contains some code with
594.08,4.0,an export statement so it can be used in
596.24,4.4,another file the file can consume a
598.08,4.16,module with an import statement but now
600.64,3.759,we need to think about how to deliver
602.24,4.56,the actual website from the server to
604.399,4.081,the client the classic option is server
606.8,3.84,side rendering in this approach the
608.48,4.799,client will make a get request for a
610.64,4.56,certain url every request has an http
613.279,3.921,method and git means you want to
615.2,4.079,retrieve data from a server as opposed
617.2,4.24,to methods like post and patch where the
619.279,3.921,intent is to modify data the server
621.44,4.079,receives the request and then generates
623.2,4.16,all the html on the server and sends it
625.519,4.401,back to the client as a response the
627.36,5.28,response contains a status code like 200
629.92,4.56,for success or levels 4 and 500 for
632.64,3.759,errors for example if the web page
634.48,4.16,doesn't exist the server will return a
636.399,4.641,404 status code which you've likely seen
638.64,4.8,before as a web user ssr is extremely
641.04,4.4,popular but in some cases it may not be
643.44,3.76,fast enough another approach is the
645.44,3.92,single page application with this
647.2,4.4,approach the server only renders a shell
649.36,4.159,for the root url then javascript handles
651.6,4.16,the rendering for all other pages on the
653.519,4.081,website the html is generated almost
655.76,3.36,entirely client-side in the browser
657.6,3.76,making the website feel more like a
659.12,4.48,native ios or android app when the app
661.36,4.24,needs more data it still makes an http
663.6,4.4,request but only requests a minimal
665.6,4.08,amount of data as json which is called a
668.0,3.68,data interchange format that can be
669.68,3.36,understood by any programming language
671.68,3.04,this can result in a great user
673.04,3.84,experience however it can be very
674.72,4.08,difficult for bots like search engines
676.88,4.16,and social media link previews to
678.8,4.08,understand content on the page this led
681.04,3.84,to another rendering strategy called
682.88,4.079,static site generation in this case
684.88,4.32,every webpage on the site is uploaded to
686.959,3.841,a server in advance allowing bots to get
689.2,3.52,the information they need a front-end
690.8,4.08,javascript framework usually takes over
692.72,4.239,to hydrate the html to make it fully
694.88,3.68,interactive and behave like a single
696.959,2.961,page application performance is
698.56,3.2,extremely important and you'll want to
699.92,3.76,use tools like lighthouse to optimize
701.76,3.84,metrics like first contentful paint and
703.68,3.599,time to interactive now to implement one
705.6,4.32,of these patterns most developers will
707.279,5.12,use a full stack framework like next js
709.92,4.159,ruby on rails laravel and so on they
712.399,3.201,abstract away many of the more tedious
714.079,3.521,things developers don't want to deal
715.6,3.76,with one of which is module bundlers
717.6,3.84,which are tools like webpack and veed
719.36,4.24,that take all of your javascript css and
721.44,3.839,html and package it in a way that can
723.6,4.0,actually work in a browser they might
725.279,3.68,also provide a linter like eslint to
727.6,3.2,warn you when your code doesn't follow
728.959,3.361,the proper style guidelines oh and i
730.8,3.52,almost forgot you are definitely going
732.32,3.36,to need a database to build a full stack
734.32,3.44,web application because you need
735.68,3.839,somewhere to store your data like data
737.76,3.28,about your users but in order to get
739.519,4.0,that data you'll need to give users a
741.04,4.32,way to log in via a process called user
743.519,3.44,authentication now before you deploy
745.36,3.44,your code you'll need to test it with a
746.959,4.56,web server there are tools like nginx
748.8,4.24,and apache you create an http server but
751.519,3.521,your framework will likely do this for
753.04,3.76,you by serving the files on localhost
755.04,3.52,which makes your own ip address behave
756.8,3.599,like a remote web server when it comes
758.56,4.32,time to deploy you'll likely use a big
760.399,4.401,cloud provider like aws most apps are
762.88,3.92,containerized with docker making them
764.8,3.52,easy to scale up and down based on the
766.8,2.96,amount of traffic that they receive
768.32,3.68,there are many tools out there that
769.76,3.92,function as a platform as a service to
772.0,3.36,manage this infrastructure for you in
773.68,3.279,exchange for your money or if you don't
775.36,3.36,want to get locked in with a giant tech
776.959,4.081,corporation you might host your app on a
778.72,3.76,decentralized blockchain with web3 and
781.04,3.28,that's about one percent of what you'll
782.48,3.44,need to know to call yourself a full
784.32,3.6,stack web developer if that seems
785.92,3.28,overwhelming don't worry too much almost
787.92,2.8,nobody knows what the hell they're doing
789.2,3.6,and we all just use google to figure
790.72,4.239,things out on the fly congratulations
792.8,4.0,you just passed web development 101
794.959,4.641,thanks for watching and i will see you
796.8,2.8,in the next one
