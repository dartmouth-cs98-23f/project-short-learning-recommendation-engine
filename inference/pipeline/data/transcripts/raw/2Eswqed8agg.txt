0.399,4.321,this episode is brought to you by
2.159,2.561,brilliant
4.799,4.401,since the dawn of computing a single
7.04,4.8,construct has served as the focal point
9.2,4.16,of this transformational technology the
11.84,3.839,algorithm
13.36,4.16,by definition an algorithm is simply a
15.679,4.001,finite sequence of instructions
17.52,4.16,structured to solve a problem
19.68,3.759,in modern digital computers these
21.68,4.32,instructions resolve down to the
23.439,5.041,manipulation of information represented
26.0,5.119,by distinct binary states
28.48,4.96,these bits may be abstractly represented
31.119,5.12,by various physical phenomena such as
33.44,5.68,mechanical optical magnetic or electric
36.239,5.441,methods and the process by which the
39.12,4.88,binary information is manipulated is
41.68,4.16,also similarly versatile with
44.0,4.16,semiconductors being the most prolific
45.84,4.719,medium of these machines
48.16,4.239,fundamentally a binary computer moves
50.559,4.961,individual bits of data through a
52.399,5.441,handful of logic gate types these gates
55.52,4.48,have clearly defined binary outputs in
57.84,4.559,response to binary inputs and by
60.0,5.04,combining layers of these gates into
62.399,5.441,massive networks a deterministic
65.04,5.119,processing machine can be created a cpu
67.84,5.04,for example is a complex manifestation
70.159,4.801,of just such a machine
72.88,4.8,the flow and manipulation of digital
74.96,4.56,information is abstract by nature the
77.68,4.32,underlying physical medium only
79.52,5.52,determines the packaging performance
82.0,4.72,cost and practicality of its use but not
85.04,4.16,its inherent behavior
86.72,4.079,in digital computing binary information
89.2,3.44,moves through a processing machine in
90.799,4.081,discrete steps of time
92.64,4.64,the duration of these steps are limited
94.88,4.48,by the speed at which logic states can
97.28,3.76,be physically changed as information
99.36,4.16,propagates throughout the underlying
101.04,5.039,logic gate network inherently making
103.52,4.879,time a computing resource
106.079,4.4,in addition the capacity of a processing
108.399,4.4,machine to temporarily store and
110.479,4.32,manipulate information within itself
112.799,3.92,permits even more elaborate forms of
114.799,4.081,processing to be done
116.719,5.601,this in effect makes memory another
118.88,5.68,fundamental computing resource
122.32,4.32,because any series of instructions
124.56,4.399,tasked to solve a problem are confined
126.64,3.92,to the bounds of computing resources
128.959,4.081,algorithms designed for digital
130.56,5.2,computers can be classified by their use
133.04,5.68,of these resources as they scale this is
135.76,5.199,known as an algorithm's complexity
138.72,4.96,the most time efficient algorithms are
140.959,4.961,categorized as constant time
143.68,4.08,constant time algorithms always take the
145.92,4.64,same amount of time to execute
147.76,4.64,regardless of the size of the input
150.56,4.56,an example of such an algorithm would be
152.4,5.919,one that determines if a number is even
155.12,5.36,or odd to accomplish this only the last
158.319,4.401,digit of a number needs to be examined
160.48,3.92,no matter how large it is
162.72,4.799,because only one number is always
164.4,5.919,examined for any input size the solution
167.519,4.08,is always produced in one fixed duration
170.319,3.361,of time
171.599,5.041,algorithms can also scale in compute
173.68,4.96,time at a constant rate these are known
176.64,4.0,as linear time algorithms and they
178.64,3.519,execute at a rate that is directly
180.64,3.04,correlated to the size of the
182.159,3.761,algorithm's input
183.68,4.559,this characteristic becomes obvious with
185.92,4.16,a basic addition algorithm
188.239,4.241,the sequence starts with the rightmost
190.08,4.72,digit pairs being added from here the
192.48,5.2,algorithm then moves left to the next
194.8,5.04,pair of digits adding any carryover and
197.68,3.279,the process is repeated until no digits
199.84,3.039,are left
200.959,4.0,because the number of steps and
202.879,4.401,inherently the execution time is
204.959,3.681,directly determined by the size of the
207.28,4.8,number inputs
208.64,5.519,the algorithm scales linearly in time
212.08,4.4,constant and linear time algorithms
214.159,4.401,generally scale to practical execution
216.48,3.039,times in common use cases
218.56,3.28,however
219.519,4.481,one category of algorithm in particular
221.84,5.039,suffers from the characteristic of
224.0,4.959,quickly becoming impractical as it grows
226.879,4.161,let's look at an algorithm that must be
228.959,4.56,designed to search for a four-digit
231.04,4.24,numeric code this algorithm calls upon
233.519,3.681,another constant time algorithm that
235.28,5.12,will validate if the numeric code is
237.2,5.679,correct signaling the end of the search
240.4,4.08,with no prior information to go on the
242.879,4.0,search algorithm must cycle through
244.48,4.56,every single four-digit permutation
246.879,4.321,until a valid code is found
249.04,4.96,this is known as the brute force method
251.2,4.72,and for a four-digit code up to 10 000
254.0,3.919,codes must be tested by the validation
255.92,5.279,call with the code being found on
257.919,5.28,average by the 5 000th try
261.199,4.321,while this isn't particularly noteworthy
263.199,4.881,for modern processors a problem soon
265.52,4.8,arises as this brute force algorithm is
268.08,4.48,forced to deal with larger codes
270.32,4.72,with a five digit code one hundred
272.56,4.56,thousand combinations now possible at
275.04,4.4,six it becomes one million
277.12,4.32,with each digit added to the code the
279.44,4.16,number of possible combinations
281.44,3.84,increases tenfold from the previous
283.6,3.84,number of combinations
285.28,5.28,since testing each combination requires
287.44,4.96,a constant period of time to execute the
290.56,5.04,overall time to execute the brute force
292.4,5.2,algorithm rises exponentially as digits
295.6,3.92,are added to the code
297.6,4.24,this is known as an exponential time
299.52,4.16,algorithm and they pose a huge problem
301.84,4.24,for traditional computers as the
303.68,5.16,execution time can quickly grow to an
306.08,4.399,impractical level as input size
308.84,3.0,increases
310.479,4.241,problems that exhibit this
311.84,5.04,characteristic are known as intractable
314.72,4.0,they can in theory be solved but require
316.88,3.759,far too much time or memory to
318.72,4.24,practically arrive at a solution with
320.639,4.161,current computing technology
322.96,3.6,while intractable problems can be viewed
324.8,3.119,as a computational hindrance or a
326.56,3.68,limitation
327.919,4.641,their nature also lends themselves well
330.24,4.64,for security purposes such as in the
332.56,4.56,case of asymmetric encryption
334.88,4.56,the rsa algorithm for example forms the
337.12,4.4,basis for much of the encryption we use
339.44,4.08,including the encryption mechanism that
341.52,4.88,secures the internet
343.52,5.679,at its core rsa secured by the fact that
346.4,5.2,factorizing a large number to find its
349.199,5.041,two large prime number factors is an
351.6,4.719,intractable problem
354.24,4.64,this problem is so difficult for modern
356.319,4.88,computers that in 2020 it took a
358.88,5.84,supercomputer the equivalent of almost
361.199,6.881,2500 years per cpu core to find the
364.72,5.52,prime factors for a 250 digit number
368.08,4.399,at present to threaten the most commonly
370.24,5.6,used rsa encryption the ability to
372.479,5.44,factorize a 617-digit number is needed
375.84,5.04,it's estimated that at present it would
377.919,6.241,take almost 3 trillion years per cpu
380.88,5.439,core to accomplish this
384.16,4.159,in the early 20th century physicists
386.319,4.32,began to develop new ways to describe
388.319,4.0,the seemingly unintuitive behavior of
390.639,2.881,the most elemental interactions in
392.319,3.921,physics
393.52,4.88,called quantum mechanics these concepts
396.24,4.399,revealed an entirely new perspective on
398.4,5.2,how reality functions at the most
400.639,5.84,fundamental levels of observation
403.6,4.719,by 1980 physicist paul benioff would go
406.479,4.641,on to propose applying the principles of
408.319,4.641,quantum mechanics to computation
411.12,3.6,physicist richard feynman would soon
412.96,4.239,suggest that such a computer had the
414.72,4.96,potential to simulate things a classical
417.199,4.801,computer could not feasibly do and by
419.68,4.639,1986 he would propose the earliest
422.0,4.08,concepts for quantum computational
424.319,3.921,circuits
426.08,3.92,from these initial conjectures computer
428.24,4.16,scientists soon discovered that in
430.0,4.96,theory they could exploit this newly
432.4,4.96,discovered offshoot of quantum mechanics
434.96,5.44,to create more efficient algorithms
437.36,4.559,problems such as factorization that were
440.4,3.519,believed to be intractable for
441.919,4.161,conventional computers now had the
443.919,4.56,potential to be completely manageable
446.08,4.72,with a quantum computer
448.479,4.081,much like how digital systems use bits
450.8,4.16,to express their fundamental unit of
452.56,4.8,information quantum computers use an
454.96,4.239,analog called a qubit
457.36,4.239,however a qubit behaves dramatically
459.199,4.56,different than a traditional digital bit
461.599,5.201,in traditional bits only two discrete
463.759,4.801,states exist one and zero
466.8,3.76,these states are generally defined by
468.56,5.039,two clearly distinguishable physical
470.56,5.039,properties in the case of semiconductors
473.599,3.521,voltage levels are used
475.599,3.761,when a bit signal is applied to a
477.12,4.4,digital logic gate typically some form
479.36,4.08,of active switching occurs where an
481.52,5.119,input state triggers either an
483.44,5.52,activation or deactivation of one or
486.639,4.96,more internal switches to produce a
488.96,5.12,clearly defined output state
491.599,5.04,a key tenet of digital logic is that the
494.08,4.559,information is always clearly defined
496.639,3.361,measurable and their logic gates are
498.639,3.601,deterministic
500.0,3.68,quantum computing by contrast is
502.24,3.44,probabilistic
503.68,4.48,while qubits can be measured as two
505.68,4.799,discrete states like digital logic they
508.16,5.04,exist in a natural state known as a
510.479,5.12,coherent superposition where no clear
513.2,4.48,state can be inherently assigned to it
515.599,4.88,unlike digital logic the act of
517.68,5.039,measuring a qubit destroys its coherence
520.479,5.04,irrevocably collapsing its superposition
522.719,5.201,state to a classically digital one
525.519,4.081,a key difference in the value of this
527.92,4.08,measured quantum state when compared to
529.6,4.96,a classical digital bit is that it is
532.0,3.839,not deterministic but rather based on
534.56,2.719,probability
535.839,3.521,it is the manipulation of these
537.279,5.041,probabilities as they move between
539.36,4.8,qubits that form the basis for quantum
542.32,3.68,computing
544.16,4.239,qubits are physically represented by
546.0,5.519,quantum phenomena such as the spin up
548.399,5.12,spin down levels of an electron or the
551.519,4.721,vertical horizontal polarization of a
553.519,4.561,single photon and they operate entirely
556.24,3.44,by their natural quantum mechanical
558.08,4.08,interactions
559.68,5.04,how the probabilities of qubit states
562.16,6.16,are modified when interacted with comes
564.72,6.0,down to the quantum principle of phase
568.32,4.72,a cubit possesses an inherent phase
570.72,4.88,component and with this characteristic
573.04,4.799,of a wave a qubit's phase can interfere
575.6,4.48,either constructively or destructively
577.839,4.641,to modify its probability magnitudes
580.08,4.4,within an interaction
582.48,3.52,a classical analogy for the use of
584.48,3.359,interference to produce desired
586.0,3.68,information can be found in noise
587.839,3.361,cancelling headphones
589.68,3.2,these devices create an inverse
591.2,4.16,electrical signal from a microphone
592.88,4.8,sampling ambient sounds and mixes it
595.36,4.24,with the intended audio signal
597.68,4.32,the interference interaction of the two
599.6,4.479,signals results in a signal that mostly
602.0,4.16,cancels out ambient sounds as it
604.079,4.481,converts back into a pressure wave and
606.16,4.72,enters the ears
608.56,4.719,in effect a quantum program is a group
610.88,4.959,of qubits configured with probability
613.279,5.201,modifying elements in between to form a
615.839,5.281,large interference network this
618.48,4.56,networking concept when tuned should
621.12,4.0,resolve to a high probability of a
623.04,4.16,solution to the problem for which the
625.12,3.68,network was created for
627.2,3.92,it's important to note that the
628.8,4.88,mechanisms of these interactions are
631.12,4.56,never observable and are only defined by
633.68,3.68,mathematical models as attempting to
635.68,4.96,directly measure them would cause the
637.36,5.039,network to decohere into a single state
640.64,3.6,measurement can only occur at strategic
642.399,4.081,points in the network where the answer
644.24,4.08,lies within the collapsed state in
646.48,3.68,addition because of the probabilistic
648.32,4.0,nature of the process and its inherent
650.16,4.4,susceptibility to noise the final
652.32,4.24,measurement must be made at minimum
654.56,3.839,thousands of times in order to build a
656.56,4.64,statistical profile of the likely
658.399,4.961,outcome of the network
661.2,4.4,qubits possess no intuitive analog to
663.36,4.479,our classical world experience their
665.6,4.799,characteristics and behavior like much
667.839,4.24,of quantum mechanics are modeled using
670.399,3.601,complex numbers
672.079,3.841,however most of these properties can be
674.0,4.24,visually represented using a geometric
675.92,4.4,construct known as a block sphere a
678.24,4.08,block sphere visualizes a qubit's
680.32,3.44,magnitude and phase using a vector
682.32,4.0,within a sphere
683.76,4.639,in this representation the two classical
686.32,4.16,bit states are located at the top and
688.399,4.081,bottom poles where the probabilities
690.48,4.32,become certainty while the remaining
692.48,4.479,surface represents probabilistic quantum
694.8,4.159,states with the equator being a pure
696.959,4.32,qubit state where either classical bit
698.959,4.481,state is possible the phase component is
701.279,4.24,also represented by the hemispheres at
703.44,3.12,each side of the x-axis of the block
705.519,3.201,sphere
706.56,4.32,when a measurement is made on a qubit it
708.72,4.32,decoheres to one of the polar definitive
710.88,4.72,state levels based on its probability
713.04,4.799,magnitude collapsing any positions of
715.6,4.4,uncertainty in the process
717.839,4.161,much like how classical digital bits
720.0,4.32,have no computational value without
722.0,4.8,digital logic gates quantum computers
724.32,3.6,employ quantum logic gates on qubits to
726.8,2.88,operate
727.92,3.84,quantum gates are the fundamental blocks
729.68,4.399,of how information is manipulated within
731.76,4.72,a quantum circuit however unlike their
734.079,4.961,digital counterparts a quantum gate
736.48,5.2,modifies a qubit's probability magnitude
739.04,3.76,and its phase component not any direct
741.68,3.36,values
742.8,4.08,quantum gates are categorized by their
745.04,3.68,pattern of operation and the number of
746.88,3.92,qubits they operate on
748.72,3.359,among them polygates are the most
750.8,3.279,intuitive
752.079,5.44,polygates come in three variations
754.079,5.76,probably x y and z the x and y gate in
757.519,3.521,particular behave exactly like a digital
759.839,3.361,not gate
761.04,5.2,operating on a single qubit they invert
763.2,5.199,the value of a one or zero state
766.24,4.32,however on a bloch sphere their quantum
768.399,4.081,behavior is fully expressed
770.56,4.0,polygates rotate the vector that
772.48,4.72,represents a qubit's probability
774.56,5.44,magnitude and phase 180 degrees around
777.2,5.52,the respective x y and z axis of its
780.0,4.32,block sphere for the x and y gate this
782.72,4.16,effectively inverts the probability
784.32,4.88,magnitude of the qubit while the z gate
786.88,4.079,only inverts its phase component it's
789.2,3.92,important to note that phase changes
790.959,4.241,caused by polygate operations determine
793.12,3.92,how the qubit will interact with certain
795.2,3.92,types of other gates
797.04,3.599,some quantum gates have no classic
799.12,3.92,digital equivalent
800.639,4.721,the hadamard gate or h-gate is one of
803.04,5.76,the most important urinary quantum gates
805.36,5.68,and it exhibits this quantum uniqueness
808.8,4.479,a hadamard gate in effect can move a
811.04,3.599,binary state level in and out of
813.279,3.201,superposition
814.639,4.0,take a qubit at state level 1 for
816.48,4.56,example applying a hadamard gate to it
818.639,4.56,results in a superposition state if a
821.04,4.96,second hadamard gate is applied directly
823.199,5.041,after the superposition is returned back
826.0,4.88,to its previous state of one the
828.24,4.32,hadamard gate memory of the qubit's
830.88,3.759,previous state is derived from the
832.56,3.68,qubit's phase component
834.639,3.601,if a measurement is made between two
836.24,3.68,hadamard gates the collapsing of the
838.24,3.839,first hadamard superposition would
839.92,4.08,destroy this information making the
842.079,3.841,second hadamard gate effect only
844.0,2.959,applicable to the collapsed state of the
845.92,2.64,measurement
846.959,3.841,when visualized on the block sphere a
848.56,4.719,hadamard gate simply mirrors a qubit's
850.8,4.24,vector through a diagonal slice
853.279,3.521,through the bloch sphere that is defined
855.04,3.84,by z equals x
856.8,3.839,from this the function of superposition
858.88,3.12,reversibility through phase becomes
860.639,3.601,clearer
862.0,4.32,in addition to the pauli gates and the
864.24,4.64,hadamard gate two other fundamental
866.32,4.639,gates known as the s-gate and t-gates
868.88,4.8,are common to most quantum computing
870.959,4.88,models the s t gates are known as phase
873.68,4.48,gates as they only affect the phase
875.839,4.721,component of a qubit at 90 degrees and
878.16,4.56,45 degrees respectively
880.56,3.839,from these six fundamental urinary gates
882.72,3.52,composite gates can be created that
884.399,3.921,allow for both rotation or phase
886.24,5.52,shifting at arbitrary angles
888.32,6.879,these are called the rx ry and rz gate
891.76,5.439,for rotation and the r5 phase shift gate
895.199,5.44,it should be noted that both the rz and
897.199,5.76,r5 both rotate phase but rfi only
900.639,4.64,operates on the one state level region
902.959,4.32,of a qubit much like their digital
905.279,4.0,counterpart quantum computing requires
907.279,4.56,gates that operate on multiple bits in
909.279,4.321,order to accomplish useful computation
911.839,4.721,however in contrast to a classical
913.6,4.64,digital logic gate a multi-cubic quantum
916.56,2.88,operation is done completely without
918.24,4.24,measurement
919.44,4.88,this nuanced difference results in the
922.48,4.0,involved qubits losing their
924.32,4.24,distinctiveness in the operation
926.48,3.76,they become entangled
928.56,3.68,entanglement is a strange and unique
930.24,4.64,characteristic of quantum mechanics and
932.24,5.279,alongside superposition they form the
934.88,4.72,two key tenets of quantum computing when
937.519,4.081,two qubits become entangled they no
939.6,4.88,longer have individual independent
941.6,6.0,states they become two components of one
944.48,5.12,composite irreducible superposition and
947.6,2.96,one cannot be described without the
949.6,2.96,other
950.56,4.56,entanglement is accomplished using a
952.56,4.719,gate type known as a control gate
955.12,4.399,control gates trigger a correlation
957.279,4.641,change to a target qubit when a state
959.519,4.24,condition of the control qubit is met
961.92,4.24,these gates introduce conditional logic
963.759,4.401,into quantum computing but when combined
966.16,3.919,with the properties of entanglement the
968.16,3.52,true power of quantum computing becomes
970.079,3.2,apparent
971.68,3.92,the most important of these gates is
973.279,5.041,known as the control not gate or c
975.6,5.039,naught gate a c naught gate causes a
978.32,4.319,state flip of the target qubit much like
980.639,4.56,a digital not gate when the control
982.639,4.481,qubit is at a state level of 1.
985.199,4.161,in addition an entanglement is also
987.12,4.079,created between both qubits creating a
989.36,3.68,persistent correlation
991.199,4.08,the implication of this is that if both
993.04,4.88,qubits are measured the measurement will
995.279,4.401,always produce a correlated result
997.92,3.919,the properties of entanglement can be
999.68,4.64,easily observed when a hadamard gate is
1001.839,5.92,applied to a qubit and it is connected
1004.32,5.519,to a second qubit via a c-not gate
1007.759,4.481,because the control qubit is placed in a
1009.839,4.481,superposition by the hadamard gate the
1012.24,4.48,correlation created by entanglement
1014.32,5.6,through the c naught gate also places
1016.72,5.039,the target qubit into a superposition
1019.92,4.24,this is known as a bell state and it
1021.759,5.2,makes either single qubits state
1024.16,5.279,indeterminate when the control or target
1026.959,4.08,qubit state is collapsed by measurement
1029.439,3.6,the other qubit's state is always
1031.039,3.681,guaranteed to be correlated by the c
1033.039,4.0,naught operation
1034.72,4.319,if both qubits are measured both
1037.039,3.681,measurements will always collapse into a
1039.039,3.841,correlated result
1040.72,4.479,c naught gates are used to create other
1042.88,4.72,composite control gates such as the cc
1045.199,4.801,not gate or tafaligate which requires
1047.6,4.16,two control qubits at a one state to
1050.0,4.0,invert the target qubit
1051.76,3.12,the swap gate which swaps two qubit
1054.0,3.28,states
1054.88,5.039,and the cz gate which performs a phase
1057.28,5.2,flip similar to a r5 gate when the
1059.919,4.64,control qubit is at a one state
1062.48,4.16,while far more complex composite control
1064.559,4.401,gates can be created these are the
1066.64,4.159,simplest and most common
1068.96,4.16,the quantum entanglement at the core of
1070.799,4.321,these gates has a curious property that
1073.12,4.559,imparts tremendous computational power
1075.12,4.799,to quantum computing they transmit their
1077.679,3.761,correlations faster than the speed of
1079.919,3.921,light
1081.44,4.56,in fact the most recent experiments have
1083.84,4.8,placed a minimum speed for entanglement
1086.0,4.799,at around 3 trillion meters per second
1088.64,3.36,or about 10 million times faster than
1090.799,3.921,light
1092.0,5.2,in theory massive quantities of qubits
1094.72,4.72,can be entangled together and interacted
1097.2,4.16,with for the purposes of computation
1099.44,3.52,with no negligible increase in
1101.36,3.6,processing time
1102.96,4.88,when combined with the fact that a qubit
1104.96,5.04,is continuous by nature and has infinite
1107.84,4.4,states this quickly scales up to a
1110.0,4.96,magnitude of information processing that
1112.24,5.439,rapidly surpasses traditional computing
1114.96,5.28,for comparison using a modern computer
1117.679,5.36,even just coarsely simulating a 20 qubit
1120.24,4.16,operation can take up to 20 seconds with
1123.039,3.52,the compute time increasing
1124.4,3.04,exponentially with each additional qubit
1126.559,3.281,added
1127.44,6.16,on real qubits the same operation
1129.84,5.52,happens at the scale of nanoseconds
1133.6,3.84,in part 2 we'll look at the nature of
1135.36,3.84,designing quantum algorithms their
1137.44,4.239,application and the challenges
1139.2,4.479,associated with creating them we'll also
1141.679,4.0,explore the physical limitations of
1143.679,3.521,quantum computing and how its current
1145.679,5.321,state of development aligns with
1147.2,3.8,theoretical expectations
