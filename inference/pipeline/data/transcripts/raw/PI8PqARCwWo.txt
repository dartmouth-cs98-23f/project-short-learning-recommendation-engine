9.89,2.57,"- Hello everyone, my name's
Nathan Earnest-Noble."
12.46,2.3,"I'm a quantum computing
applications researcher"
14.76,1.16,at IBM Quantum.
15.92,1.87,"And today I'm gonna be
giving two lectures,"
17.79,1.85,"the first of which is this,"
19.64,2.74,the quantum hardware introduction.
22.38,3.09,"So in this talk, I really am
hoping to give you a sense"
25.47,2.9,"of some of the details
behind quantum hardware,"
28.37,3.117,"and how one can generally
design quantum hardware,"
31.487,1.203,and a few other things.
32.69,4.02,"So jumping into the details
of the overview of my talk,"
36.71,1.73,we're going to start off first by giving
38.44,2.157,a brief review of superconducting qubits
40.597,2.673,"and this idea of circuit
quantum electrodynamics,"
43.27,1.53,which is the paradigm that we use
44.8,2.46,to realize quantum computers at IBM.
47.26,3.38,I'm then going to discuss an overview
50.64,1.53,of some typical device errors
52.17,3.88,"and within a few of these,
highlight the details on them,"
56.05,3.12,"as well as some error mitigation
strategies that you can use"
59.17,2.81,"to sort of reduce the
impact that these will have"
61.98,2.89,"on whatever quantum circuit
you're trying to run."
64.87,1.8,"And then I'll finish
off discussing this idea"
66.67,2.31,"of quantum process
tomography, which is a way"
68.98,3.52,"in which you can sort of measure
the quality of your gates"
72.5,1.64,specifically trying to point out how
74.14,1.93,"this might be relevant
to some of the things"
76.07,3.07,"that we have for the
quantum lab coming up."
79.14,2.2,"I just wanted to say, trying to give"
81.34,4.39,"a quantum hardware introduction
in one hour is quite a feat."
85.73,3.24,"One that I don't really intend
to do in the utmost detail."
88.97,2.14,So really what I hope to do in this talk
91.11,3.577,"is give you a sense of the
forest of quantum hardware."
94.687,2.953,"And so you can sort of see
all the different varieties"
97.64,2.16,"of things that exist out there,"
99.8,2.43,"and then hopefully point
you in the right direction"
102.23,2.4,"for resources, if you care really dive in"
104.63,2.31,and understand the details of it more.
106.94,4.0,"So, to that end in our global
summer school from last year,"
110.94,3.7,"Zlatko Minev gave a
fantastic set of lectures"
114.64,3.73,consisting of six hours of material.
118.37,2.93,"And so much of what I'll
be talking was touched on"
121.3,1.44,in some of his lectures.
122.74,2.32,So I will try and point you to them
125.06,2.07,whenever it is appropriate.
127.13,1.48,"So with that said, let's go ahead"
128.61,1.88,and jump into this first thing
130.49,1.807,of reviewing superconducting qubits
132.297,1.75,and this idea of circuit computing.
135.04,3.97,So superconducting qubits are made
139.01,2.033,from superconducting circuits.
141.88,1.01,"Of these circuits,"
142.89,2.17,"there are sort of three
essential components"
145.06,1.84,that really we use to build up
146.9,1.45,a variety of different flavors
148.35,1.95,of superconducting qubits.
150.3,3.38,The first is just going to be a capacitor.
153.68,2.64,"So how the capacitor
ends up being realized"
156.32,2.1,"can be done in a variety
of different ways."
158.42,2.61,"Here on the figure, I've
shown one such realization"
161.03,1.62,where it's a coplanar capacitor.
162.65,1.57,"So you'd have two metal plates,"
164.22,2.21,that sort of exist next to each other.
166.43,2.25,And it's the dimensions of these plates
168.68,2.74,and the material that they're sitting on
171.42,1.89,that will ultimately dictate
173.31,2.35,what amount of capacitance they have.
175.66,0.92,"Then at the bottom here,"
176.58,3.75,"I have some mathematical
description of the Hamiltonian."
180.33,2.58,"So namely the number of
charge on these plates,"
182.91,2.85,"Q squared divided by two
times the capacitance"
185.76,2.26,will give you a sense of the Hamiltonian
188.02,2.38,or the energy of the system.
190.4,2.14,"Moving on to the next element
that we're going to want"
192.54,5.0,"in our superconducting qubits
is this idea of an inductor."
197.67,2.19,Inductors generally are realized
199.86,2.73,"through taking a meandering wire,"
202.59,3.12,"and it's the length of that
wire that largely dictates"
205.71,3.25,"the amount of inductance
that you will have,"
208.96,2.31,as well as the material properties of it.
211.27,2.13,"For its Hamiltonian description,"
213.4,1.84,"we have the inductance
on the bottom, again,"
215.24,2.38,"two times the inductance,
and at the top you have"
217.62,3.93,"the amount of flux going
through this inductor here."
221.55,2.81,"Now, the next essential component
is going to be this idea"
224.36,1.29,of a Josephson junction.
225.65,3.26,So Josephson junction is the only known
228.91,3.26,lossless nonlinear inductive element.
232.17,1.01,And there are many different ways
233.18,2.73,"in which you can actually
realize a Josephson junction."
235.91,3.25,"The popular one to use
for superconducting qubits"
239.16,2.56,"is going to be a
superconductor, insulator,"
241.72,1.62,superconductor barrier.
243.34,2.53,"and that sort of sandwich
of superconductor"
245.87,2.95,"with an insulator
between will be the thing"
248.82,2.87,"that actually creates the
Josephson junction for you."
251.69,3.15,"And here I have a picture
of one such realization,"
254.84,2.95,"where you have a superconducting
lead sort of coming here."
257.79,1.28,"And then on the bottom,"
259.07,1.44,you have another superconducting lead.
260.51,1.26,"And then in between these two,"
261.77,2.13,you have an aluminum oxide layer
263.9,4.72,"that separates those two
aluminum superconducting leads."
268.62,2.26,And it is this sort of stack here
270.88,1.25,that actually ends up giving you
272.13,2.813,"the desired Josephson junction
that you wish to have."
275.988,0.833,"And then at the bottom now,"
276.821,3.139,you can very clearly see this EJ.
279.96,3.88,"This is the Josephson energy
and this is actually related"
283.84,3.504,"to an idea of an inductance,
a non-linear inductance,"
287.344,1.716,"and in Zlatko's talks from last year,"
289.06,2.34,he actually points out how you can derive
291.4,2.85,"what the sort of linear
inductance of this is"
294.25,2.6,"and then go to higher orders
to see what higher orders"
296.85,1.48,of inductance you actually have
298.33,1.98,from some Josephson junction like this.
300.31,2.74,"And then importantly, the
nonlinear component as well as"
303.05,4.45,"is this cosine of phi, where
you actually have a phase,"
307.5,2.853,"the phi being a phase
across this junction here."
311.92,3.64,"Now, these are sort of the
three essential components"
315.56,2.44,"to actually realize
superconducting qubits."
318.0,1.21,And what we're going to do now
319.21,1.6,is begin to look at what happens
320.81,2.21,when you combine them in different ways.
323.02,2.46,"So to start, let's take
the two linear elements"
325.48,2.28,"namely the capacitor
and the inductor here,"
327.76,1.56,and combine those.
329.32,3.016,"So when we do that, we're
going to combine them,"
332.336,1.074,and this will actually give rise
333.41,2.817,"to a simple harmonic oscillator,"
336.227,2.203,one of the physicist's favorite sort
338.43,2.02,of toy problems to work with.
340.45,1.5,"At the bottom here, you can see"
341.95,2.139,"the Hamiltonian description of this,"
344.089,1.241,"where you have the charge and phase now,"
345.33,2.433,and it very natively comes together.
348.62,2.78,"And then here we have two
different realizations"
351.4,2.11,of a simple harmonic oscillator.
353.51,2.34,"On the left, we have
one that's sort of known"
355.85,1.92,as a lumped element resonator.
357.77,3.24,"So this now has say a
capacitance through this"
361.01,4.247,"sort of end type shaped
piece of metal here,"
365.257,1.673,and it has some capacitance to ground.
366.93,2.41,"And then at the bottom,
you have a meandering wire,"
369.34,1.75,which gives you the inductance.
371.09,2.45,"So this is called a
lumped element resonator,"
373.54,4.78,"because its resonant frequency
is such that if you take"
378.32,2.72,"the characteristic
wavelength of that frequency,"
381.04,3.46,"it is much larger than the
size of the device itself."
384.5,3.03,"Now this is important because
if the device is too large,"
387.53,3.58,"you can end up having resonant
modes of sort of arising"
391.11,2.74,from the physical nature of the device
393.85,2.71,"which would not be ideal
in the case of trying"
396.56,1.91,to make a lumped element resonator.
398.47,3.18,"However, you can actually
realize it through sort of a CPW,"
401.65,2.79,"coplanar waveguide resonator instead,"
404.44,3.47,"which is sort of shown here
highlighted in this red box."
407.91,1.62,So now it's basically the length
409.53,5.0,"of the Andarine coplanar waveguide,"
415.37,1.67,as well as its boundary conditions
417.04,3.01,"that end up giving rise
to the resonant frequency"
420.05,4.743,"for this style of a simple
harmonic oscillator."
425.85,3.28,"Now, this is where I wanna
point you to some lectures"
429.13,3.14,from last year on which in lecture 17
432.27,3.51,"Zlatko gets into how you can,
say, use Kirchhoff's laws"
435.78,2.2,"and what I sort of call
Newtonian mechanics"
437.98,4.51,"to analyze the the motion,
the equations of motion"
442.49,2.99,"for a simple harmonic
oscillator like this."
445.48,1.93,And he even gets into say Hamiltonian
447.41,3.6,"and Lagrangian mechanics,
which is a to sort of,"
451.01,1.16,"which is sort of shown here,"
452.17,1.88,"where you can see these
sort of stable points"
454.05,3.68,"within the phase space
of of such a device."
457.73,3.39,"In doing so he actually
starts to give rise"
461.12,2.103,or explanation to a few different things.
464.27,2.74,"And then in lecture 18,"
467.01,2.34,"he covers the quantum
mechanical version of this."
469.35,2.37,"So specifically he ends
up giving a definition"
471.72,1.65,of this sense of ladder operators.
473.37,2.54,"So you'll see in this
talk later on this sense"
475.91,4.09,"of As and A daggers, which
sort of are operators"
480.0,1.89,that help take you up and down
481.89,2.48,"some sort of ladder, if you will."
484.37,2.56,"And they're sort of known
as a second quantization."
486.93,2.88,And he goes into the details of
489.81,1.91,what these things actually are.
491.72,2.72,"And furthermore, he
shows how you can derive"
494.44,2.04,the sort of discrete quantum energies
496.48,1.08,for such an oscillator
497.56,2.38,"and how there's some
zero point fluctuations"
499.94,2.69,"so that even when you're at
the lowest possible energy"
502.63,2.26,"that you can have there are
some slight fluctuations"
504.89,1.3,that happen at this point.
508.06,3.61,"Now, just jumping to the
punchline of what Zlatko gets into"
511.67,1.86,"in some of his talk from last year,"
513.53,2.01,is you have the simple harmonic oscillator
515.54,2.46,"when you describe the energy levels of it,"
518.0,2.56,"what you end up getting is
that you have energy levels"
520.56,3.11,that are spaced out evenly by H bar omega.
523.67,3.16,"So zero, one is the same
frequency as one, two"
526.83,1.72,and so on and so forth.
528.55,5.0,So this is going to be a very useful tool
533.67,3.79,"as we'll see in a bit,
but one might be tempted"
537.46,2.31,"to try and make a qubit out of this,"
539.77,3.26,"except you'll end up running
into the issue that is,"
543.03,2.97,"if you try and drive on
your zero, one transition"
546.0,2.37,"of this oscillator, you're
inherently going to drive"
548.37,1.94,"on the one, two and the two, three"
550.31,2.23,and instead of getting coherent control
552.54,1.76,"of the zero and the one state,"
554.3,2.53,"you end up driving sort of
what's known as a Fox state,"
556.83,2.14,"where you actually just
end up getting photons"
558.97,2.4,that sort of populate this resonator.
561.37,3.27,"So this isn't necessarily
the end all, be all,"
564.64,2.07,"in the sense that now
what we're going to do"
566.71,4.78,"is we're actually going to
try and create a situation"
571.49,3.17,"where the higher energy levels
have a different spacing."
574.66,1.39,"We'll be doing this by taking,"
576.05,3.24,"as one might be able to guess,"
579.29,2.32,is taking this linear inductive element
581.61,3.68,"and replacing it with this
nonlinear Josephson junction."
585.29,4.22,"When you do that, you give
rise to what is sort of known"
589.51,1.863,as a charged base qubit.
592.39,3.4,"Here I'm saying a charged
base in a harmonic oscillator"
595.79,3.147,which is the way in which we realized
598.937,1.873,transmon qubits at IBM.
600.81,3.71,"So the energy for this, or the
Hamiltonian to describe this"
604.52,4.34,"is shown here where you have
some sort of capacitive energy"
608.86,3.35,"times n squared, where n is
now your up number operator,"
612.21,2.2,it's this A dagger A operator
615.3,2.86,times or minus this EJ of cosine
618.16,1.95,arising from the Josephson junction.
620.11,1.47,"This here could be derived, say"
621.58,5.0,"from doing some similar things
say in Kirchhoff's laws,"
626.79,2.71,"where you actually sort
of take into account"
629.5,3.81,the energy going across the loops here.
633.31,2.14,And Zlatko very nicely goes into some
635.45,1.63,of these details in his talk.
637.08,1.26,"The physical realization,"
638.34,2.34,"it comes in two different
flavors for this."
640.68,1.483,"One is, I showed here,"
642.163,3.547,"is sort of known as a 2D transmon qubit,"
645.71,1.89,in which your readout resonators
647.6,2.47,"are in this sort of coplanar
lumped element style"
650.07,1.3,that I showed you earlier.
652.496,1.654,"And then you can sort
of see the transmon here"
654.15,2.32,where you have two large capacitor pads
656.47,3.49,"and then in the middle here,
it's not too easy to see,"
659.96,2.743,"but there's a Josephson
junction connecting these two."
663.84,3.52,"Now, there is a different way
in which you can also realize"
667.36,2.66,"these sort of charged base qubits,"
670.02,2.1,and that's in this sort of 3D style.
672.12,3.96,"So namely instead of using
those coplanar resonators"
676.08,1.62,or the lumped element resonators
677.7,3.66,"to realize your simple harmonic
oscillator, what you'll do"
681.36,3.073,"is actually realize it
through a physical box."
684.433,2.707,"And so, it'll be the
dimensions of that box"
687.14,1.55,that actually end up giving rise
688.69,2.29,to your sort of resonant frequency.
690.98,1.61,"You use that as your readout resonator,"
692.59,3.23,"and then now you're going to
put some qubit inside here,"
695.82,0.9,as shown as this.
696.72,1.74,"So here you have two
blocks of capacitor pads,"
698.46,2.73,"and again, some Josephson
junction shunting them there."
701.19,2.62,"And then it's in this
way that you can get,"
703.81,3.28,make a 3D transmon qubit instead.
707.09,1.92,And here I'm sort of pointing to the paper
709.01,1.98,where they first realized this.
710.99,1.08,One thing that was really nice
712.07,3.32,"about these 3D transmons is
that they actually end up"
715.39,4.55,"putting a lot of the electric
fields inside some vacuum,"
719.94,3.14,"which ends up helping improve
the quality of your qubit"
723.08,1.55,at least when it first started.
726.341,1.219,And there's been a lot of improvements
727.56,3.07,"in that sort of 2D style, in
which we've actually ended"
730.63,2.71,"up doing quite well, and can
get very good quality qubits,"
733.34,2.863,"even in the 2D fashion, which
I'll discuss in a second."
737.133,2.707,"And as I mentioned, Zlatko, in lecture 19,"
739.84,4.01,"really gets into the details
of this transmon qubit,"
743.85,2.55,"how you can derive the
Josephson inductance,"
746.4,3.803,"and then really derive
that transmon Hamiltonian."
751.245,2.625,"And I wanna point out, you
don't necessarily have to have"
753.87,2.51,"just a single junction,
you can have two junctions."
756.38,3.79,"When you do this, what you
end up now doing is having"
760.17,1.79,a tunable SQUID loop right here.
761.96,2.3,SQUID loop in this case stands for
764.26,3.85,"superconducting quantum
interference device."
768.11,3.14,"And if you, again, shunt this SQUID loop"
771.25,2.39,"with some capacitor, you end up realizing"
773.64,2.4,a tunable charged based qubit
777.3,3.43,in the case where now your EJ is tunable
780.73,4.97,"by sort of piercing it with
some external magnetic field."
785.7,3.21,This here is an image of such a device.
788.91,1.8,"And also, what I just wanted to point out,"
790.71,3.58,is you can get quite elaborate
794.29,1.73,in how you design these devices.
796.02,1.82,"So you can see that the
capacity development"
797.84,2.08,for this is designed very differently
799.92,3.26,"than what you've seen in
some of the previous slides."
803.18,0.833,"But then right here,"
804.013,2.267,"you have one junction
and another junction."
806.28,2.96,And then this here is the loop that allows
809.24,3.82,"you to sort of begin to tune
the Josephs and energy there."
813.06,2.84,This is a very interesting device.
815.9,1.34,There is one downside.
817.24,2.79,"Once you have this sort of
external loop, or sorry,"
820.03,2.53,"when you have this loop,
and once you can pierce it"
822.56,3.83,"with an external magnetic field,
you become very susceptible"
826.39,3.74,to a larger set of noise sources.
830.13,2.33,"When I was in grad school,
and sort of working"
832.46,2.05,"to build these sorts of devices,"
834.51,3.18,"it's actually quite
impressive how sensitive"
837.69,3.04,"these things can be, in
the sense that I can take,"
840.73,3.02,"if we didn't shield our device properly,"
843.75,2.04,"we'd end up seeing that
when you walk in the room"
845.79,0.9,and you take your phone
846.69,2.68,"and you could wave your phone
around like 10 feet away,"
849.37,1.82,and you can actually see this cause
851.19,3.28,"the qubit frequency to
sort of shift around."
854.47,2.6,"Due to the magnets that are
sitting inside your phone."
857.07,2.67,"So this shows and says
that you'd have to take"
859.74,2.75,"a lot of care when
designing and considering"
862.49,1.89,what sorts of qubits you're gonna use.
864.38,2.27,"In the case of what we do at IBM,"
866.65,2.8,"we always stick with
fixed frequency transmons,"
869.45,3.44,"which helps improve the
underlying coherence of them."
872.89,1.59,I'll touch on this a bit later.
874.48,2.03,"When doing this, it
actually ends up changing"
876.51,3.82,"some of the native gates that
you can actually realize,"
880.33,1.833,particularly two qubit gates.
884.04,3.467,"So I've elaborated on this
Josephson junction a bit,"
887.507,2.956,"and how it ends up being
this nonlinear element."
891.555,2.255,"And that is an essential ingredient,"
893.81,3.667,"this nonlinear inductance
in order to realize qubits"
897.477,1.823,"but I just wanna point out
that you can actually begin"
899.3,1.93,to do some interesting engineering
901.23,1.83,of these junctions themselves.
903.06,2.4,"So namely, we have this
Josephson junction,"
905.46,1.71,which is very small here.
907.17,1.877,If instead we take this Josephson junction
909.047,2.043,"and we make it a bit larger,"
911.09,1.7,what you can actually end up realizing
912.79,2.1,is what is known as a super inductance.
914.89,3.79,"So namely take this
junction, make it larger"
918.68,4.249,"and then now have a chain of
large junctions like this."
922.929,1.741,"And now what you'll do is
you'll have effectively"
924.67,2.86,a linear inductance that is much larger
927.53,2.25,"than what you get for some equivalent,"
929.78,2.67,for some wire with an equivalent length.
932.45,2.14,"So the super inductance
ends up allowing you"
934.59,3.11,"to get sort of 10,000 times"
937.7,2.48,as much inductance compared to some wire.
940.18,2.35,Is a rough number here.
942.53,3.33,"Now, what's interesting about
this is you can take this,"
945.86,1.36,and actually ended up engineering
947.22,3.75,"a different sort of qubit
known as the fluxonium qubit,"
950.97,1.8,where you take the Josephson junction
952.77,3.76,"and shunt it by this
large inductance here."
956.53,4.2,"Here, I've pointed to one of the episodes"
960.73,1.99,"from our Qiskit seminar series,"
962.72,3.13,in which professor Vladimir Manchurian
965.85,2.54,"from University of
Maryland actually discusses"
968.39,2.45,"some of his work with
this fluxonium qubit."
970.84,1.29,"During his time in grad school,"
972.13,3.22,"he was the one to realize
the initial experiment,"
975.35,3.013,or have the initial experimental really.
984.66,2.19,"In his time in grad school,
he was one of the folks"
986.85,4.98,"who had initially realized
this qubit experimentally."
991.83,2.79,"And this is something
that I had the opportunity"
994.62,2.51,to work on a bit in grad school as well.
997.13,1.36,"And it's a very interesting device,"
998.49,1.883,for a lot of different reasons.
1001.82,2.45,"Now, here, I just wanna point out"
1004.27,3.99,"that you can end up taking
these four different elements,"
1008.26,3.54,"I've sort of added this fourth
one here of a super inductor,"
1011.8,2.35,and by doing so you can realize a variety
1014.15,2.91,of different qubits that sort of fit
1017.06,3.24,"this circuit style here, where
you have either a capacitor,"
1020.3,4.44,an inductor or a Josephson junction.
1024.74,3.04,"When you, depending on how
you combine these elements,"
1027.78,2.44,you are going to take the energy landscape
1030.22,2.41,that your quantum states actually exist in
1032.63,1.267,and you're going to adjust it.
1033.897,3.173,"And so when I, just a moment
ago spoke of this idea"
1037.07,4.27,"of using fluxoniums to generate
interesting properties,"
1041.34,1.7,one of those things is that you can create
1043.04,2.94,"an energy landscape that
allows you to create"
1046.954,3.056,"sort of quantum states that
are sort of robust to noise."
1050.01,3.22,"Now ,in the same spirit, you can,"
1053.23,2.26,"something that's started
to recently happen"
1055.49,1.66,which was quite exciting is you can take
1057.15,3.16,"this somewhat simple circuit style,"
1060.31,2.333,"in which you'd say have two nodes,"
1062.643,2.377,and you can make it a bit more complex.
1065.02,3.59,"Namely, you can get into
this idea of a zero pi qubit,"
1068.61,0.993,"in which now instead of two nodes,"
1069.603,2.227,you end up having four nodes.
1071.83,4.83,And this zero-pi qubit is designed
1076.66,3.67,"to be inherently robust
to all sorts of noise,"
1080.33,2.4,both for its T1 and its T2 properties
1082.73,1.54,"which I'll explain what those are,"
1084.27,2.75,just in case you don't know what it is.
1087.02,3.43,"In the same vein, for this zero-pi qubit,"
1090.45,1.61,"in our Qiskit seminar series,"
1092.06,3.183,"we had a graduate student from Princeton,"
1096.47,2.24,"who ends up speaking
about some of his work"
1098.71,2.32,for realizing this device.
1101.03,2.4,He also touches on some interesting things
1103.43,2.33,about fluxonium qubits.
1105.76,2.39,"Now, I've very quickly jumped"
1108.15,2.14,through all these different qubits
1110.29,3.1,that have sort of come into existence.
1113.39,2.76,"And I didn't necessarily
get into the details."
1116.15,2.92,"What I want to do, though,
is I really wanna point you"
1119.07,1.86,to some resources where you can find this.
1120.93,3.19,"So namely there's, I
made great use of this"
1124.12,3.23,"during my time in grad school,
but there's this GitHub repo"
1127.35,3.22,"for superconducting qubits
designed by Dens Holk"
1130.57,3.51,"who's one of the, he's a
professor at Northwestern,"
1134.08,2.72,"and he one of the pioneers of many of the,"
1136.8,2.45,"of much of the research in this area,"
1139.25,4.04,"as well as one of his
older post-docs, Peter."
1143.29,2.04,So they have this repo.
1145.33,3.3,"In this repo, you can go and
look at the different qubits,"
1148.63,2.41,"study what their environment looks like,"
1151.04,3.38,"the energy landscape that they exist in,"
1154.42,2.1,"and see some of the
interesting properties,"
1156.52,1.95,"you can say, and begin to understand"
1158.47,3.031,"how different energy
levels couple together,"
1161.501,1.639,"and some of the details
that I unfortunately"
1163.14,1.9,don't have the time to get into today.
1166.24,1.22,"With that said, though,"
1167.46,2.19,"what I wanna do is take a step back,"
1169.65,2.86,and look at the elements that we're using
1172.51,2.45,at IBM Quantum for our hardware.
1174.96,1.86,So specifically we are going to speak
1176.82,1.36,about the transmon qubit.
1178.18,3.25,"So it's a Josephson junction
shunted by a large capacitance"
1181.43,2.76,and then this simple harmonic oscillator.
1184.19,3.62,"So I want to now explain
this idea of circuit QED"
1187.81,3.67,"and how that's important
for readout and our devices."
1191.48,1.8,"Just for the sake of ease,"
1193.28,3.11,"I'm going to change
these Hamiltonians bit."
1196.39,1.62,In which before I was talking
1198.01,2.913,"with sort of operators of Q and phi,"
1201.84,2.63,"here instead, for the
simple harmonic oscillator,"
1204.47,2.13,I'm going to rewrite that in terms
1206.6,1.64,"of these A daggers and A's,"
1208.24,2.05,so these ladder operators.
1210.29,2.33,"If you're unfamiliar with what this is,"
1212.62,4.01,"please do go refer Zlatko's
talk from last year."
1216.63,2.38,"And then for my transmon qubit,"
1219.01,1.89,"for the sake of simplicity right now,"
1220.9,2.5,"I'm just gonna approximate
it as two level system."
1224.29,2.517,"It is important to know that
it's not a two level system,"
1226.807,2.923,"and this ends up coming
up in some of the details"
1229.73,2.29,"that I'll mention in the
next lecture actually"
1232.02,3.9,"when you start to think about
the control of your device."
1235.92,1.998,"And it will also be
important in this lecture"
1237.918,3.342,when you're thinking about rebalancing.
1241.26,1.55,So now what I'm going to do
1242.81,1.75,is couple these two devices together.
1244.56,2.41,"So here I've coupled it
in some capacitive manner"
1246.97,2.99,"where I have a capacitor
now that sort of allows"
1249.96,2.55,these two things to speak to each other.
1252.51,2.04,And it is this idea right here
1254.55,4.39,"that is the paradigm of circuit
quantum electrodynamics."
1258.94,1.93,So circuit quantum electrodynamic
1260.87,2.323,is the circuit equivalent of cavity QED.
1264.189,1.621,Cavity QED winning the Nobel Prize
1265.81,2.39,by Serge Haroche by Dave Wineland
1268.2,2.25,some number of years ago.
1270.45,1.88,"To describe this sort of system,"
1272.33,1.38,"you can describe it with this,"
1273.71,2.47,"what is known as a
Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian,"
1276.18,1.29,which is written here.
1277.47,2.59,"So just walking through
each one of these elements,"
1280.06,3.02,you have the the resonant frequency
1283.08,1.61,of your readout resonator.
1284.69,1.24,So that's omega-R.
1285.93,3.453,"So it's H bar omega-R ends up
getting the energy of that."
1290.27,4.64,"Then here you have omega-Q
times sigma Z for your qubit."
1294.91,3.0,"And then now you've had
these other terms of chi."
1297.91,4.51,"So this chi is dependence
on the coupling that arises"
1302.42,2.39,from this capacitive element here.
1304.81,2.19,And it is sort of proportional
1307.0,3.8,"in some sense to how strongly
coupled these two things are."
1310.8,1.83,What I want to point out that's important
1312.63,4.713,"about this element chi
is that your effective,"
1318.4,2.3,"once you've coupled
these systems together,"
1320.7,1.68,the effective resonant frequency
1322.38,3.58,"of your readout resonator
here is now actually going"
1325.96,4.31,"to depend on the state of
your qubits, this sigma Z."
1330.27,4.99,"So if your qubit's pointing
down or in the zero state,"
1335.26,3.19,"your readout resonator
will have one frequency."
1338.45,2.04,"And then if it's pointing
in the other direction,"
1340.49,1.2,"or in the one state,"
1341.69,2.52,"you'll end up shifting
what that frequency is."
1344.21,2.71,"So what that ends up looking
like in the physical sense"
1346.92,3.34,"is that you have some readout
resonator, as you see here,"
1350.26,4.99,"this is that CPW styled
resonator in which both,"
1357.26,2.77,"they're sort of open
boundary conditions here."
1360.03,2.94,"And then now you have
a qubit that sits here."
1362.97,3.0,"This happens to be a diagram
for a flux tuneable qubit,"
1365.97,4.7,"and it's capacitively coupled
to this transmission body."
1370.67,3.02,"Now, when you send it a tone,
if your qubit's in one state,"
1373.69,4.28,"you'll get, say, a lot
of signal going through"
1377.97,3.493,"but if your qubit ends up
being in the one state,"
1381.463,2.197,"what you'll end up finding is
that you actually don't get"
1383.66,1.56,much transmission through this.
1385.22,3.04,"It is through this that
you can then determine"
1388.26,3.37,"the the state of your
qubit with the sigma Z."
1391.63,4.41,"Putting this in sort of
form in which you can see"
1396.04,4.36,"the transmission, here, the
x-axis now is the frequency"
1400.4,2.07,"and then the y is the
amount of transmission"
1402.47,2.54,or the cavity population that you have.
1405.01,0.937,"So if your qubit's in one state,"
1405.947,3.613,"you'll see transmission
peak at one frequency"
1409.56,1.39,"and if your qubit's in another state,"
1410.95,2.44,"you'll see your transmission
peak in another."
1413.39,1.33,"It's in this way, now,"
1414.72,3.7,"if you say probe at this
frequency right here,"
1418.42,1.567,if you have very little transmission
1419.987,2.003,"and you know your
qubit's in the one state,"
1421.99,1.53,"and if you have a lot of transmission,"
1423.52,2.45,you know your qubit's in the two state.
1425.97,3.17,So this is the paradigm of circuit QED.
1429.14,1.8,"Earlier, I mentioned that we can't use"
1430.94,3.84,"this simple harmonic
oscillator as our qubit"
1434.78,2.38,"but as you can see, it still
ends up being very useful."
1437.16,1.99,"One, it's going to serve as the way"
1439.15,2.18,"that we actually readout
the state of our qubits"
1441.33,3.74,"but very importantly, what
this resonator does is"
1445.07,2.93,"it helps isolate the qubit
from the environment."
1448.0,2.65,"So it sort of does a
better job in ensuring"
1450.65,1.89,"that it doesn't interact
with the environment."
1452.54,2.03,And then this way you're gonna get
1454.57,1.687,better T1s and better T2s.
1457.488,3.252,"And overall, it's just
gonna allow you to be able"
1460.74,2.9,to do more with these quantum devices.
1463.64,5.0,"Within our systems at IBM, we
also use this linear resonator"
1469.03,2.74,as a way to couple two qubits together.
1471.77,1.69,And this will ultimately lead
1473.46,2.15,"to our cross resonance interaction,"
1475.61,3.17,"which I'll discuss in
depth in the next lecture,"
1478.78,2.57,"but I'll touch on it
in just a moment here."
1481.35,4.12,"Now, in terms of giving
a bit of an overview"
1485.47,2.48,"of different sorts of
superconducting qubits,"
1487.95,1.35,I want to take a moment
1489.3,3.03,"and rearrange this
Hamiltonian that we have here."
1492.33,3.17,"So it's the exact same
terms that were there,"
1495.5,2.87,"but instead what I've done
is I've kept my omega R,"
1498.37,1.68,and I sort of isolated it.
1500.05,4.93,"And instead now, look at the
impact on my qubit alone."
1504.98,3.13,"What you can see now, when
you read it in this way,"
1508.11,2.58,"is that what your qubit
frequency ends up being"
1511.93,3.97,"depends on the number of
photons inside your resonator."
1515.9,5.0,"So this is interesting because
you can actually now resolve"
1520.99,3.5,"individual photons that
exist inside this resonator."
1524.49,2.28,"So this was some of the
work done by Dave Schuster,"
1526.77,2.42,"who's a professor at the
University of Chicago,"
1529.19,2.1,and this is reference to his paper
1531.29,2.75,"in which now you can see
these numbers have all peaked."
1534.967,1.253,So the x-axis here is going
1536.22,3.26,"to say be the qubit frequency
that you're probing at."
1539.48,2.95,"And then this y-axis
gives you a sense as to"
1544.13,2.03,how much your your qubit actually
1546.16,2.54,is occupying this frequency in a sense.
1548.7,0.833,"Now, what you can see is"
1549.533,2.037,"if you have zero photons
inside the resonator,"
1551.57,3.24,you're gonna have one resonant frequency.
1554.81,1.91,"And if you have one it's shifts, two,"
1556.72,1.69,and so on and so forth.
1558.41,1.4,"Now, I bring this up,"
1559.81,5.0,"because if you're in this
number resolved state,"
1564.89,2.98,"or if you have a sort
of number resolved setup"
1567.87,5.0,"for your qubit, this will
actually be a useful in getting,"
1573.13,4.96,"making that linear
oscillator actually a qubit."
1578.09,2.56,What I mean to say is that there exists
1580.65,2.56,"this idea of SNAP gates they're called,"
1583.21,3.61,"so selective number dependent
arbitrary phase gates,"
1586.82,2.46,"by using this sort of gate here,"
1589.28,2.94,"you can actually end up
getting coherent control"
1592.22,2.1,of the photons inside this cavity.
1594.32,3.93,"So this on the right is
a transmon qubit coupled"
1598.25,5.0,to some sort of 3D like cavity.
1603.35,2.27,"The cavity in this case,
the frequency is set"
1605.62,2.493,"by the dimensions of
this pin at the bottom."
1608.97,3.18,"But by using this, you can actually now"
1612.15,4.54,"actually make that harmonic oscillator,"
1616.69,2.22,and have coherent control over it.
1618.91,1.51,So earlier I said you couldn't have
1620.42,2.13,"coherent control of the cavity,"
1622.55,2.52,that's true until you introduced this sort
1625.07,2.6,"of transmon element
that allows you to begin"
1627.67,1.62,to get control over this.
1629.29,3.52,"So these are sort of
the world of CAT codes,"
1632.81,1.383,or CAT qubits often.
1635.32,2.74,"Again, pointing to some resources in case"
1638.06,2.19,"you're interested to look into this more,"
1640.25,4.3,"we have several episodes
from our seminar series"
1644.55,2.95,in which we discuss this sort of approach
1647.5,1.393,to superconducting qubits.
1650.01,2.54,"Now, I touched on this
idea of measurements,"
1652.55,1.55,"and how you can discriminate, say,"
1654.1,1.96,"between your zero state
and your one state."
1656.06,1.12,And I just wanna put this into
1657.18,2.39,the language of Qiskit get a little bit.
1659.57,3.23,"So reviewing the way that
we measure our qubits"
1662.8,4.26,"is you are first going to drive
your qubit at its frequency."
1667.06,2.45,"And then you measure
the readout resonator,"
1669.51,1.7,or you measure the state of your qubit
1671.21,1.71,by probing the readout resonator
1672.92,1.96,in the way that I've discussed before.
1674.88,3.63,"So when operating at the
quantum circuit level,"
1678.51,2.76,this sort of comes back to as a result
1681.27,2.709,of the zero or one state.
1683.979,3.045,"And this now, and in the
context of Qiskit-Pulse,"
1687.024,2.4,"as it's sort of known,
is measured at level two."
1690.42,2.983,"This is not actually
what happens in the sense"
1693.403,3.507,"that in order to get whether
you have a zero or a one,"
1696.91,1.64,you have to do some analysis
1698.55,3.58,on the microwave tone that you send in.
1702.13,1.45,So specifically if you move down
1703.58,1.76,"to say measurement level one,"
1705.34,3.25,"what you can see is that
this here now is an IQ plot"
1708.59,2.85,"in which we're plotting the
real and imaginary components"
1711.44,2.18,of the microwave tone that you're sending
1713.62,1.83,into your readout resonator.
1715.45,1.61,"When you do that, you've end up getting"
1717.06,2.22,"sort of these two
different centroids here."
1719.28,1.47,"Where if you qubit's in the zero state,"
1720.75,1.54,you end up having a blob over here.
1722.29,1.06,"And if your qubit's in the one,"
1723.35,2.903,you end up having a centroid in this area.
1727.126,2.904,"And it's in this way that you
actually end up classifying"
1730.03,2.11,"whether your qubit's in
the zero or one state."
1732.14,3.02,"And you can, say, use
classical machine learning to,"
1735.16,2.77,"or a variety of techniques if you wish,"
1737.93,4.33,"to actually sort of create
a discriminator of sorts"
1742.26,2.39,"that classifies whether
you're qubit's zero"
1744.65,2.07,or classifies if it's one.
1746.72,3.09,"Now, this here is measurement level one"
1749.81,1.94,"in which we've taken this tone,"
1751.75,2.1,"it has some characteristic duration,"
1753.85,4.57,"and we've just taken the
time average of that tone."
1758.42,3.25,"Something that we hope
to make available one day"
1761.67,2.51,is this idea of measuring levels zero
1765.15,3.37,"where you can actually see
those time dynamics explicitly."
1768.52,5.0,"So this is the review,
sort of very quick review"
1773.54,2.12,"of superconducting qubits,"
1775.66,3.72,"and how it is that you realize
different sorts of elements."
1779.38,4.3,"With that, I now want to get
into some of the typical errors"
1783.68,2.57,that you will find in quantum hardware.
1786.25,4.48,"And for a few of those,
touch on how you can actually"
1790.73,2.93,mitigate the impact of those errors.
1793.66,2.063,So let's get into to that now.
1796.76,3.96,"So at a very high level, I've
listed four different sorts"
1800.72,1.95,of errors that you often run into.
1802.67,2.32,"One is this thing that
I've mentioned a few times,"
1804.99,2.39,mainly T1s and T2s.
1807.38,3.18,"There's going to be this
readout error, more generally,"
1810.56,2.72,"it's actually state preparation
and measurement error,"
1813.28,3.11,"spam error is what it's
often referred to as."
1816.39,1.22,"Then you could have, say, gate errors."
1817.61,2.05,So you're trying to control these qubits.
1820.78,4.51,"Your controls will have
imperfections associated with them."
1825.29,2.77,And that is something that is important
1828.06,3.53,"when trying to build a fault
tolerant quantum computer."
1831.59,2.11,And then this last one is I think
1833.7,2.21,"something that will be at
least somewhat more familiar"
1835.91,3.933,"to folks which is this
idea of shock error."
1839.843,2.237,"So basically getting a
good number of measurements"
1842.08,3.55,"to have strong statistics
of your system here."
1845.63,4.42,"Now, on the right I've listed
general mitigation strategies."
1850.05,1.79,"So Richardson extrapolation,"
1851.84,3.73,"I don't have a time to
talk about it today,"
1855.57,2.03,but this is the essence of trying
1857.6,2.55,to intentionally amplify errors
1860.15,4.95,"or amplify noise in your
system in a careful manner"
1865.1,1.94,such that you can actually use it as a way
1867.04,2.77,"to extrapolate back to sum zero,"
1869.81,3.36,some ideal zero noise result.
1873.17,1.66,"Readout errors,"
1874.83,2.41,"here, there are two different
ways that you can do it."
1877.24,2.077,So excited state promoted readout is one.
1879.317,2.593,And this essence of an A matrix.
1881.91,2.24,"For gate errors, really
just the engineering"
1884.15,2.5,"of the gates themselves is
the way in which you try"
1886.65,3.13,"and suppress any sort of
errors coming from this."
1889.78,1.73,"And this ends up getting
tied to the hardware"
1891.51,2.11,"in a certain way, which
I'll discuss about."
1893.62,4.58,"And then this last one, I
think it's maybe not explicitly"
1898.2,5.0,"an error mitigation strategy,
but it is in the same vein"
1903.55,2.21,which you can be clever about the way
1905.76,2.56,"in which you measure your system,"
1908.32,2.34,or measure the Hamiltonian of interest
1910.66,2.79,"that you're trying to study, for example,"
1913.45,3.0,to actually get better results
1916.45,3.33,"in this, the number of
shots that you have to take."
1919.78,1.89,"For the talk today, I'm going to focus"
1921.67,2.64,"on the ones that are
highlighted in purple."
1924.31,4.33,"So starting off, let's get
into this idea of T1 and T2,"
1928.64,1.3,in case you're unfamiliar.
1930.97,4.42,So T1 is just getting into this essence
1935.39,2.52,of you have discrete energy levels.
1937.91,3.45,"I'm going to take my
qubit from the zero state"
1941.36,1.21,and put it into the one.
1942.57,2.25,"And how long is it that I,"
1944.82,2.27,"so I take it, starts off
from the ground state."
1947.09,2.82,"I pump it to the excited
state in some fashion."
1949.91,2.74,"Then I wait and see how
long it takes to decay."
1952.65,2.9,It is this essence that gives you the T1.
1955.55,4.254,"The T2 is often referred
to as the coherence time."
1959.804,0.906,This is where you take your qubit
1960.71,1.32,that's in the ground state.
1962.03,3.212,"You say, can pulse it to the equator."
1965.242,2.988,"And how long is it before
you are no longer able"
1968.23,2.063,to read out that superposition state?
1971.15,1.83,"Now, how is it that we actually go"
1972.98,2.38,about measuring these two properties?
1975.36,3.52,"So for the T1, what you're
going to do is just,"
1978.88,1.1,"as I said a second ago,"
1979.98,1.75,you're gonna take your qubit and pump it
1981.73,3.29,"into the excited state, with
this idea of a pi pulse."
1985.02,2.247,"You wait some period of time
and then you measure it."
1987.267,3.693,"And then you do this experiment
for a variety of delays,"
1990.96,1.1,delta T here.
1992.06,2.5,"And then this is going
to have some exponential"
1994.56,1.84,decay curve associated with it.
1996.4,3.36,So you fit it to that exponential decay.
1999.76,3.08,"Then once you reach your one over X,"
2002.84,1.99,"one over E of that value,"
2004.83,2.95,"then that's going to be
your characteristic T1."
2007.78,2.15,"For your T2, you're gonna do this essence"
2009.93,2.53,"of a pi over two pulse where
you're gonna take your qubit"
2012.46,2.22,and put it to the equator.
2014.68,1.6,"You wait some period of time,"
2016.28,2.7,"and then you end up doing
another pi over two pulse"
2018.98,3.25,and read out the state of your qubit.
2022.23,1.58,"When you do this, you're
gonna end up having"
2023.81,1.52,these sorts of oscillations.
2025.33,3.187,"These oscillations here are
known as Ramsey oscillations."
2028.517,2.346,"And it is through these that you measure,"
2031.7,1.57,"in the way that I've drawn it here,"
2033.27,2.62,you're actually measuring your T2 star.
2035.89,3.973,"There's a variety of different
T2s, T2 star, T2 echo,"
2040.79,3.13,"but I'm not gonna get into
the details on that too much."
2043.92,1.85,"In the next lecture,
I'm going to talk about"
2045.77,4.12,"how you can actually get
this pi or pi over two pulse"
2049.89,1.007,"and how you can calibrate it,"
2050.897,2.413,and how you can do both rough calibrations
2053.31,2.63,as well as fine calibrations.
2055.94,1.18,"However, at this point in time,"
2057.12,4.68,"what I want to really get to
is these T1 and T2 properties,"
2061.8,5.0,"are inherently the thing that
limits us from being able"
2067.01,3.06,"to do interesting work
with quantum computers,"
2070.07,2.26,"or to have a fault
tolerant quantum computer."
2072.33,1.81,Those paired with those gate errors
2074.14,1.98,that I mentioned earlier.
2076.12,3.12,"So what is great about
superconducting qubits"
2079.24,1.77,is that we've had steady improvement
2081.01,2.83,"in both of these properties
throughout the years."
2083.84,1.7,"So from the initial realization,"
2085.54,2.35,"in which the coherence
times were very short,"
2087.89,3.74,"to now reaching values that are
much faster, or much larger."
2091.63,1.87,"And this, I just wanna
point out a few things."
2093.5,3.36,"So mainly there's this
idea of circuit QED."
2096.86,2.14,You can see that this was one thing
2099.0,2.66,"that sort of isolated the
qubit from the environment,"
2101.66,2.603,and consequently improved the T1 and T2s.
2105.36,2.64,"And then say, here you
have this transmon element,"
2108.0,2.89,which is taking what is known
2110.89,2.879,"as a Cooper pair box where you have,"
2113.769,3.511,"so a Cooper pair box is one
of the charge based qubits"
2117.28,2.16,"on which you have
Josephson junction shunted"
2119.44,1.68,"or with some capacitance,"
2121.12,1.95,"when you make that capacitance very large,"
2123.07,3.057,"you end up actually existing
in this transmon limit,"
2126.127,3.033,"and then you can see a variety
of other things as well."
2129.16,2.38,"I also wanna point out that,"
2131.54,3.76,"that paper was from back in 2013,"
2135.3,3.95,"just last year, this
review of the current state"
2139.25,2.95,"of superconducting qubits was published,"
2142.2,2.11,"in which you can see a
continued improvement"
2144.31,2.35,for these different sorts of devices.
2146.66,1.98,"Not only that, what I think is exciting"
2148.64,1.45,is that we really haven't reached
2150.09,3.59,a fundamental limit in our T1s and T2s.
2153.68,3.59,"So just a few weeks ago,
or maybe a month ago,"
2157.27,1.74,"at the time of this viewing,"
2159.01,2.93,"you can see that Jay posted
a very exciting announcement"
2161.94,1.98,"for our fixed frequency transmons,"
2163.92,1.75,in which we actually end up getting above
2165.67,1.4,a millisecond for our T1.
2167.07,1.92,And I think the T2 ended up being
2168.99,1.583,about a millisecond as well.
2171.49,3.103,"So now what's really leading
to all these improvements?"
2176.217,1.383,"I really liked this question here,"
2177.6,1.99,"what enabled this material,"
2179.59,2.283,filtering geometry or Vudu?
2182.93,1.78,All of the above.
2184.71,4.82,"So it really is exists
to improve these T1s,"
2189.53,2.41,there's a whole variety of factors
2191.94,2.34,"that I haven't even had
the chance to touch on"
2194.28,2.19,"coming from the design
of the qubit itself,"
2196.47,3.04,"the materials that you're
using to make that qubit,"
2199.51,3.23,"as well as a whole set
of control electronics"
2202.74,3.21,"or filtering that really
go down inside that fridge"
2205.95,1.75,that you may have seen in the past.
2208.66,1.9,"Now, a very important thing
that I wanna point out"
2210.56,5.0,"is that your T1s and T2s
are not inherently constant."
2215.89,2.8,"In the sense that they
will fluctuate over time."
2218.69,2.01,They're sensitive to a variety of factors.
2220.7,5.0,"So if you, say, don't
do a good job at keeping"
2225.91,1.64,the dilution refrigerator cold
2227.55,3.09,"that keeps these qubits
down at say 15 millikelvin"
2230.64,1.86,"and if that warms up, then you can start"
2232.5,2.3,to see fluctuations in your qubits here.
2234.8,2.57,"Or if your control electronics
start to have issues,"
2237.37,1.49,they can actually introduce noise
2238.86,2.33,into your qubits and cause fluctuations.
2241.19,2.4,"So these T1s and T2s
that are not something"
2243.59,2.92,"that are stable and this is
gonna be particularly important,"
2246.51,1.06,"say when you're trying to
do readout error mitigation"
2247.57,5.0,which I'm gonna touch on next.
2252.99,1.12,In the sense that you have to keep in mind
2254.11,3.08,that these things will fluctuate over time
2257.19,2.9,"and so this will introduce
fluctuations in whatever results"
2260.09,3.02,"you're trying to get in
your quantum hardware."
2263.11,2.44,"So getting into readout errors,"
2265.55,1.72,I'm going to first just give a sense
2267.27,2.32,as to what the readout errors are.
2269.59,2.94,"And I'm gonna touch on
this idea of an A matrix"
2272.53,1.72,and maybe I can briefly mention
2274.25,2.5,"what the excited state
promoted readout is."
2276.75,4.61,"So for readout errors, this is
basically saying that you are"
2281.36,3.0,"or how do you miss
classifications of the state"
2284.36,1.78,that you sort of expected.
2286.14,3.86,"In here, as I alluded to
earlier, there was this sense"
2290.0,2.47,"of state preparation
of measurement errors."
2292.47,4.03,"So you can, for a variety of
reasons say not do perfect"
2296.5,2.92,"at having your qubit be
in the zero state to start"
2299.42,2.373,"that's generally you
want it to start there."
2302.83,2.88,"This say can happen if
it is, I was just saying,"
2305.71,2.53,"if the temperature of your
fridge rises too much,"
2308.24,2.82,"you can actually cause your
qubit to be in the excited state"
2311.06,3.2,"just through thermal expectations
to the excited state."
2314.26,3.17,So in to see what that actually looks like
2317.43,1.65,"if you sort of squint your eyes,"
2319.08,1.87,you can see say that there's a blue dot
2320.95,2.59,"which is supposed to
correspond to the zero state"
2323.54,2.3,"but it actually ends up
being in this one cluster."
2325.84,2.643,"So this might be a state
preparation error here."
2329.48,2.31,The other side of this say is that
2331.79,3.54,"you have measurement
errors where I'm gonna get"
2335.33,4.92,"into one nature of measurement
errors in which now"
2340.25,3.47,"here I have say some
measurement pulse at the bottom."
2343.72,1.65,It's going to have some amplitude
2345.37,2.19,in some characteristic duration
2347.56,1.87,"but what you'll see is that,"
2349.43,3.2,"what I wanna start to do
is just mess around with,"
2352.63,1.71,keep the amplitude of this fixed
2354.34,2.733,"and change the duration
of by measurement pulse."
2357.91,2.37,"So if I make my measurement
pulse very short"
2361.31,2.71,"for this specific tuning that I,"
2364.02,2.64,"the calibration that I had
for the measurement pulse,"
2366.66,2.2,you can see that these two centroids begin
2368.86,1.56,to come close together.
2370.42,4.63,"So now this actually
will end up causing a lot"
2375.05,2.71,"of a large amount of errors
in your readout in the sense"
2377.76,2.31,that you are not able to well resolve
2380.07,2.36,"whether you're in your zero
state or your one state"
2382.43,2.493,because those two sort of centroids
2384.923,2.427,have come very close together.
2387.35,2.11,But you can see in the central one
2389.46,2.59,"that as I increased the
duration of my pulse"
2392.05,2.43,those centroids became well resolved.
2394.48,1.91,So you might have this impression that
2396.39,3.17,if I then say just continue to increase
2399.56,2.22,my pulse duration indefinitely
2402.713,2.307,then I'll end up getting perfect readout
2405.02,2.69,"but it's actually quite the
opposite in the sense that is,"
2407.71,3.12,"as you begin to increase
the duration of your pulse"
2410.83,1.54,what you can actually end up doing
2412.37,3.57,"is getting T1 decay
during your readout pulse."
2415.94,2.6,"So this is where your
qubit actually will start"
2418.54,2.18,in the one state during your measurement
2420.72,1.33,but because you took too long
2422.05,3.026,"for your measurement ends up
dictating to the zero state"
2425.076,2.784,"and then you end up
classifying it as such."
2427.86,1.87,So this is actually one way
2429.73,2.34,"in which that sense of
excited state promoted readout"
2432.07,3.15,"can be useful and that
you can take your qubit,"
2435.22,3.02,push it to the one of the excited states
2438.24,1.73,"and then in this sense,"
2439.97,3.74,"you somewhat extend the
lifetime of your qubit."
2443.71,3.19,"And I think discuss how
that actually works."
2446.9,1.98,"Now, another way that you can do this is"
2448.88,2.29,through the sense of an A matrix.
2451.17,1.95,"So for your A matrix here,"
2453.12,3.73,"what you are going to do
is you're going to create"
2456.85,2.89,or you're going to run a set of circuits.
2459.74,3.64,"So if you have any qubits and
you wanted the full matrix"
2463.38,2.26,you would run two to the end circuits
2465.64,1.79,"in which you are willing
to prepare the variety"
2467.43,2.93,"of combinations of these
different circuits."
2470.36,1.56,"So when doing so,"
2471.92,3.3,"if everything behaves
sort of in an ideal sense"
2475.22,2.68,"so you would prepare these
two to the end states"
2477.9,3.3,"which is two to the end
different quantum circuits,"
2481.2,3.65,"then you're going to
perform shocks on them"
2484.85,2.82,"and then from this, you construct
this sort of matrix here."
2487.67,3.22,"If it was behaving in the ideal
way that you'd want it to,"
2490.89,2.62,"you'd end up seeing that
it's a diagonal matrix"
2493.51,1.89,with zeros everywhere else.
2495.4,3.19,"However, because of
state preparation errors"
2498.59,1.21,"or measurement errors,"
2499.8,2.84,you'll see that you get non-zero elements
2502.64,2.86,in the off diagonal components.
2505.5,4.07,"Now, this is the way in which
you can begin to characterize"
2509.57,3.88,"that A matrix, you can
essentially invert this matrix"
2514.409,4.671,"and then from that, you
can improve any sorts"
2519.08,2.01,"of results that you're gonna
have on your quantum hardware."
2521.09,3.33,"So this is the essence of
readout error mitigation"
2524.42,2.81,"at least in the context of
what's built into Qiskit"
2527.23,2.94,"this complete merged house
that's called I believe."
2530.17,2.62,"Now, just to show you
how this ends up working"
2532.79,2.46,is you take your calibration matrix here.
2535.25,2.25,If you don't do any sort of correction
2537.5,1.84,you get these blue bars here
2539.34,3.43,"where what we're trying to do
is say, create the GAC state."
2542.77,3.916,"So it's 0, 0, 0, plus
1, 1, 1, but you can see"
2546.686,2.508,"that there exists a set of
errors here that keep it"
2549.194,5.0,"from being the ideal 50, 50
on your 0, 0, 0, plus 1, 1, 1."
2554.46,1.93,But once you apply the mitigated results
2556.39,3.64,"you can see that you ended
up greatly improving this."
2560.03,1.39,"Now, two things I wanna bring out."
2561.42,1.81,"One, you have to be aware of scaling here."
2563.23,3.01,"So, you have to run those
two to the end circuits."
2566.24,3.33,"So it's in this way that this
technique isn't necessarily"
2569.57,3.59,a scalable solution in the photonic sites.
2573.16,1.79,"So for example, if you tried to run this"
2574.95,3.93,"on our 65 qubit system,
you would have some issues"
2578.88,2.033,actually inverting that matrix there.
2582.045,2.735,"And then another important
thing to consider"
2584.78,3.58,is the fact that those T1 fluctuations
2588.36,1.5,that I mentioned earlier will lead
2589.86,2.21,to fluctuations in your A matrix here.
2592.07,2.55,"So this is something that's
important to consider."
2594.62,3.02,"So if you want sort of the
best results that you can get"
2597.64,3.75,"it can often be useful
to calibrate this matrix"
2601.39,1.68,on some regular occurrence
2603.07,3.175,"or near the time of the
execution of your shot"
2606.245,1.155,I think you're trying to run.
2607.4,2.92,"Now, this is just one readout
error mitigation technique."
2610.32,2.8,"There exists others like this
excited state promoted readout"
2613.12,2.58,"that I mentioned as well
as a variety of other ones"
2615.7,1.663,that you can try it and use.
2618.36,3.45,But now I want to move on to gate errors.
2621.81,3.1,So I'm not going to get into it too much
2624.91,3.53,"but what I wanna do is point
you to this resource here."
2628.44,1.85,This is again from that paper last year
2630.29,1.287,in which it's a review of sort of
2631.577,2.313,the state of superconducting qubits.
2633.89,3.13,"In this, they bring up a
variety of different qubits"
2637.02,4.32,"the initial years in which
that specific sort of"
2641.34,3.18,two qubit gate interaction was realized
2644.52,3.02,"as well as the highest
achieved fidelity for them."
2647.54,3.97,"So I am specifically pointing
out two qubits because"
2652.456,3.274,"or two qubit gates because
it's two qubit gates"
2655.73,3.25,"that end up being the largest
source of error most often."
2658.98,3.4,"And so, and it's in this
way that they're sort of one"
2662.38,4.66,"of the biggest limitations when
trying to run firm circuits."
2667.04,1.69,There are also single qubit gates
2668.73,2.07,"and how you characterize
those will be something"
2670.8,2.003,that we'll discuss in just a second.
2673.71,2.71,But something I want to point out
2676.42,3.69,"is that the style of your
hardware will influence"
2680.11,2.79,what sort of native gates you can realize.
2682.9,2.55,"So if you say you have tuneable transmons,"
2685.45,3.4,"you can end up realizing
say a CZ type gates,"
2688.85,5.0,"somewhat natively and in fixed
frequency transmon qubits"
2695.18,2.46,you have to do a little bit more work
2697.64,2.0,or instead say now you can have
2699.64,2.19,this tuneable coupling bus here
2701.83,3.43,"that allows you to realize a
different sort of iSWAP gate."
2705.26,2.25,So this really just goes to say that
2707.51,3.14,"the design of the hardware
is going to influence"
2710.65,2.7,"what sort of two qubit gates
that you have especially."
2714.3,3.74,"Now at IBM, we're using the
cross resonance interaction."
2718.04,1.44,"At a very high level,"
2719.48,1.777,"the way that this works
is you have two qubits"
2721.257,2.553,"and you're gonna drive
one qubit at the frequency"
2723.81,2.98,"of the other, and this will
lead to a two qubit gate."
2726.79,2.49,"In the next talk, I'll actually
get into the details of"
2729.28,2.39,how you use this interaction
2731.67,3.39,and how you can actually say build a C
2735.06,2.49,not V from such an interaction.
2737.55,2.77,"Now, these are just a variety"
2740.32,2.05,of different gates that you have.
2742.37,3.17,"What I want to highlight
is that they're going"
2745.54,1.94,to be imperfect in some way.
2747.48,2.37,"And so this means that you
have to actually measure them"
2749.85,2.73,"in some sense and measure
the quality of your gate."
2752.58,2.54,"I'll touch on two ways
in which we can do that."
2755.12,3.2,"One is this idea of
randomized benchmarking."
2758.32,2.18,So the essence of randomized benchmarking
2760.5,2.28,is that you are going to take gates
2762.78,1.76,that are from a Clifford group.
2764.54,1.65,"The reason that we're
using the Clifford group"
2766.19,2.16,is that it's actually easy to simulate
2769.66,2.14,and that'll be important in the sense that
2771.8,2.31,"what you'll do is you'll
apply a series of gates"
2774.11,1.78,that are coming from this Clifford group.
2775.89,1.34,"Because it's easy to simulate,"
2777.23,2.54,you'll sort of calculate its inverse
2779.77,2.16,and then apply the inverse such that
2781.93,2.12,you ultimately get the identity.
2784.05,2.09,So whatever state you have coming in
2786.14,2.67,"should be the state that
you have coming out."
2788.81,2.9,"Now, when you do this,
if you have perfect gates"
2791.71,2.77,"with perfect qubits,
you end up seeing say,"
2794.48,1.92,if you started off in the zero state
2796.4,2.97,"that you would always in this plot here,"
2799.37,3.42,"be sort of a boring, flat line up at one."
2802.79,2.51,"However, your qubits are
imperfect as well as your gates"
2805.3,3.03,"and then now you'll begin to
see that you became this way."
2808.33,2.88,"And now, there can be a variety of ways"
2811.21,1.35,in which you actually end up doing
2812.56,2.03,this randomized benchmarking.
2814.59,2.64,We have some resources that discuss
2817.23,2.19,some different methods that exist
2819.42,1.54,for randomized benchmarking.
2820.96,1.64,"Here, just pointing out,"
2822.6,2.27,"there can be leakage
randomized benchmarking"
2824.87,1.77,which is a way to actually describe
2826.64,1.69,how much you've leaked outside
2828.33,2.98,"of your zero one state
into higher energy states."
2831.31,2.24,So if you try to make very fast pulses
2833.55,2.06,this can be quite important.
2835.61,2.55,If you wanted to characterize the quality
2838.16,2.33,"of a specific gate,
you can do this essence"
2840.49,2.22,of interleaved randomized benchmarking
2842.71,1.66,"where in between each one of these,"
2844.37,2.86,"you're going to interleave
the target date of interest."
2847.23,3.38,And there's many others that in this space
2850.61,1.62,of randomized benchmarking.
2852.23,2.58,"And a recent thing I've
seen being developed"
2854.81,2.14,is this essence of cycle benchmarking
2856.95,1.75,"where instead of taking
from the Clifford group"
2858.7,1.77,you take from the Pauli group.
2860.47,5.0,"Now, this is a useful
way to characterize gates"
2865.59,4.223,"particularly as it is
robust to those spam error"
2869.813,1.12,that I mentioned.
2871.88,2.43,"But, I still want to
point out a different way"
2874.31,1.54,in which you can measure gates
2875.85,4.03,"which comes down to this idea
of quantum process tomography."
2879.88,2.59,"So quantum process tomography
and quantum state tomography"
2882.47,2.11,ended up being equivalent in some sense.
2884.58,1.89,What that basically is saying
2886.47,3.85,"is that I have some unitary
that I wish to enact"
2890.32,5.0,"on my qubit or my system, but
I want to actually test what,"
2897.66,3.61,"so I have the ideal of unitary
that I wish to implement"
2901.27,1.61,but I wanna test what unitary
2902.88,2.24,I actually end up implementing.
2905.12,3.35,"To do this, you do quantum
process tomography."
2908.47,2.18,"The essence of this is
that you are going to have"
2910.65,2.873,a set of state preparations that you do
2913.523,1.867,and you going to have
2915.39,3.4,"some measurements
preparations that you do."
2918.79,1.33,So you always end up measuring
2920.12,2.48,and sort of your Z basis for your qubits
2922.6,2.71,"but then there's ways
that you can sort of map"
2925.31,2.45,this to your X spaces or your Y basis.
2927.76,2.18,"So for a Y qubit example, saying"
2929.94,2.65,"you are going to prepare these
four different states here"
2932.59,1.827,"so your zero state, your one state,"
2934.417,2.483,and then the sort of plus and minus states
2936.9,1.84,on the equator of your block sphere
2938.74,2.09,"and then you measure into
three different basics"
2940.83,0.833,"of X, Y, and Z."
2943.103,1.707,"For a one qubit instance,"
2944.81,3.284,this is going to require 12 circuits.
2948.094,2.296,"When you go to two qubits, you
actually end up scaling up to"
2950.39,2.23,a larger number of circuits.
2952.62,2.257,"This will be an exercise
in the lab notebook"
2954.877,3.433,"to determine precisely
how many you actually"
2958.31,1.19,are going to do.
2959.5,1.55,"But so, once you've done this,"
2961.05,2.96,you can reconstruct the unitary
2964.01,3.38,"that you've sort of implemented
on your quantum hardware"
2967.39,3.81,"and something that we
also will point out in lab"
2971.2,2.81,"is that this sort of
quantum process tomography"
2974.01,2.38,is very sensitive to those spanners.
2976.39,3.33,"So when doing QPT, you definitely benefit"
2979.72,2.52,from using readout error mitigation
2982.24,3.26,"but once you've constructed this unitary,"
2985.5,1.91,you can then get in the essence
2987.41,2.65,"of what sort of quality
gates you're having."
2990.06,2.08,"Mainly it's through this
idea of the fidelity"
2992.14,3.17,"and what you're going to take,
sort of the dagger version"
2995.31,2.69,of the ideal unitary that you wish to have
2998.0,2.51,"and multiply it by the one
that you actually measured"
3000.51,2.17,from your quantum process tomography.
3002.68,2.32,"Then you're going to take
the trace of the product"
3005.0,4.06,"of those two, and then normalized
by the dimensions here."
3009.06,2.3,So this ends up giving you a value of one
3011.36,1.703,if you've done a perfect gate.
3015.3,2.51,"Here, I point again to some resources"
3017.81,2.22,where you can actually look at tutorials
3020.03,3.09,that exist for tomography of all sorts
3023.12,1.86,as well as some papers.
3024.98,2.13,"So, say this is the Qiskit pulse paper"
3027.11,2.65,"where you can actually use,
say, quantum process tomography"
3029.76,2.18,to measure the coupling of strength
3031.94,1.86,between two different qubits say.
3033.8,3.0,And then this paper here is talking about
3036.8,3.29,"some of the details of a
quantum process tomography"
3040.09,2.84,and how you can actually use it to measure
3042.93,1.573,the state of your qubit.
3045.73,5.0,So this is the conclusion of this lecture.
3051.38,1.22,"Just as a quick recap,"
3052.6,3.29,"we reviewed different
superconducting qubit architectures"
3055.89,4.27,"going from transmon qubits
to tunable transmons"
3060.16,2.43,to fluxoniums to zero pies
3062.59,4.22,"or these sorts of bosonically
encoded CAP qubits."
3066.81,2.64,We've discussed this idea of circuit QED
3069.45,3.22,"and how you can do a qubit
readout within this space."
3072.67,2.76,"And then we've touched
on a few different errors"
3075.43,3.1,that we have and how you can mitigate them
3078.53,1.52,as well as the fact that these errors
3080.05,2.75,"are inherently something that
will fluctuate over time."
3083.96,1.54,I hope that you enjoyed this lecture.
3085.5,2.24,"Please do feel free to reach
out with any questions."
3087.74,1.96,I believe there will be some sort of chat
3089.7,2.65,"and I'll definitely be
active within there."
3092.35,0.97,Thank you very much.
3093.32,3.247,"I look forward to
talking to you more soon."
