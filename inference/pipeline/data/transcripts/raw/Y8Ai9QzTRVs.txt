9.46,3.62,"It is also very important to acquire
the results of our computation,"
13.08,3.12,by means of the qubit measurements.
16.2,5.44,"We should not forget that measuring the qubit
state will actually destroy the superposition."
21.64,3.76,"As we explained before,
the amplitude of the states of the qubit"
25.4,5.96,"represents the probability with which
a particular state of the qubit will be measured."
31.36,4.179,"This again shows the non-deterministic
way of quantum computing."
35.539,5.041,"Even though the largest amplitude implies
the highest probability for being read,"
40.58,3.999,"it will happen that several runs
of the same algorithms are needed."
44.58,4.08,"And each time at the end of the algorithm,
the measurement can be done"
48.66,3.04,"and when done multiple times, the result,"
51.7,3.84,"which has been read out,
most of the times contains the result."
56.74,5.6,"For doing a measurement, we need to measure
the qubit and convert the analog signal"
62.34,5.98,"we receive back from the qubit using 
an Analog-to-Digital converter this time."
68.33,5.79,"And then we apply a digital signal processing
algorithm to discriminate the outcome of measurement"
74.12,2.57,â€“ whether it is a 0 or a 1.
76.69,4.49,"The measurement outcome can be 
a final result or an intermediate result,"
81.18,3.32,which can be used to control further operations.
86.26,6.52,"Closely related to this measurement operation
is quantum error correction and detection."
92.79,4.43,"We need to keep in mind that 
qubits are fragile and error-prone"
97.22,4.9,"and due to their very limited coherence time,
they are exposed to errors."
102.12,6.2,"Therefore, quantum error correction is 
a critical component of the micro-architecture;"
108.32,6.26,"and a dedicated unit is in charge of
triggering periodic error-correction cycles"
114.58,3.28,and correcting errors whenever they happen.
117.86,5.1,"Such that they offer the required 
fault-tolerance and provide correct results."
123.6,3.2,"Once the measurements of
the ancilla qubits are received,"
126.8,5.02,"a decoder will interpret
the readouts and determine whether or not"
131.82,5.64,"an error has manifested itself for
which some correction is necessary."
137.46,5.48,"Quantum Error Correction is a very important
functionality of the micro-architecture"
142.94,4.98,"as certain estimates show that up to 90%
of what a quantum processor is doing"
147.92,4.9,"is actually related to that
Quantum Error Correction activity."
153.84,3.86,Another important component of the micro-architecture
157.7,2.38,"is the qubit addressing table,"
160.08,4.42,"which allows us to keep track
of qubits and their locations."
164.5,5.84,"The address and location of these qubits are
basically used to update the physical address"
170.34,6.64,"of each qubit used in our algorithm, 
whenever it is moved from one location to the other."
177.32,4.84,"This addressing table is crucial for 
accommodating the routing mechanisms,"
182.16,5.36,"which move qubits around
to enable two-qubit operations"
187.52,4.44,"which require the qubits nearest
neighbour to be as close as possible."
193.36,6.46,"Finally when operating all these units together,
we can execute quantum algorithms"
199.82,6.14,"and enjoy the opportunities that quantum computing
has to offer in terms of computing speed-up."
