2.95,3.02,"In this day and age, we
have a lot of secrets."
5.97,2.73,"And we're constantly having to
give them away to the internet."
8.7,2.55,"Like, Amazon has my
credit card number."
11.25,2.0,I typed it in voluntarily.
13.25,2.46,"So I could order a BSG
pendant and some ferrofluid."
15.71,3.04,"But I don't even know where
my information is kept."
18.75,2.38,"How can I trust that
Amazon doesn't accidentally"
21.13,0.88,give it away?
22.01,2.86,"This challenge of secret
keeping is an important problem"
24.87,1.61,for companies and governments.
26.48,2.74,"That's why encryption, or
translating information"
29.22,3.06,"into a code only the
right people can read, is"
32.28,3.58,"so important-- so important that
it was put on the United States"
35.86,3.19,"Munitions List, along with
flamethrowers and bombs,"
39.05,2.77,"as a weapon regulated
for national security."
41.82,2.124,"That was until a student
took the United States"
43.944,1.416,"government to court
and encryption"
45.36,1.59,was ruled free speech.
46.95,3.22,"Now most of the focus is
on improving encryption,"
50.17,2.3,"because as computers
get smarter and faster,"
52.47,3.13,"these codes become
easier to unscramble."
55.6,2.33,"That's why we need to turn
to cutting-edge physics"
57.93,1.76,to improve encryption.
59.69,1.12,But let's find out how.
60.81,2.71,"This episode of ""Physics Girl""
is supported by Squarespace."
63.52,1.95,"Share your passion
with the world."
65.47,3.28,"Before I go physics on you,
let's talk about codes."
68.75,1.68,"A super simple type
of code but one"
70.43,3.26,"that was used by the Spartan
army and probably Scooby-Doo"
73.69,2.2,"is simple substitution,
where you just"
75.89,1.63,"swap out each letter
in the alphabet"
77.52,1.54,"for a different letter, like so."
79.06,2.36,"For example,
DIANNAROCKS would become"
81.42,3.19,"EJBOOBSPDLT. This code
is easy to generate"
84.61,1.81,and almost as easy to crack.
86.42,1.717,"You could even use
extra information,"
88.137,1.583,"like guessing that
the six-letter word"
89.72,2.13,"with the double O's
was my name, helping"
91.85,1.4,you to crack the code faster.
93.25,3.6,"So cryptographers turned to
math to develop harder codes."
96.85,2.12,"They thought a good code
should be easy to create"
98.97,2.53,"but difficult to
decode, like a mess."
101.5,1.89,"In math terms, they
sought processes"
103.39,2.18,"called one-way functions--
easy to compute"
105.57,4.43,"one way but hard in reverse,
like multiplying prime numbers."
110.0,2.91,"If I told you to
multiply 79 by 73,"
112.91,3.72,"a few punches on your
calculator would give you 5767."
116.63,2.425,"But if I told you
to factor 5767,"
119.055,1.5,"well, you'd have
to start by saying,"
120.555,2.205,"does that I divide
by 2 and then 3"
122.76,2.41,"and then 5 up through
the prime numbers"
125.17,2.7,"until you finally
found 79 times 73."
127.87,1.44,"That would take
some key punching."
129.31,1.85,"The largest prime
number known today"
131.16,5.32,"is 2 to the 74,207,281
minus 1, a number"
136.48,2.3,"that I couldn't even write
on the screen if I wanted,"
138.78,3.6,"because that's more digits
than pixels in my HD video."
142.38,2.85,"Now, imagine multiplying that
by the second largest known"
145.23,2.34,"prime number and giving
that to your little cousin"
147.57,1.78,to factor on a rainy day.
149.35,1.11,That's just cruel.
150.46,1.88,But it's great for encryption.
152.34,2.06,"Imagine I want to send
the message DIANNA"
154.4,2.49,"ROCKS to another
secret agent, Sophia."
156.89,1.58,I'm going to use this math.
158.47,2.95,"First, I substitute the
letters in my message for bits,"
161.42,2.11,"like we did in our
easy Scooby-Doo code."
163.53,3.23,"If we were using binary, DIANNA
ROCKS would look like this."
166.76,4.37,"But we'll just use 1, 2, 3,
4, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10."
171.13,2.35,"The 5 is for the space,
and the conversion key"
173.48,2.73,"from numbers back to
letters is publicly known."
176.21,1.17,No surprises yet.
177.38,3.42,"But then, I multiply each of the
numbers by two prime numbers--"
180.8,4.65,"say, 11 and 13-- for a total
multiplication factor of 143."
185.45,4.39,"DIANNA ROCKS becomes 143,
286, 429, and so forth."
189.84,2.52,"I've told Sofia ahead
of time that the key is"
192.36,3.13,"to divide by 143 and she
can decode the message."
195.49,2.75,"Now, say someone intercepts
the encrypted message."
198.24,1.71,"They have to figure
out what to divide by"
199.95,1.75,to decode the message.
201.7,2.24,"This example wouldn't
be so difficult."
203.94,1.7,"But what if we used
prime numbers that"
205.64,1.76,are thousands of digits long?
207.4,1.84,"An eavesdropper might
be crunching numbers"
209.24,1.97,for longer than they are alive.
211.21,3.58,"This is the idea behind using
prime numbers for encryption,"
214.79,2.98,"though real-life techniques
like the RSA algorithm"
217.77,1.41,are a bit more complicated.
219.18,2.11,"Now, the limitation
with using prime numbers"
221.29,2.62,"is that we keep building
smarter and faster computers"
223.91,2.21,"that factor out
ever more quickly."
226.12,2.7,"Experts warn that with new
technologies like quantum"
228.82,3.65,"computing, codes that currently
take hundreds of years to crack"
232.47,1.87,could be solved within minutes.
234.34,2.41,"And this is where
the physics comes in."
236.75,2.8,"Enter quantum
cryptography, a technology"
239.55,2.05,"that hides
information in photons"
241.6,1.83,or the particles of light.
243.43,1.21,Here's how it works.
244.64,3.08,"Say you want to enlighten--
heh, heh-- a chosen stranger"
247.72,2.25,"on our mantra, or this."
249.97,3.69,"Instead of deciding upfront
what the secret multiplication"
253.66,3.369,"factor or key is, you
use quantum mechanics"
257.029,3.331,"to make one randomly and
send it to your recipients."
260.36,2.52,"Here's how the
random key is made."
262.88,2.72,"Alice, the message
sender, sends photons"
265.6,3.52,"that are polarized or vibrating
in four different directions--"
269.12,3.21,"horizontal, vertical,
diagonal, left, or right."
272.33,2.59,"Bob, the recipient,
measures which direction"
274.92,0.87,they're polarized.
275.79,3.53,"Note by using two differently
polarized detectors"
279.32,3.36,"for each photon one at a
time back and forth guessing"
282.68,3.42,"which detector to use randomly,
the detectors translate"
286.1,1.42,the photons into bits.
287.52,1.54,"Like, a horizontal
measurement could"
289.06,3.64,"register as a 1 and a vertical
as a 0 on this detector."
292.7,2.89,"And eventually, Bob will
get the multiplication key"
295.59,1.65,from this set of bits.
297.24,2.86,"So now, Bob has a
measurement of 1, 0, 0, 1,"
300.1,2.36,"et cetera, for each
photon, keeping in mind"
302.46,3.46,"that he measured them on two
different detectors randomly."
305.92,1.63,Now he compares with Alice.
307.55,3.71,"And for each photon, he'll tell
her which detector he used."
311.26,2.87,"And she'll tell him,
wrong, right, wrong, right,"
314.13,3.75,"based on which filter she
used to send the photons."
317.88,3.64,"Because, see, Alice sent either
vertical horizontal photons"
321.52,1.72,or diagonal photons.
323.24,2.22,"And if Bob uses a
diagonal detector"
325.46,1.93,"on a horizontal or
vertical photon,"
327.39,1.92,"according to quantum
mechanics, he"
329.31,2.02,"will have a 50%
chance of measuring"
331.33,2.2,a 0 and 50% chance of a 1.
333.53,4.326,"That's why Bob's detectors
need to match Alice's filters."
337.856,1.624,"After they go through
this public check"
339.48,2.0,"of the order the
detectors were used,"
341.48,3.61,"they throw out each result from
when Bob guessed incorrectly."
345.09,2.42,"And now they have a sequence
of identically polarized"
347.51,1.67,and measured photons.
349.18,1.82,That sequence is the key.
351.0,2.75,"Alice can now send the
actual encrypted message"
353.75,2.76,"through a traditional channel
and use the quantum key"
356.51,1.01,to decrypt it.
357.52,1.86,"And mathematicians
have proven that if you"
359.38,2.5,"make a truly random
numerical key,"
361.88,2.96,"you can theoretically make a
code called a one-time pad that"
364.84,1.49,is unbreakable.
366.33,3.73,"So why can the order of
polarized detectors used by Bob"
370.06,1.32,be public?
371.38,1.59,"Well, it's not
the ones and zeros"
372.97,2.01,"that he obtains that
are being shared."
374.98,2.16,"It's just the
order of detectors."
377.14,2.55,"You would still need to
send the polarized photons"
379.69,1.98,"in through those detectors
in the correct order"
381.67,1.32,to figure out the key.
382.99,2.85,"But those photons were
polarized randomly,"
385.84,1.87,"so the eavesdropper
is outta luck."
387.71,3.31,"And things on this scale--
1,000th of the width of a human"
391.02,3.72,"hair-- get weird, as they say,
because of quantum mechanics."
394.74,1.9,"If an eavesdropper
hacks into the system"
396.64,1.99,"and tries to copy some
of the photons using"
398.63,3.23,"the wrong order of detectors,
they'll change the key."
401.86,1.93,"Bob and Alice will
know, because they"
403.79,3.14,"can check for errors in a
subset of the bits in the key,"
406.93,1.53,and they can try again.
408.46,1.78,"Of course, getting
quantum cryptography"
410.24,2.72,"to work in the real
world is not so easy."
412.96,3.09,"Small disturbances can
change photon polarization."
416.05,2.08,"And when creating photons,
if you get them off"
418.13,2.9,"by even just a degree,
those errors will add up."
421.03,2.35,"Physicists have only been
able to send quantum keys"
423.38,1.76,over 200 kilometers.
425.14,2.2,"You can even sabotage
quantum detectors"
427.34,2.12,"by shining a bright
light on them."
429.46,2.68,"And even if quantum encryption
does become commercially"
432.14,2.78,"viable, much of the
internet's infrastructure"
434.92,1.4,would have to be rebuilt.
436.32,3.36,"But still, think of how powerful
this technology would be."
439.68,2.68,"An eavesdropper has to measure
in order to get the key."
442.36,2.037,"But when measured,
the key changes."
444.397,2.083,"You can know if you've
been hacked even before you"
446.48,3.4,"send the message because of this
fundamental aspect of nature."
449.88,2.68,"The universe is based
on probabilities."
452.56,1.97,"Quantum cryptography
hides information"
454.53,2.93,"not by besting a computer
but by stowing it"
457.46,3.13,"within the unknowability
of nature itself."
