0.149,3.641,"Hello everyone. So far in the series on
data structures,"
3.79,4.04,"we have talked about some of the linear
data structures like array,"
7.83,5.939,"linked list, stack and queue. In all these
structure, data is arranged in a linear or"
13.769,3.631,"sequential manner, so we can call
them linear data structures"
17.4,4.84,"and we've also talked about tree which
is a non-linear data structure."
22.24,5.539,"Tree is a hierarchical structure. Now as
we understand data structures are ways to"
27.779,1.871,"store and organize data,"
29.65,3.94,"and for different kinds of data we use
different kinds of data structures."
33.59,4.34,"In this lesson, we're going to introduce
you to another non linear data"
37.93,0.51,structure
38.44,4.41,"that has got its application in a wide
number of scenarios in computer science."
42.85,3.93,"It is used to model and represent a
variety of systems"
46.78,3.04,and this data structure is graph.
49.82,3.8,"When we study data structures, we often
first study them as"
53.62,3.45,"mathematical or logical models. Here
also,"
57.07,3.7,"we will first study graph as a
mathematical or logical model"
60.77,3.12,"and we will go into implementation
details later."
63.89,3.89,"Okay so let's get started. A graph just
like a tree"
67.78,3.199,"is a collection of objects or entities that
we call"
70.979,3.851,"nodes or vertices, connected to each
other through"
74.83,3.34,a set of edges. But in a tree
78.17,4.769,"connections are bound to be in a certain
way. In a tree that our rules"
82.939,3.331,"dictating the connection among the nodes.
In a tree with"
86.27,3.059,"N Nodes, we must have exactly"
89.329,3.551,N - 1 edges. One edge for
92.88,3.47,"each parent child relationship. As
we know an edge"
96.35,4.479,"in a tree is for a parent child
relationship and all nodes in a tree"
100.829,4.801,"except the root node would have apparent
would have exactly 1 parent"
105.63,4.83,"and that's why if they are N nodes, it
must be exactly N - 1 edges."
110.46,3.439,"In a tree, all nodes must be reachable
from the root"
113.899,4.051,"and there must be exactly one possible
path from root"
117.95,3.4,"to a node. Now in a graph there are no
rules"
121.35,3.839,"dictating the connection among the nodes.
A graph contains"
125.189,3.111,a set of nodes and a set of edges
128.3,3.57,"and edges can be connecting nodes in any
possible way."
131.87,3.869,"Tree is only a special kind of graph.
Now graph"
135.739,3.5,"as a concept has been studied
extensively in mathematics."
139.239,3.031,"If you have taken a course on discrete
mathematics"
142.27,4.99,"then you must be knowing about graphs
already. In computer science, we basically"
147.26,3.38,"study and implement the same concept
of graph from mathematics."
150.64,3.319,"The study of graph is often referred to
as"
153.959,3.301,graph theory. In pure mathematical terms
157.26,3.08,we can define graph something like this.
160.34,4.66,"A graph G is in order pair of a set
V of vertices"
165.0,5.31,"and a set E of edges. Now I'm using
some mathematical jargon here."
170.31,3.88,"An ordered pair is just a pair of
mathematical objects"
174.19,3.26,in which the order of objects in the pair
177.45,3.6,"matters. This is how we write and
represent an ordered"
181.05,4.28,"pair, objects separated by comma put
within parenthesis."
185.33,4.14,"Now because the order here matters. We
can say that V"
189.47,3.79,"is the first object in the pair and E
is the second object."
193.26,4.14,"An ordered pair A, B is not equal to B, A"
197.4,3.169,unless A and B are equal.
200.569,3.871,"In our definition of graph here, first
object in the pair"
204.44,5.53,"must always be a set of vertices and
the second object must be a set of edges"
209.97,3.579,"that's why we are calling the pair 
an ordered pair."
213.549,4.491,"We also have concept of unordered pair.
An unordered pair"
218.04,3.979,"is simply a set of two elements. Order is
not important here."
222.019,3.541,"We write an unordered pair using curly
brackets or braces."
225.56,3.75,"Because the order is not important here,
unordered pair"
229.31,5.16,"A, B is equal to B, A. It doesn't matter
which object is first and"
234.47,3.57,"which object is second. Okay coming back,
so"
238.04,3.919,"a graph of is an ordered pair of a set of
vertices and a set of"
241.959,4.881,"edges and G = (V,E) is a formal
mathematical notation"
246.84,3.94,"that we use to define a graph. Now I
have a graph drawn here"
250.78,4.269,"in the right. This graph is 8 vertices
and 10 edges."
255.049,4.231,"What I want to do is I want give some
names to these vertices"
259.28,3.69,"because each node in a graph must
have some identification."
262.97,3.94,It can be a name or it can be an index.
266.91,3.11,"I'm naming these vertices as V1, V2"
270.02,5.91,"V3, V4, V5 and so on, and this
naming is not indicative of any order."
275.93,3.459,"There is no 1st, 2nd and 3rd Node here. I could
give"
279.389,4.181,"any name to any node. So my set of 
vertices here"
283.57,4.99,"is this. We have 8 elements in the
set V1, V2, V3, V4,"
288.56,6.3,"V5, V6, V7 and V8. So this is my set of
vertices for this graph."
294.86,3.67,"Now what's my set of edges. To answer
this"
298.53,3.88,"we first need to know how to represent
an edge."
302.41,3.379,"An edge is uniquely identified by it's
2"
305.789,5.181,"endpoints, so we can just write the names
of the two endpoint"
310.97,5.699,"of an edge as a pair and it can be
a representation for the edge."
316.669,3.291,"But edges can be of two types. We can
have"
319.96,4.019,"a directed edge in which connection is
one-way"
323.979,4.641,"or we can have an undirected edge in
which connection is two way."
328.62,4.23,"In this example graph that I'm showing
here, edges are undirected"
332.85,3.7,"but if you remember the tree that I had
shown earlier"
336.55,4.51,"then we had directed edges in that tree.
With this directed edge that I'm showing"
341.06,0.8,"you here,"
341.86,3.39,we are saying that there is link or path
345.25,5.199,"from vertex U to V but we cannot
assume a path from V to U."
350.449,3.19,"This connection is one way. For
a directed edge,"
353.639,5.051,"one of the endpoints would be the
origin and other end point would be"
358.69,3.09,the destination and we draw the edge with
361.78,3.6,"an arrow head pointing towards the
destination."
365.38,4.879,"For our edge here, origin is U and
destination is V."
370.259,3.681,"A directed edge can be to represented as
an ordered pair,"
373.94,3.9,"first element in the pair can be the
origin and second element can be the"
377.84,1.77,destination.
379.61,3.309,"So with this directed edge represented
as ordered pair"
382.919,3.981,"(U,V), we have a path from U to V."
386.9,3.389,"If we want a path from V to U, when need
to draw"
390.289,3.321,"another directed edge here with V as 
origin"
393.61,4.709,"and U as destination and this edge can be
the represented as ordered pair"
398.319,4.741,"(V,U), the upper one here is (U,V) and the
below one is"
403.06,3.28,"(V,U) and they are not same."
406.34,3.01,"Now if the edge is undirected, the
connection"
409.35,4.05,"is 2 way and undirected edge can be
to represented as an"
413.4,3.88,"unordered pair here because the edge is
bi directional"
417.28,4.479,"origin and destination are not fixed. We
only need to know what two end points"
421.759,2.25,have been connected by the edge.
424.009,4.301,"So now that we know how to present edges,
we can write the set of edges for this"
428.31,1.75,example graph here.
430.06,4.15,"We have an undirected edge between V1
and V2"
434.21,5.359,"then we have 1 between V1 and V3 and
then be have V1 V4."
439.569,3.301,"This is really simple and just go ahead
and write all of them."
442.87,3.75,"So this is my set of edges. Typically in
a graph,"
446.62,3.94,"all edges would either be directed or
undirected."
450.56,3.8,"It's possible for a graph to have both
directed and undirected edges"
454.36,4.459,"but we are not going to study such
graphs, we are only going to study graphs"
458.819,3.451,"in which all edges would either be
directed or"
462.27,3.19,"undirected. A graph with all directed
edges"
465.46,3.739,is called a directed graph or digraph
469.199,5.22,"and a graph with all undirected ages is
called an undirected graph."
474.419,3.361,"There is no special name for an
undirected graph."
477.78,4.289,"Usually, if the graph directed, we
explicitly say that it's"
482.069,4.371,"directed graph or digraph. So these are
two types of graphs."
486.44,3.12,Directed graph or digraph in which edges
489.56,3.259,are uni-directional or ordered pairs and
492.819,3.621,"undirected graph in which edges are
bi-directional"
496.44,4.39,"or unordered pairs. Now many real-world
systems and"
500.83,4.61,"problems can be modeled using a graph.
Graphs can be used to represent"
505.44,3.05,"any collection of objects having some
kind of"
508.49,4.979,"pairwise relationship. Let's have a look
at some of the interesting examples."
513.469,3.901,"A social network like Facebook can be
represented as an"
517.37,4.06,"undirected graph. A user would be a node in
the graph"
521.43,4.58,"and if 2 user are friends, there
would be an edge connecting them."
526.01,4.0,"A real social network would have millions
and billions of nodes."
530.01,3.63,"I can show only few in my diagram here
because I'm short of space."
533.64,4.02,"Now social network is an undirected
graphs because friendship"
537.66,4.2,"is a mutual relationship. If I'm your
friend, you are my friend too."
541.86,3.87,"So connections have to be 2 way. Now once
a system"
545.73,4.32,"is modeled as a graph a lot of problems
can easily be solved"
550.05,3.71,"by applying standard algorithms
in graph theory."
553.76,3.759,"Like here in this social network, let's
say we want to do something like"
557.519,4.931,"suggest friends to a user. Let's say we
want to suggest some connections to"
562.45,1.28,Rama.
563.73,4.25,"One possible approach to do so can be
suggesting friends of friends"
567.98,3.93,"who are not connected already. Rama has
3 friends,"
571.91,3.02,"Ella, Bob and Katie and friends of"
574.93,3.07,"3 that are not connected to Rama
already"
578.0,3.839,"can be suggested. There is no friend of
Ella which is not connected to Rama"
581.839,1.021,already.
582.86,3.61,"Bob however, has 3 friends Tom, Sam,"
586.47,4.44,"and Lee that are not friends with Rama so
they can be suggested"
590.91,3.19,and katie has two friends Lee and Swati
594.1,3.609,"that are not connected to Rama.We have
counted Lee already,"
597.709,4.721,"so in all we can suggest these for users
to Rama."
602.43,4.27,"Now even though we described this
problem in context of a social network."
606.7,3.68,"This is a standard graph problem. The
problem here in"
610.38,4.22,"pure graph terms is finding all nodes
having lenght of"
614.6,3.429,"shortest path from a given
node equal to 2."
618.029,3.541,"Standard algorithms can be applied to
solve this problem."
621.57,3.42,"We'll talk about concepts like path in
a graph in some time."
624.99,3.65,"For now just know that the problem that
we just described in context of"
628.64,3.59,"a social network is a standard graph
problem."
632.23,4.71,"Okay so a social network like Facebook
is an undirected graph"
636.94,3.22,"Now let's have a look at another example.
Interlinked"
640.16,3.52,"web pages on the internet or the World
Wide Web"
643.68,4.05,"can be represented as a directed graph.
A web page"
647.73,4.599,"that would have a unique address or URL
would be a node in the graph"
652.329,5.811,"and we can have a directed edge if a
page contains link to another page."
658.14,3.46,"Now once again, there are billions of pages
on the web"
661.6,4.83,"but I can show only few here. The edges
in this graph are directed because"
666.43,3.149,"that relationship is not mutual this
time."
669.579,5.021,"If page A has a link to page B then
it's not necessary that page B will"
674.6,1.45,also have a link to page A.
676.05,3.74,"Let's say one of the pages on
mycodeschool.com has"
679.79,3.02,a tutorial on graph and on this page
682.81,3.56,"I have put a link to Wikipedia article on
graph."
686.37,3.339,"Let's assume that in this example
graph that I am showing you here."
689.709,3.671,"Page P is my mycodeschool tutorial
on graph"
693.38,4.32,"with this address or URL 
mycodeschool.com/videos/graph"
697.7,4.84,"and lets say, page Q is the
Wikipedia article on graph"
702.54,3.789,with this URL Wikipedia/org/wiki/graph.
706.329,3.07,Now on my page that is page
709.399,3.62,"P, I have put a link to the Wikipedia page on
graph."
713.019,5.471,"If you are on page P, you can click on
this link and go to page Q"
718.49,3.589,"but Wikipedia has not reciprocated
to my favor by putting"
722.079,3.931,"a link back to my page. So if you are on
page Q"
726.01,3.67,"you cannot click on the link can
come to page P. Connection here"
729.68,4.19,"is one way and that's why we have
drawn a directed egde here."
733.87,3.6,"Okay now once again if we are able to
present"
737.47,4.919,"web as a directed graph, we can apply
standard graph theory algorithms to"
742.389,3.091,solve problems and to perform tasks.
745.48,4.74,"One of the tasks that search engines
like Google perform very regularly"
750.22,5.239,"is web crawling. Search engines use a
program called web crawler"
755.459,3.411,"that systematically browsers the 
World Wide Web"
758.87,4.48,"to collect and store data about web
pages. Search engines can then use this"
763.35,0.549,data
763.899,4.421,"to provide quick and accurate results
against search queries."
768.32,4.23,"Now even though in this context, we are
using a nice and heavy term like web"
772.55,0.65,crawling.
773.2,3.22,"Web crawling is basically graph
traversal"
776.42,4.64,"or in simpler words, act of visiting all
nodes in a graph"
781.06,4.04,"and no prizes for guessing that there
are standard algorithms for graph"
785.1,1.2,traversal.
786.3,3.65,"We will be studying graph traversal
algorithms in a later lessons."
789.95,3.79,"Okay now the next thing that I want to
talk about is concept of a"
793.74,5.539,"weighted graph. Sometimes in a graph, all
connections cannot be treated as equal."
799.279,3.101,"Some connections can be preferable to
others"
802.38,3.17,like for example we can represent
805.55,3.67,"intercity road network that is the
network of highways and"
809.22,4.239,"free ways between cities as an
undirected graph."
813.459,3.461,"I'm assuming that all highways would be
bi-directional."
816.92,4.14,"Intra-city road network that is road
network within a city"
821.06,3.35,would definitely have one-way roads and so
824.41,4.01,"Intra-city network must be
represented as a directed graph"
828.42,3.659,"but intercity road network in my opinion
can be represented as an"
832.079,4.921,"undirected graph. Now clearly we cannot
treat all connections as equal here."
837.0,3.93,"Roads would be of different lengths and
to perform a lot of tasks"
840.93,4.43,"to solve a lot of problems, we need to
take length of roads into account."
845.36,3.289,"In such cases, we associate some weight or"
848.649,4.12,"cost with every edge. We label the edges with
their weights."
852.769,4.991,"In this case weight can be lenght of the roads,
so what to do here is I'll just"
857.76,4.319,"label this edges with some values for
the lenghts."
862.079,3.37,Let's say these values are in kilometers
865.449,5.121,"and now edges in this graph are weighted and
this graph can be called weighted"
870.57,0.629,graph.
871.199,4.01,"Let's say in this graph, we want to
pick the best route"
875.209,3.281,from city A to city D.
878.49,3.49,"Have a look at these four possible
routes, I am showing them in different"
881.98,1.219,colors.
883.199,3.151,Now if I would treat all edges as equal
886.35,3.979,"then I would say that the green route
through B and C"
890.329,4.171,"and a red route through E and F are equally
good."
894.5,4.17,"Both these paths have to three edges and
this yellow route through E"
898.67,4.419,"is the best because we have only two
edges in this path."
903.089,4.321,"But with different weights assigned to
the connections, I need to add up"
907.41,3.64,"weights of edges in a path to calculate
total cost."
911.05,3.149,"When I'm taking weight into account shortest
route"
914.199,4.091,"is through B and C. Connections have
different weights and"
918.29,3.81,"this is really important here in this
graph. Actually, we can look at all the"
922.1,2.38,graphs as weighted graphs
924.48,3.12,"An unweighted graph can basically be seen
as"
927.6,3.22,"a weighted graph in which weight of all
the edges"
930.82,4.889,"is same and typically we assume to weight
as one."
935.709,4.0,"Okay so we have represented inter-city cities
road network as"
939.709,6.201,"weighted undirected graph. Social network
was an unweighted undirected graph"
945.91,4.03,"and World Wide Web was an unweighted
directed graph"
949.94,3.92,and this one is a weighted undirected graph.
953.86,4.33,"Now this was inter-city road network. I
think intra-city road network that is"
958.19,3.74,"road network within a city can be
modeled as"
961.93,4.99,"a weighted directed graph because in a
city that would be some one ways."
966.92,3.33,"Intersections in interest city's road
network would be Nodes"
970.25,4.38,"and road segments would be our edges,"
974.63,4.69,"and by the way we can also draw an
undirected graph as directed."
979.32,4.769,"It's just that for each undirected edge
we will have 2 directed edges."
984.089,3.761,"We may not be able to redraw a directed
graph has undirected"
987.85,4.2,"but we can always redraw an undirected
graph as directed."
992.05,4.779,"Okay I'll stop here now. This much is
good for an introductory lesson."
996.829,3.211,"In next lesson, we will talk about some more
properties of graph."
1000.04,2.299,"This is it for this lesson. Thanks for
watching !"
