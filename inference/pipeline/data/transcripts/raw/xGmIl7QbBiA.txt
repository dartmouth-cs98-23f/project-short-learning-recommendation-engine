second,duration,transcript
11.519,5.52,hey everyone i'm sure you're all aware
14.4,4.56,that every application that we use today
17.039,4.32,has something called the front end which
18.96,4.64,is the user interface and the back end
21.359,4.881,which is the software that accesses data
23.6,4.56,for us and finally we have the database
26.24,4.32,to store the data
28.16,5.44,now these three together form something
30.56,5.2,called as the full stack so hi guys
33.6,4.56,welcome to this video on what is full
35.76,4.319,stack by simply learn but before we
38.16,3.919,begin if you haven't subscribed to our
40.079,4.081,channel already make sure to hit the
42.079,4.241,subscribe button and the bell icon to
44.16,3.28,never miss an update so here's what's in
46.32,2.64,store for you
47.44,3.76,first we'll have a look at what
48.96,3.759,front-end development is
51.2,3.039,then we'll see some of the front-end
52.719,3.68,languages
54.239,4.96,then we'll move on to some front-end
56.399,4.721,libraries and frameworks
59.199,2.641,then we'll see what back-end development
61.12,2.88,is
61.84,4.48,understand some of the popularly used
64.0,4.0,back-end languages and frameworks
66.32,2.88,and finally we'll have a look at the
68.0,3.68,database
69.2,4.88,so now what exactly is front-end every
71.68,4.96,time you open a website it has several
74.08,5.6,ui components and once you click on a
76.64,5.119,particular icon say sign in in this case
79.68,5.119,you get navigated to the sign in or the
81.759,5.841,login page right so what happens is that
84.799,4.481,all of these items facilitate navigation
87.6,3.76,and utility
89.28,3.519,these are collectively called as the
91.36,3.439,front end
92.799,4.32,so the front end is the visible part of
94.799,4.721,the website or the web application which
97.119,4.481,is responsible for user experience
99.52,4.239,the user directly interacts with the
101.6,4.799,front-end portion of the website or the
103.759,4.161,web application
106.399,3.201,so now let's have a look at some of the
107.92,4.239,front-end languages
109.6,4.64,so i'm sure you've heard of html css and
112.159,4.0,javascript so these are collectively
114.24,4.72,called the frontend languages when it
116.159,5.761,comes to html it defines the structure
118.96,6.0,of websites and formats the web pages
121.92,5.12,it also defines text documentation so
124.96,4.24,let's look at a simple example
127.04,4.48,so here i've made use of the h1 tag
129.2,5.119,which is the heading tag in html and
131.52,5.6,i've displayed the message hello welcome
134.319,4.321,so correspondingly my website displays
137.12,4.479,the same message
138.64,5.52,so html is responsible or it defines
141.599,5.921,what is being shown on the website
144.16,5.36,next up is css now css is a style sheet
147.52,4.96,that allows you to alter and style
149.52,6.079,different web components beat size
152.48,6.24,font spacing etc it makes the content on
155.599,5.521,the website look more decorative correct
158.72,4.48,so now if you have a look at the code
161.12,4.32,here i've added some styling i've
163.2,4.72,changed the font style to italic i've
165.44,5.12,made the text bold and i've changed the
167.92,6.24,color to red and again correspondingly
170.56,6.319,all the changes are seen on the website
174.16,4.56,moving on we have javascript now
176.879,4.321,javascript is a very powerful
178.72,4.4,client-side scripting language and it is
181.2,5.28,mainly used for enhancing the
183.12,5.28,interaction of a user with the web page
186.48,4.399,so again if you have a look at the code
188.4,4.559,here i have created a form wherein the
190.879,3.681,user can enter their name and i've also
192.959,4.081,displayed the message please enter your
194.56,4.56,name as a result an input box is made
197.04,4.8,available where the user can type in
199.12,5.039,their name now this is facilitated by
201.84,4.479,javascript so as i mentioned earlier it
204.159,4.72,is used to make web pages interactive
206.319,4.161,and bring the web applications to life
208.879,4.08,so next let's have a look at some
210.48,4.56,front-end frameworks and libraries now
212.959,4.961,most of these are javascript frameworks
215.04,5.6,and libraries first we have react
217.92,4.399,then there's angular there's view
220.64,2.879,there's jquery and then there's
222.319,4.161,bootstrap
223.519,5.121,now all of these help develop the front
226.48,4.319,end of the application however when it
228.64,4.48,comes to react angular in view it's not
230.799,5.121,necessary that you must know everything
233.12,5.28,to create a website one of them will be
235.92,4.72,sufficient however the usage of react is
238.4,5.119,on the rise and most of the developers
240.64,4.4,prefer using react jquery and bootstrap
243.519,3.841,are also powerful
245.04,4.8,frameworks that can be used to create
247.36,4.72,interactive web pages now that you know
249.84,4.16,what front-end development is you must
252.08,3.68,be wondering how the data is being
254.0,4.079,fetched and how this data is being
255.76,5.439,presented in front of you on your screen
258.079,5.601,correct now this is all facilitated by
261.199,5.761,the back end of the application so let's
263.68,5.44,understand what back-end development is
266.96,3.519,now back-end basically refers to the
269.12,3.04,server-side development of the
270.479,4.321,application
272.16,4.88,it is responsible for managing all the
274.8,4.56,database with the help of queries and
277.04,4.8,apis so every time the user makes a
279.36,4.559,request it queries the database and
281.84,4.16,retrieves the data from the database and
283.919,5.681,presents it to the user
286.0,5.6,and lastly it ensures data consistency
289.6,4.48,so now let's have a look at some backend
291.6,5.599,languages and frameworks
294.08,6.64,firstly we have node node and express.js
297.199,5.601,are packages provided by javascript
300.72,4.0,then there's python which is a very
302.8,4.48,popularly used language
304.72,3.36,python frameworks like django and flask
307.28,3.359,are
308.08,4.0,popularly used to create the backend of
310.639,4.721,applications
312.08,5.52,then there's java and java provides
315.36,4.64,spring and java server faces which are
317.6,3.599,also used for back-end development
320.0,3.199,then there's
321.199,5.761,c-sharp which provides frameworks like
323.199,6.641,asp.net core and asp.net mvc and other
326.96,5.2,popularly used backend languages are php
329.84,4.0,there's perl and ruby
332.16,3.759,database is the collection of
333.84,4.639,interrelated data which helps an
335.919,4.72,efficient retrieval insertion and
338.479,4.56,deletion of data from database and
340.639,4.641,organizes the data in the form of tables
343.039,4.081,views schemas reports
345.28,4.8,now some of the commonly used database
347.12,6.56,management systems are mysql there's
350.08,5.44,postgresql there's microsoft sql server
353.68,4.48,there's oracle database and then there's
355.52,5.2,mongodb but how can we at simply learn
358.16,4.4,help you if you wish to make a career as
360.72,4.4,a full stack developer then a
362.56,4.079,certification will come in handy for
365.12,3.44,that you could head to our official

399.919,2.481,know more
402.479,4.0,mobile and web applications are
404.4,4.72,something that we practically can't live
406.479,4.641,without from ordering food to booking
409.12,3.919,flight tickets to making important bank
411.12,4.799,transactions
413.039,4.88,these apps have made our lives easier
415.919,5.12,to cope with the changing demands with
417.919,4.881,respect to user experience and security
421.039,3.44,web development needs to take a robust
422.8,4.0,and efficient approach
424.479,5.201,this video tells you what the future of
426.8,5.2,web development will look like
429.68,4.32,so let's begin by understanding what web
432.0,4.319,development is
434.0,4.24,a web development involves building and
436.319,3.6,maintaining website and other web
438.24,4.399,applications
439.919,5.441,a web developer is expected to convert a
442.639,4.96,web design into a website
445.36,4.959,they're responsible for how a website or
447.599,5.281,web application looks and functions from
450.319,6.481,its user interface and page layout to
452.88,6.56,back-end systems for gathering data
456.8,5.2,so a lot goes into building a website
459.44,4.159,there are several tools frameworks and
462.0,3.52,packages that help create web
463.599,5.121,applications
465.52,6.48,html css javascript are the basic
468.72,4.96,languages required to develop a website
472.0,3.759,javascript offers
473.68,4.799,several frameworks and libraries like
475.759,4.56,react angular and view
478.479,5.28,javascript and its environment like
480.319,5.841,node.js and express js
483.759,4.481,node is an open source clock cross
486.16,4.879,platform runtime environment that allows
488.24,4.88,developers to create server-side tools
491.039,4.321,and javascript applications
493.12,6.72,knowledge of the basic command line like
495.36,7.04,npm node package manager is essential
499.84,4.56,but i'm sure you're aware of all this so
502.4,4.479,what's going to be new
504.4,5.44,well according to experts there are four
506.879,5.201,major future trends in web development
509.84,4.319,so let's start and decode them one by
512.08,4.48,one
514.159,5.68,first up is typescript
516.56,5.599,typescript is a superset of javascript
519.839,3.76,and is an object oriented programming
522.159,3.761,language
523.599,4.081,in simple terms it is just javascript
525.92,3.039,with other impressive additional
527.68,3.599,features
528.959,4.481,typescript supports all javascript
531.279,5.281,libraries and frameworks with an
533.44,6.16,increase in code complexity javascript
536.56,5.04,had to fulfill the requirements of oop
539.6,3.679,hence that lead to the introduction of
541.6,3.84,typestrip
543.279,6.321,typescript helps with quicker code
545.44,5.92,development thus improving performance
549.6,4.32,there are a few improvements with
551.36,4.96,typestrip that give it an upper hand
553.92,4.4,over javascript
556.32,4.72,only at the time of development does
558.32,4.8,typescript bring out compilation issues
561.04,4.4,this reduces the chances of mistakes
563.12,4.48,occurring at runtime
565.44,5.28,a property of typescript is that it is
567.6,5.679,strongly typed or enables static typing
570.72,5.04,static typing allows type correctness to
573.279,6.401,be checked at compilation time
575.76,6.48,in javascript this isn't possible
579.68,4.719,typescript is nothing but javascript and
582.24,4.64,some additional features
584.399,4.641,ie es6 features
586.88,5.6,some of these features are interfaces
589.04,6.4,generics namespaces null checking and
592.48,5.44,access modifiers
595.44,4.56,typescript supports intellisense which
597.92,3.52,provides active hints as the code is
600.0,4.0,added
601.44,4.32,so considering all these advantages
604.0,5.839,typescript is something that will be
605.76,4.079,widely adopted by teams across the globe
610.32,4.72,next up is webassembly
612.72,3.28,webassembly is a new way to run on the
615.04,3.919,web
616.0,5.44,webassembly or wasm is the second
618.959,5.601,universal programming language that all
621.44,5.36,web browsers can understand and run
624.56,4.64,however you're not going to be writing
626.8,4.4,scripts in web assembly yourself
629.2,4.0,it's a low level assembly language
631.2,4.4,designed to be very close to compile
633.2,4.24,machine code and very close to native
635.6,4.4,performance
637.44,5.2,what this means is practice
640.0,4.56,is that javascript is no longer the only
642.64,4.879,language you can run on the web
644.56,4.48,web browsers can run any language now if
647.519,2.721,that language has a web assembly
649.04,3.2,compiler
650.24,4.64,even traditional desktop languages like
652.24,6.8,c plus plus and rust can be compiled
654.88,8.48,down to wasm with relative ease
659.04,8.0,wasm currently runs in 94 of users
663.36,6.0,browsers with ie uc browser and oprah
667.04,5.039,mini support being the main things
669.36,5.12,holding it back as per usual
672.079,5.521,however it's backed by developers from
674.48,5.599,mozilla microsoft google and apple
677.6,4.88,and support in modern browsers is fast
680.079,2.401,moving
682.88,4.8,next up we have package managers
686.56,3.519,packages
687.68,5.36,a package manager or package management
690.079,5.281,system is a collection of software tools
693.04,4.72,that automates the process of installing
695.36,4.24,upgrading configuring and removing
697.76,5.84,software packages for a computer's
699.6,6.32,operating system in a consistent manner
703.6,4.56,it typically maintains a database of
705.92,3.84,software dependencies and version
708.16,5.919,information to prevent software
709.76,6.56,mismatches and missing prerequisites
714.079,4.88,npm is the package manager for the node
716.32,5.519,javascript platform it puts modules in
718.959,4.88,place so that node can find them and
721.839,3.521,manages dependency conflicts
723.839,4.081,intelligently
725.36,6.08,it is extremely configurable to support
727.92,5.84,a wide variety of use cases
731.44,4.48,yarn is another package manager that
733.76,4.639,replaces the existing workflow for the
735.92,5.039,npm client or other package managers
738.399,3.761,while remaining compatible with the npm
740.959,3.68,registry
742.16,4.64,it has the same feature said as exciting
744.639,4.801,workflows
746.8,5.599,while operating faster more securely and
749.44,2.959,more reliably
752.56,5.2,lastly we have javascript dialects
755.76,4.319,compiler to javascript
757.76,4.56,there are many javascript dialects like
760.079,3.361,coffeescript darn
762.32,2.48,babel
763.44,4.079,typescript
764.8,5.2,and sweaty that offers better features
767.519,4.081,that javascript and ultimately compile
770.0,3.44,to javascript
771.6,3.76,it is likely that these languages will
773.44,3.68,be the future
775.36,4.64,there are several other predictions like
777.12,4.56,better appreciation for web standard
780.0,4.399,less client works
781.68,5.2,and more focus on personal projects
784.399,4.721,and the need to know more languages
786.88,4.639,regardless the future of web development
789.12,5.519,looks more promising than ever if you
791.519,5.041,wish to make a career as a web developer
794.639,3.521,start now
796.56,4.32,so where do you think the future of web
