6.24,4.64,hello everyone welcome back in this
8.96,4.32,presentation let's focus on the
10.88,4.4,introduction to data models
13.28,4.8,let's directly step into the topic of
15.28,5.04,today the data models what do we mean by
18.08,4.4,this data model this data model is
20.32,5.36,actually the underlying structure of a
22.48,5.44,database what do we mean by this
25.68,4.8,actually this data model is a conceptual
27.92,4.96,tool that describes the data the
30.48,5.04,relationship among the data the data
32.88,4.72,semantics and the constraints what do we
35.52,4.4,mean by this see we know basically a
37.6,4.959,database is actually a collection of
39.92,3.92,interrelated data when we say that it is
42.559,3.68,going to be the collection of
43.84,4.64,interrelated data we know basically this
46.239,4.64,is going to store the data it's going to
48.48,4.48,store the interrelated data i mean the
50.879,4.481,relationship among the data is also
52.96,5.279,existing we also need to deal with the
55.36,4.879,data semantics and the constraints i
58.239,4.64,mean what kind of data are stored what
60.239,5.681,kind of data are not permitted all these
62.879,5.361,things so we obviously need data models
65.92,4.879,in order to deal with the databases so
68.24,5.44,this data model is actually acting as a
70.799,5.68,conceptual tool that describes the data
73.68,5.28,the data relationship the data semantics
76.479,5.121,and the data constraints so obviously we
78.96,5.44,need to design the database at physical
81.6,4.879,level logical level and the view level
84.4,4.48,we know databases uses three tier
86.479,4.241,architecture so we need to design or we
88.88,4.72,need to look into the database in the
90.72,5.92,design perspective at three levels one
93.6,5.92,the physical level two the logical level
96.64,5.04,three the final one is the view level we
99.52,4.559,are done with the basics of data model
101.68,4.64,let's now see the various categories of
104.079,3.841,data model in this presentation we are
106.32,4.4,going to focus on four different
107.92,5.199,categories of data model the first one
110.72,4.719,is the relational model the second one
113.119,4.96,is the entity relationship model the
115.439,4.801,third one is the object-based data model
118.079,4.64,and the last one is the semi-structured
120.24,4.559,data model of course we have other data
122.719,4.08,models as well but in this presentation
124.799,4.16,we are going to focus only on these four
126.799,4.881,data models let's start with the first
128.959,4.961,data model the relational model
131.68,4.559,basically a database is a collection of
133.92,4.8,tables and we know this table is going
136.239,4.881,to collect or store the data and these
138.72,4.48,tables are also going to establish or
141.12,4.8,maintain the relationship among the
143.2,4.8,tables so what do we mean by this see we
145.92,4.399,are going to store the data in databases
148.0,4.16,where databases are collection of tables
150.319,4.56,and these tables are going to store the
152.16,4.799,data in the form of rows and columns
154.879,3.601,let's say we have two tables one is the
156.959,3.761,student table other one is the
158.48,3.759,instructor table and this student table
160.72,3.68,is going to contain the information
162.239,4.0,about the student and obviously the
164.4,4.559,instructor table is going to store the
166.239,4.321,data about the instructors now obviously
168.959,4.401,student and instructor are somehow
170.56,4.72,related isn't it the relationship is
173.36,4.959,also a table in this case so in
175.28,4.56,relational model everything is of tables
178.319,3.84,the data are obviously going to be
179.84,4.16,stored in the table and the relationship
182.159,3.761,are also represented in the form of
184.0,3.76,tables no worries when we see some
185.92,4.399,examples you will be able to understand
187.76,5.28,things so in relational model everything
190.319,5.041,is represented in the form of tables and
193.04,5.279,we know basically a table is going to
195.36,4.959,contain multiple columns and each column
198.319,3.92,in the table will have unique names
200.319,4.321,likewise in a database we may have
202.239,4.881,multiple tables and each table will have
204.64,4.319,unique names so in relational model we
207.12,3.839,have multiple columns in the table with
208.959,4.241,the unique names and we may also have
210.959,4.64,multiple tables with a unique name in a
213.2,5.119,database now why it is named as a
215.599,5.2,relational model because in rtbms the
218.319,5.761,relational database management system we
220.799,5.44,refer tables as relations because in
224.08,4.239,relational model everything is of
226.239,4.321,relation obviously the data are going to
228.319,4.401,be stored in the relation or table only
230.56,4.16,and the relationship among the data or
232.72,4.48,the relationship among the table is also
234.72,4.239,going to be stored in a relation only
237.2,4.239,and this relational model is also
238.959,5.521,referred as a record-based model and
241.439,5.201,what is a record it is actually a fixed
244.48,4.479,format records of several types of
246.64,4.959,several data types i will explain about
248.959,5.041,this when we see an example so in simple
251.599,5.121,terms relational model is also referred
254.0,5.84,as a record-based model and what is a
256.72,6.08,record actually each record defines a
259.84,5.12,fixed number of fields or attributes say
262.8,4.399,if we say something as a record each
264.96,4.64,record is going to have a fixed number
267.199,4.241,of fields or attributes don't worry
269.6,4.319,about this now in the next slide we are
271.44,5.6,going to see some examples now is this
273.919,6.081,model widely used yes this relational
277.04,5.439,model is the most widely used data model
280.0,5.04,in this contemporary world so when i say
282.479,4.801,this is the most widely used data model
285.04,4.719,obviously the current database systems
287.28,4.08,are based on the relational model only
289.759,4.081,so we are done with the basics of
291.36,7.119,relational model before we step into the
293.84,4.639,next data model let's see an example
298.88,3.52,let's say this is the relational
300.4,4.639,database management system or simply
302.4,5.359,rdbms where this database management
305.039,4.561,system is a collection of databases and
307.759,4.321,we know databases are actually
309.6,4.8,collection of tables and we know a table
312.08,4.24,is a collection of various fields and
314.4,4.48,the collection of various fields are
316.32,4.719,referred as the record say if we talk
318.88,4.56,about an employee relation or an
321.039,4.401,employee table let's say this employee
323.44,5.52,table contains four attributes or four
325.44,6.0,columns first name last name salary and
328.96,4.959,department number and this particular
331.44,5.52,relation has four columns or four
333.919,5.761,attributes the first name last name
336.96,7.04,salary and department number can you see
339.68,6.64,here tom 4 30 0003 this complete
344.0,4.4,information are referred as a record
346.32,4.64,where this record is actually having
348.4,5.04,four fields the first name field the
350.96,4.88,last name field salary and department
353.44,4.72,number fields so in simple terms a
355.84,4.079,record is a collection of fields and
358.16,3.68,collection of fields are referred as a
359.919,4.081,table and collection of tables are
361.84,4.479,referred as database and collection of
364.0,5.12,databases are referred as the relational
366.319,5.041,database management system so in simple
369.12,4.4,terms in relational database system
371.36,4.559,multiple relations are there each
373.52,4.72,relation is actually a table and each
375.919,4.241,table will contain multiple fields and
378.24,3.12,the collection of fields are referred as
380.16,3.36,records
381.36,4.399,we also see a diagram here don't worry
383.52,4.08,about this now in the next data model we
385.759,4.16,will see about this
387.6,4.719,so we are done with the first data model
389.919,5.361,the relational data model let's now move
392.319,5.921,on to the next data model the er model
395.28,4.72,the entity relationship model so this
398.24,4.56,entity relationship model is also
400.0,6.24,referred as the er data model or simply
402.8,5.839,er model so e stands for entity r stands
406.24,5.359,for relationship what do we mean by this
408.639,5.041,entity we know basically this er model
411.599,4.481,is actually a collection of basic
413.68,4.56,objects and these objects are referred
416.08,4.48,as entities and when we say this is a
418.24,4.16,collection of multiple entities and
420.56,4.0,obviously there will be relationship
422.4,4.4,among entities right so there will be a
424.56,4.639,relationship among student entity as
426.8,4.88,well as instructor entity and when we
429.199,4.801,say this entity is a collection of basic
431.68,4.48,objects these objects are real-world
434.0,5.12,entities or real-world things right so
436.16,5.759,we can say an entity is a real world
439.12,4.72,thing or object and when we say that
441.919,4.961,this entity is a real world thing or
443.84,5.28,object obviously each entity or each
446.88,5.12,object is distinguishable from other
449.12,6.0,objects now is this er model is widely
452.0,5.52,used yes like relational model er model
455.12,4.96,is also widely used but the important
457.52,5.119,thing to note here about er model is
460.08,4.959,this er model is widely used in the
462.639,4.4,database design before you start
465.039,4.481,creating the database before you start
467.039,4.72,creating the table we are going to use
469.52,4.64,the er model in order to design the
471.759,4.401,database in the previous data model i
474.16,3.759,mean the relational model the current
476.16,4.159,database systems are actually using the
477.919,4.881,relational model whereas here the second
480.319,4.72,data model which is the er model we are
482.8,3.92,going to use this er model for designing
485.039,3.201,the database
486.72,3.759,let's see an example then it will be
488.24,5.04,easy for you to understand here is the
490.479,4.961,example of an er model can you see here
493.28,4.639,everything is referred as an entity this
495.44,5.759,employee is an entity dependent is an
497.919,5.84,entity project department are entities
501.199,6.081,and each entity or each object is
503.759,6.641,described by some attributes salary ssn
507.28,5.199,name gender or sex and name attribute
510.4,4.559,has three more sub attributes the first
512.479,4.721,name middle name and the last name so
514.959,4.08,don't worry about this er model now
517.2,3.839,anyway in the next chapter we are going
519.039,4.161,to exclusively focus on the database
521.039,4.24,design aspects where we are going to see
523.2,4.8,about the er model we are going to see
525.279,5.601,various examples about er model so for
528.0,5.519,now just understand this er model is a
530.88,4.959,schematic or diagrammatic representation
533.519,4.88,so that this can be used for designing
535.839,5.201,the database and also please be noted
538.399,4.721,here that this entity is related to
541.04,4.479,other entity through some relationships
543.12,4.159,can you see here this employee entity
545.519,4.481,has some relationship with other
547.279,4.881,entities like department and project and
550.0,4.72,what is the name of the relationship
552.16,5.04,this employee works for department this
554.72,5.119,works for is a relationship this manages
557.2,5.36,is a relationship works on is also a
559.839,4.961,relationship so this is an entity these
562.56,4.399,are all attributes and these are all the
564.8,4.0,relationship no worries about the
566.959,4.081,terminologies used we are going to
568.8,4.32,exclusively focus on the database design
571.04,4.0,aspects in the next chapter so we are
573.12,4.159,done with the second data model the
575.04,4.479,entity relationship model let's now move
577.279,4.641,on to the third data model the object
579.519,5.601,based model we know object oriented
581.92,5.919,languages like the c plus plus java c
585.12,5.2,ash or c sharp we know these are all the
587.839,4.321,object oriented programming languages
590.32,3.519,suppose if our front end is designed
592.16,3.84,using object oriented programming
593.839,4.56,language we need to have the backend
596.0,4.56,which also supports the front end right
598.399,4.641,so in that case we are in a need for
600.56,4.32,object oriented data model and that is
603.04,3.68,why we are ending up here with the
604.88,4.32,object-based model where this
606.72,4.559,object-based model is actually using the
609.2,4.4,er model with the object-oriented
611.279,4.24,features in the previous data model we
613.6,4.0,have seen about the entity relationship
615.519,4.241,model where we have seen everything is
617.6,4.16,of entities where each entities are
619.76,4.48,referred as an object which are real
621.76,4.639,world entities or real-world things
624.24,4.24,and each real-world entity the objects
626.399,4.081,are distinguishable from other objects
628.48,4.24,so what we are going to do here is in
630.48,4.88,the object-based model we are going to
632.72,4.799,make use of the features of the er model
635.36,5.76,along with the object oriented features
637.519,5.841,like data encapsulation inheritance etc
641.12,4.88,we also have a variation of the
643.36,5.12,object-based data model which is object
646.0,4.24,relational data model where this object
648.48,4.0,relational data model which is the
650.24,4.8,combination of object-based model which
652.48,4.24,is this along with the relational model
655.04,4.08,which is the first data model we have
656.72,4.32,seen object-based model when it is
659.12,4.64,combined with the relational model we
661.04,4.479,get object relational data model
663.76,4.16,before we step into the fourth data
665.519,4.88,model let's see the example so in this
667.92,4.32,example we can see that this is an
670.399,4.401,object person is an object which
672.24,4.8,contains attributes like name age
674.8,4.08,address and phone number so this can
677.04,4.32,also be represented as an er
678.88,4.959,representation this is an entity or an
681.36,3.84,object person which contains attributes
683.839,4.081,like name
685.2,4.48,age address and phone number so don't
687.92,3.919,worry about this now when the course
689.68,4.719,progresses we will be able to understand
691.839,5.281,things clearly so we are done with the
694.399,5.0,third data model the object-based model
697.12,4.8,let's see the last data model the
699.399,4.601,semi-structured data model the name
701.92,4.479,itself says that this data model is
704.0,4.079,already semi-structured
706.399,3.921,it means it's going to deal with the
708.079,5.041,specification of the data what do we
710.32,5.759,mean by this it means the individual
713.12,5.36,data items of the same type may have
716.079,5.121,different sets of attributes what do we
718.48,5.12,mean by this this data model is mainly
721.2,4.16,used for transferring the data among
723.6,4.08,applications so if there are two
725.36,4.479,different applications and data transfer
727.68,4.08,needs to be done obviously data needs to
729.839,4.401,be stored somewhere right in the
731.76,4.8,database if we use semi-structured data
734.24,4.96,model then transferring the data among
736.56,4.48,applications is also easier no worries
739.2,4.079,in the last phase of this subject we are
741.04,5.039,going to exclusively focus on a special
743.279,4.56,language the extensible markup language
746.079,4.56,where we will be understanding clearly
747.839,5.361,about this semi-structured data model so
750.639,4.561,for now just understand two different
753.2,4.4,applications need to communicate with
755.2,4.48,each other and if they want to use the
757.6,4.16,databases then we can go for
759.68,4.88,semi-structured data model where it
761.76,5.12,deals with the specification of data and
764.56,4.48,we can clearly witness that this is
766.88,4.32,contrast to the previous data models we
769.04,3.919,have seen i mean this is contrast to the
771.2,4.079,previous models like the relational
772.959,4.801,model the entity relationship model or
775.279,3.36,simply er model and the object-based
777.76,2.319,model
778.639,3.281,and the language that supports the
780.079,5.121,semi-structured data model is the
781.92,5.68,extensible markup language simply xml
785.2,5.68,before we see the other data models
787.6,5.919,let's see an example for xml say here i
790.88,5.04,am going to create a note where this
793.519,4.56,note is from neso academy to all
795.92,4.56,students and the subject of this note is
798.079,4.641,thank you and the body of this note is
800.48,5.12,thank you for subscribing neso academy
802.72,4.96,good luck and this body ends here and
805.6,4.799,this is the end of the note can you see
807.68,5.279,here this is like the html language but
810.399,5.361,the difference here in html we have
812.959,5.201,predefined tags here we can create our
815.76,4.8,own tags can you see here this is a note
818.16,5.52,where i am creating my own tag this is a
820.56,5.92,note this note has a from field or a
823.68,6.0,from tag so this from is a user defined
826.48,5.359,tag these two subject body and note all
829.68,5.04,are user-defined tag can you see here
831.839,5.36,the hierarchy or even the structure here
834.72,4.799,this note is the parent element and this
837.199,5.2,contains sub elements like from to
839.519,5.12,subject body and this is the end of this
842.399,3.841,note tag i know things will be unclear
844.639,4.161,at the moment but for now just
846.24,5.36,understand the structure this contains
848.8,4.479,the data which is naso academy all
851.6,4.0,students thank you thank you for
853.279,4.321,subscribing neso academy good luck all
855.6,5.12,these are the data that we are going to
857.6,5.52,store or transfer at the same time these
860.72,4.64,data are also structured and this is how
863.12,4.719,it is structured the node is the outer
865.36,5.919,element or the parent tag which contains
867.839,5.841,sub tags like from to subject body and
871.279,5.36,each data has its own structure this
873.68,5.519,data belongs to this from and this data
876.639,4.961,is belonging to two and this is how data
879.199,4.481,is actually structured and stored and
881.6,4.0,that's why we call xml is a
883.68,3.519,semi-structured language
885.6,3.44,and this is what the point two of the
887.199,4.161,semi-structured data model which we have
889.04,4.799,seen in the previous slide says
891.36,4.8,we can have multiple nodes with multiple
893.839,4.881,different elements in this node we have
896.16,5.119,from to subject and body we may have
898.72,4.64,other nodes with all these four elements
901.279,4.881,or without all these four elements or
903.36,4.479,with addition of other elements or tags
906.16,3.919,so we are done with the fourth data
907.839,4.321,model the semi-structured data model
910.079,4.081,before we sign out let's see other data
912.16,4.0,models anyway i'm not going to focus
914.16,4.64,more on these data models because most
916.16,4.56,of these models are obsolete now the
918.8,4.32,first thing is the network data model
920.72,4.32,and the hierarchical data model nowadays
923.12,4.079,we are not using this because these
925.04,4.719,models are tied closely to the
927.199,4.56,underlying implementation if any data
929.759,4.08,model is tied closely to the underlying
931.759,4.241,implementation obviously it is
933.839,4.641,complicating the task of modeling the
936.0,5.12,data and these models are not used
938.48,5.76,nowadays except we have these models in
941.12,4.56,the old databases so these data models
944.24,3.92,like the network data model and
945.68,5.44,hierarchical data model are going to use
948.16,5.2,structures like the trees or graphs
951.12,4.32,and that's it guys in this presentation
953.36,3.76,we have seen about the data models and
955.44,3.6,the various data models like the
957.12,4.48,relational data model the entity
959.04,4.08,relationship or simply er data model
961.6,3.76,object-based data model and
963.12,4.079,semi-structured data model we also have
965.36,4.32,seen other data models that are not
967.199,4.241,widely used nowadays i hope the session
969.68,3.27,is informative and thank you for
971.44,1.69,watching
