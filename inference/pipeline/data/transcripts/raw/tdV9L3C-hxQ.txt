151.02,3.6,Predictive Analytics coming to picture
152.52,4.2,to help predict what might happen in the
154.62,4.02,near future so let us dive deep into
156.72,3.659,what productive analytics is and how it
158.64,3.78,can be helpful for you so what is
160.379,3.901,predictive analysis now predict analysis
162.42,4.08,is a branch of data analytics that
164.28,3.9,utilizes historical data statistical
166.5,3.42,algorithms and machine learning
168.18,3.66,techniques to make predictions and
169.92,3.599,forecast future outcomes it involves
171.84,4.02,extracting valuable insights from large
173.519,4.141,data sets to identify patterns friends
175.86,4.44,and relationships that can be used to
177.66,4.38,anticipate future events or Behavior now
180.3,3.6,for example in the context of travel
182.04,3.6,Predictive Analytics can be used to
183.9,4.14,analyze historical traffic patterns
185.64,4.26,whether data and other related factors
188.04,4.38,to estimate the likelihood of congestion
189.9,4.44,accidents or other delays along a
192.42,3.599,planned route now this information can
194.34,3.479,then be used to adjust travel plans
196.019,3.601,choose alternative routes or make
197.819,4.381,informed decisions to mitigate the
199.62,4.5,impact of potential disruptions now why
202.2,3.78,Predictive Analytics is important now
204.12,3.3,Predictive Analytics has emerged as a
205.98,2.94,vital tool in today's data-driven
207.42,3.539,landscape revolutionizing the way
208.92,3.599,organizations operate and make decisions
210.959,3.241,so here are the key reasons why
212.519,3.901,Predictive Analytics is of Paramount
214.2,4.08,importance first one is anticipating the
216.42,3.959,future outcomes now Predictive Analytics
218.28,3.78,empowers organizations to Pure into the
220.379,3.78,future with a higher level of certainty
222.06,4.44,by analyzing historical and real-time
224.159,4.381,data identifying patterns and applying
226.5,3.659,Advanced algorithms productive analytics
228.54,3.54,enables accurate predictions and
230.159,3.781,forecasts this foresight helps
232.08,4.019,organizations make proactive and
233.94,4.56,informed decisions mitigating any sort
236.099,4.681,of risk optimizing operation and seizing
238.5,4.26,the opportunities strategic decision
240.78,3.78,making comparative analytics equipped
242.76,4.199,decision makers with valuable insights
244.56,4.739,and objective evidence it enables them
246.959,4.801,to move Beyond instincts and subjective
249.299,3.901,judgment relying instead on data driven
251.76,3.0,predictions with a comprehensive
253.2,3.539,understanding of the likely outcomes of
254.76,3.719,various choices organizations can chart
256.739,3.96,a strategic course that maximizes
258.479,4.621,profitability efficiency customer
260.699,4.141,satisfaction and overall success and
263.1,3.539,finally customer understanding and
264.84,3.48,personalization in today's hyper
266.639,3.541,competitive market understanding
268.32,3.48,customers is key to success right so
270.18,3.72,operative analytics help organization
271.8,4.08,gain a deeper understanding of customer
273.9,4.2,Behavior their preferences and their
275.88,4.08,overall needs by analyzing vast amounts
278.1,3.78,of customer data organizations can
279.96,3.48,segment Their audience identify buying
281.88,3.66,patterns and offer personalized
283.44,4.979,experiences products and other services
285.54,4.68,this enhances customer satisfaction and
288.419,3.78,ultimately drives Revenue growth for the
290.22,3.479,organizations so moving ahead let us
292.199,3.661,discuss how does Predictive Analytics
293.699,3.901,work so firstly data scientists or data
295.86,3.059,analysts Define the problem now the
297.6,2.879,journey of Predictive Analytics begin
298.919,3.06,with clearly defining the problem at
300.479,3.901,hand whether it's fraud detection
301.979,4.381,inventory optimization or predicting
304.38,3.599,potential flood levels a well-defined
306.36,2.82,problem statement helps determine the
307.979,3.241,appropriate productive analytics
309.18,4.14,approach to employee now once you define
311.22,3.96,a problem it is important to acquire and
313.32,3.48,organize data properly now we all know
315.18,3.48,data is the live blood of Predictive
316.8,3.48,Analytics organizations may have vast
318.66,3.42,amounts of historical data or
320.28,3.54,continually streaming data from various
322.08,3.24,sources like customer interactions so
323.82,3.06,the first step is to identify and
325.32,3.84,acquire the relevant data and then
326.88,4.44,organize it in a central repository such
329.16,4.259,as a data warehouse or a bigquery to
331.32,3.96,frustrate efficient data processing now
333.419,4.321,after that you need to pre-process data
335.28,4.56,now raw data is rarely is an ideal state
337.74,3.84,for analysis right so before developing
339.84,3.66,predictive models data needs to be
341.58,3.6,pre-processed properly this involves
343.5,3.9,cleaning the data to remove any kind of
345.18,4.5,anomalies handling missing data points
347.4,4.139,and addressing extreme outliers that
349.68,3.78,could be caused by errors and input or
351.539,4.021,measurements pre-processing ensures that
353.46,4.799,the data is of high quality and ready
355.56,4.44,for model development next you have to
358.259,3.541,develop predictive models now what I
360.0,4.139,mean by that data scientists or data
361.8,4.14,analysts leverage a range of tools or
364.139,3.661,techniques to develop predictive models
365.94,3.479,based on the problem statement and the
367.8,3.839,nature of the data set now machine
369.419,5.041,learning algorithms regression models
371.639,4.56,decision trees neural networks are much
374.46,3.9,more among the common used approaches
376.199,4.021,for this these models are trained on the
378.36,4.26,prepared data to identify correlations
380.22,4.919,and patterns that can be used for making
382.62,4.859,predictions and finally validate and
385.139,3.961,deploy results now model validation is a
387.479,3.601,critical step to access the accuracy and
389.1,3.3,reliability of predictions data
391.08,2.58,scientists rigorously evaluate the
392.4,3.72,model's performance against known
393.66,4.2,outcomes or test data sets if necessary
396.12,3.78,adjustments are made to improve the
397.86,3.959,morals accuracy once the model achieve
399.9,3.419,satisfactory results it can be deployed
401.819,3.081,to deliver predictions to stakeholders
403.319,4.38,this can be done through applications
404.9,4.6,websites or data dashboards making the
407.699,3.901,insights easily accessible to decision
409.5,4.5,makers so by following all these steps
411.6,3.84,data scientists or data analyst can
414.0,3.66,create robust predictive analytic
415.44,3.9,Frameworks that Empower organizations to
417.66,3.599,make data driven decisions optimize
419.34,3.66,operations and gain a competitive
421.259,3.841,advantage in their respective domains
423.0,4.02,now we have talked about data models a
425.1,3.9,lot previously right so what exactly are
427.02,4.32,data models and why we need to use data
429.0,4.139,models in Predictive Analytics now data
431.34,3.96,models are user Predictive Analytics for
433.139,4.321,several reasons firstly understanding
435.3,3.36,data relationships now data models help
437.46,3.0,in understanding the relationship
438.66,4.02,between different variables and entities
440.46,3.959,in a data sets by defining the structure
442.68,3.9,and connections between data elements
444.419,4.381,models provide a clear representation of
446.58,4.14,how different factors relate to each
448.8,3.6,other this understanding is crucial for
450.72,4.02,developing accurate predictive models
452.4,3.78,secondly feature selection operative
454.74,3.239,analytics software involves selecting
456.18,3.72,the most relevant features or variables
457.979,4.021,that have a significant impact on the
459.9,3.6,outcome being predicted right so data
462.0,3.12,models help in identifying these
463.5,3.9,relevant features by analyzing their
465.12,4.139,relationships dependencies or any sort
467.4,3.72,of core relationships with the target
469.259,3.78,variable so this helps in eliminating
471.12,4.019,unnecessary or irrelevant features
473.039,4.201,reducing noise and improving the
475.139,4.321,accuracy of a predictive model thirdly
477.24,3.72,data preparation and transformation now
479.46,3.0,before applying Predictive Analytics
480.96,3.6,techniques data often needs to be
482.46,3.959,pre-processed transformed and cleaned
484.56,3.78,data models provide a blueprint for
486.419,4.56,these data preparation steps they Define
488.34,5.16,the structure and format of data specify
490.979,4.201,data types handle missing values and
493.5,4.199,establish rules for data normalization
495.18,4.38,or scaling data models ensure that data
497.699,3.601,is in a suitable form for analysis which
499.56,3.96,is essential for accurate predictions
501.3,3.78,next algorithm selection now different
503.52,3.239,predictive analytic algorithms have
505.08,3.959,specific requirements and assumptions
506.759,5.22,about the structure and format of data
509.039,4.68,so choosing a right algorithm is must so
511.979,3.36,data models provide insights into the
513.719,4.2,characteristics of the data such as its
515.339,3.961,distribution scale relationships which
517.919,3.781,can guide the selection of appropriate
519.3,3.78,algorithms for example linear regression
521.7,3.24,assumes a linear relationship between
523.08,4.02,variables while decision trees handle
524.94,3.899,categorical variables well data models
527.1,3.419,help in align these data with the
528.839,4.081,algorithms requirement as per the need
530.519,4.32,next interpretability and transparency
532.92,3.479,data models provide a visual
534.839,3.601,representation of data relationships
536.399,3.961,making them easier to understand and
538.44,3.6,interpret this is essentially important
540.36,2.94,for business stakeholders who need to
542.04,3.299,complement the underlying factors
543.3,3.599,driving predictions a well-defined data
545.339,3.541,model allows stakeholders to validate
546.899,3.781,the model's assumptions evaluate the
548.88,3.48,impact of different variables or
550.68,3.599,outcomes and gain insights into the
552.36,3.84,decision making process and finally
554.279,3.541,iterative development and Improvement
556.2,4.199,Predictive Analytics is often an
557.82,5.28,iterative process where models are built
560.399,4.56,evaluated and refile multiple times it
563.1,4.14,facilitates this hydrating development
564.959,3.781,framework by providing and organizing
567.24,3.539,the documenting the data analysis
568.74,3.96,process they enable trying changes
570.779,4.081,documenting assumptions and storing
572.7,4.5,metadata related to data Transformations
574.86,4.62,and feature engineering so data models
577.2,3.78,help building upon various works and
579.48,3.84,continuously improving the productive
580.98,4.02,models so let us now discuss some of the
583.32,3.66,various types of productive analytical
585.0,3.66,models that you can use creative
586.98,3.359,analytics models are used to analyze
588.66,3.9,historical data and make predictions
590.339,3.781,about future events or outcomes so there
592.56,3.6,are several types of relative analytical
594.12,3.96,models including classification model
596.16,3.78,now classification models are used to
598.08,4.319,predict categorical outcomes or group
599.94,4.5,data into predefined classes now example
602.399,4.5,include logistic regression decision
604.44,4.44,trees random Forest support Vector
606.899,4.141,machines and others next we have
608.88,3.66,regression models regression models are
611.04,2.88,used to predict a continuous outcome
612.54,3.359,variable based on one or more
613.92,4.02,independent variables and examples for
615.899,3.901,this include linear regression multiple
617.94,4.62,regression and polynomial regression
619.8,4.08,third we have Western model now
622.56,3.36,clustering models are used to group
623.88,4.26,similar data points together based on
625.92,3.9,their characteristics or patterns and
628.14,3.54,examples of clustering models include
629.82,4.56,k-means clustering hierarchical
631.68,4.86,clustering and much more next we have
634.38,3.78,time series model now time series models
636.54,3.12,are used to predict future values based
638.16,3.9,on patterns and historical time
639.66,4.44,dependent data now examples include Auto
642.06,4.68,regressive integrated moving average or
644.1,5.64,in short Ari ma model and exponential
646.74,4.68,smoothing models and finally neural
649.74,3.719,network models now these are some of the
651.42,4.32,advanced kind of operative analytical
653.459,4.021,models that you can use such as feed
655.74,4.68,forward neural networks or recurrent
657.48,4.62,neural networks RN are CNN are used to
660.42,3.599,predict complex data patterns and
662.1,3.419,relationships in a data the particularly
664.019,3.601,effective for tasks like image
665.519,4.201,recognitions natural language processing
667.62,4.38,and sequence predictions so these are
669.72,4.739,some of the main types of predictive
672.0,4.14,analytical models that you can use but
674.459,3.661,having all that said where we can use a
676.14,3.54,Predictive Analytics in real life so let
678.12,3.36,us now discuss some of the real life use
679.68,4.62,cases of Predictive Analytics which you
681.48,5.099,can use in a day-to-day basis so firstly
684.3,4.08,financial analysis or banking sectors
686.579,4.141,now productive analytics is used for
688.38,4.68,credit scoring fraud detection risk
690.72,4.2,assessment and investment analysis it
693.06,3.719,helps financial institutions main data
694.92,4.02,demand decisions detect suspicious
696.779,4.62,activities and identify potential Market
698.94,4.079,prints now Predictive Analytics is also
701.399,3.481,extensively used in sales and marketing
703.019,3.781,as well now Predictive Analytics plays a
704.88,4.019,crucial roles in sales and marketing by
706.8,4.02,providing invaluable insights and help
708.899,4.321,organizations make data driven decisions
710.82,4.92,threat Dev analytics model analyze
713.22,4.619,historical sales data market trends
715.74,4.14,customer behavior and external factors
