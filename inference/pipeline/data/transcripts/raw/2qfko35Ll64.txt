second,duration,transcript
0.78,5.1,hello guys so in this video we will
3.3,5.94,discuss about databases
5.88,5.82,and in databases we will discuss about a
9.24,4.68,relational and non or relational
11.7,5.04,databases
13.92,5.52,so in what is the relational databases
16.74,5.64,basically it consists of tables many
19.44,6.9,tables and uh and each table we have
22.38,6.0,rows which are Horizon horizontal and we
26.34,5.04,have vertical change which is called as
28.38,7.14,columns uh we might have seen the CSV
31.38,7.98,format dot PSP format file which we can
35.52,7.14,see in Excel and when we open that we
39.36,7.199,see that there are a tabular format data
42.66,6.84,and each cell has some value in it could
46.559,6.961,be numeric it could be some string
49.5,6.239,format data in each of the cell but in
53.52,5.4,whole horizontal if we see the
55.739,6.541,horizontal uh series of those cells are
58.92,5.4,known as rows and in columns we know
62.28,5.4,that it is the vertical series of the
64.32,6.24,cells so I think it is uh we already
67.68,5.46,know what is PSP format and what is the
70.56,6.3,table but in relational details we have
73.14,6.479,multiple tables so it can have 10 tables
76.86,4.439,or 20 tables like that depending on your
79.619,4.86,requirement
81.299,5.701,then uh before creating any database we
84.479,4.801,need to define the schema which is a
87.0,4.619,logical design of the database
89.28,3.96,so for defining the schema we need to
91.619,4.921,Define what would be the name of the
93.24,6.18,columns in each of the tables we have
96.54,6.96,so say we have 10 tables and each table
99.42,7.32,have maybe 50 200 uh columns we need to
103.5,5.88,Define each column names each of the
106.74,4.98,tables we need to define the data types
109.38,4.919,whether it is numeric uh whether it is
111.72,5.7,date time variable whether it is a
114.299,5.701,string data what kind of data format it
117.42,4.08,is you need to define the data type
120.0,4.92,depending
121.5,6.24,on the database which we are using and
124.92,6.059,so basically this is a logical design uh
127.74,4.92,and we need to plan it before we create
130.979,5.221,the database
132.66,6.299,we can also change it uh but uh it's
136.2,6.3,good to decide it before you create a
138.959,7.86,database so that uh there is nothing
142.5,6.239,wrong happens in future uh now uh let us
146.819,4.56,see what are the examples of relational
148.739,6.801,database now examples of relational
151.379,7.021,database is the myth equal Oracle
155.54,5.08,postgres and sqlite
158.4,4.8,these are some of the examples of the
160.62,4.979,databases which we have so if you create
163.2,5.399,the mySQL database it will have multiple
165.599,5.581,tables each table will have its own name
168.599,5.28,and inside each table you will have
171.18,5.1,multiple rows and multiple columns
173.879,3.601,so each of the columns will have its own
176.28,4.5,name again
177.48,6.0,uh so a table you can consider it as
180.78,4.94,some kind of tabular format dot CSV
183.48,6.0,format kind of data
185.72,5.739,now my SQL if you can talk about MySQL
189.48,5.16,it is an open source
191.459,5.28,first first of all it is free it has
194.64,4.76,some positive negatives each of the data
196.739,6.961,base has its own positive and negatives
199.4,6.94,and might equal uh you can you can have
203.7,7.74,null values you can have missing values
206.34,8.58,where you have got any kind of uh thing
211.44,6.659,uh but noise people does not support uh
214.92,5.819,data partitioning and accessible
218.099,4.621,we we know about the data partitioning
220.739,4.621,uh when we are partitioning the data in
222.72,4.799,the database we do it using some kind of
225.36,4.32,ID
227.519,5.041,and what does it do it it helps in
229.68,4.139,making the query faster in the database
232.56,3.0,tables
233.819,4.741,okay
235.56,6.899,okay now if you are coming to Oracle uh
238.56,7.44,it is not an open source and not a free
242.459,5.28,software uh it does not support null
246.0,5.7,values
247.739,5.521,and data partitioning and XML support is
251.7,3.72,available in it
253.26,5.24,so this is a positive point in Oracle
255.42,7.8,basically Oracle will be used for large
258.5,7.78,uh data sets when we have a large data
263.22,5.22,Enterprise kind of data we have then we
266.28,4.8,need Oracle
268.44,5.88,now let us uh
271.08,5.1,move to non-relational database
274.32,5.22,the basic difference between a
276.18,6.54,relational and non-relational database
279.54,5.82,is the that in it is not a traveler
282.72,6.0,format relational was a developer format
285.36,6.6,data right now coming to non-relational
288.72,6.0,it is not a tablet format
291.96,5.64,and we do not have a well-defined schema
294.72,6.3,whereas when the relational database uh
297.6,6.12,we did have a well-defined schema
301.02,5.58,there we have multiple tables
303.72,5.759,um in the database in one database here
306.6,4.02,we have a table and it is called as the
309.479,5.521,collection
310.62,6.54,a row is here known as document is one
315.0,2.699,observation
317.16,3.62,um
317.699,6.421,and column is kind of called as field
320.78,5.08,which columns we are talking of
324.12,4.079,right
325.86,5.279,basically non-relational databases will
328.199,4.801,be used for some kind of text Data audio
331.139,3.78,video
333.0,4.62,mostly some of the data which is coming
334.919,5.161,from social media kind of data
337.62,5.22,which is in the format of text audio
340.08,5.179,video kind of data right
342.84,2.419,so
345.72,6.539,we do use a relational and
348.24,6.78,non-relational in combinations and uh if
352.259,5.22,you have a very specific uh use case
355.02,6.36,where you have only text you might have
357.479,7.321,only might be using only one uh one type
361.38,7.02,of non-relational database and but when
364.8,6.98,we talk about come Enterprise level data
368.4,6.54,there you might have different kinds of
371.78,4.72,databases working together in the whole
374.94,4.38,system design
376.5,5.58,I will talk about all those uh in the
379.32,5.52,future videos the how to uh
382.08,6.959,how to design a complete system for uh
384.84,8.1,or maybe uh e-commerce or
389.039,6.421,traveling website or anything like that
392.94,4.74,so in that for that purpose you must be
395.46,4.019,knowing which database is important and
397.68,4.92,how these are being connected different
399.479,8.541,services are talking to each other and
402.6,5.42,which database is kept in which service
408.6,6.12,okay now let us see some of the
412.5,5.1,examples uh
414.72,6.18,so here we will talk about uh types of
417.6,5.52,non-relational databases so basically
420.9,5.519,broadly if you categorize non-relational
423.12,6.56,databases there are many more but these
426.419,7.861,are the most broadly classified
429.68,8.079,key value document based and graph paste
434.28,6.359,white column based when you talk of key
437.759,6.141,value based here you have a key is from
440.639,6.301,ID link to the value we want to store
443.9,5.019,value will be something which is with
446.94,3.479,the information which we need for a
448.919,4.4,corresponding ID
450.419,2.9,foreign
455.419,5.68,there are other also
458.46,6.9,it is also used when you want to Cache
461.099,6.6,the data to make the make the
465.36,3.6,communication faster in the network in
467.699,5.521,the data flow
468.96,7.139,now uh now coming to the document paste
473.22,7.94,the stored it is stored data similar to
476.099,8.761,the Json objects okay and it is a
481.16,6.939,TVs its example is mongodb
484.86,7.02,it is mostly used when kind of network
488.099,7.621,data uh like iot data or something like
491.88,8.52,that now you have graph based data
495.72,6.479,there's two data in nodes and edges
500.4,3.919,it has some application in
502.199,6.18,Telecommunications
504.319,5.621,uh neo4j is the database which we can
508.379,7.28,use
509.94,5.719,here white column based Dynamic columns
524.72,3.78,one of the examples
529.08,7.5,now coming to mongodb
532.92,7.02,where mongodb can be used is the example
536.58,7.8,of mongodb then iot platform requires 4
539.94,8.399,for data uh from many devices okay so as
544.38,5.82,I said that the company which is based
548.339,4.801,on iot
550.2,5.16,Internet of Things uh the smart things
553.14,4.08,which have been connected together it's
555.36,5.039,a network of smart things which are
557.22,5.54,connected it could be a home it could be
560.399,6.901,a office or it could be anything
562.76,7.54,wherever we have this kind of data uh
567.3,4.68,this data can be stored in in a database
570.3,4.08,similar to
571.98,5.46,um similar to mongodb
574.38,5.579,and it handles data from different types
577.44,5.82,of devices
579.959,7.32,and the database and the data structure
583.26,8.22,is Json Json based document database
587.279,6.721,it pulls the data using single index
591.48,5.16,or multiple index which is device ID
594.0,5.1,with location ID
596.64,4.98,a record for a particular device in
599.1,6.48,different rotations are easily accessed
601.62,6.48,okay so whenever you have a use case
605.58,5.16,similar to like you want to find the
608.1,4.919,rewards for a particular device in in
610.74,4.44,some in different locations for a
613.019,5.161,particular device you want to find all
615.18,5.82,the records and different locations you
618.18,5.219,can easily access using mongodb if you
621.0,4.62,use any any other database you might be
623.399,5.0,able to store the data which you have in
625.62,5.58,iot but it could be very difficult to
628.399,4.421,fetch the data or also it would be very
631.2,3.0,difficult to store the data in that
632.82,4.5,format
634.2,5.52,okay basically uh we would prefer a
637.32,3.959,mongodb because it is using a Json based
639.72,4.5,document database
641.279,4.981,okay now let us coming to neo4j when you
644.22,4.679,will be using this kind of database uh
646.26,5.46,one example would be wherever you have a
648.899,6.0,videos and maybe you can consider as a
651.72,5.28,educational video tutorial but portal uh
654.899,5.461,the data which you collect uh get it
657.0,5.64,from these kind of websites the portals
660.36,5.76,that can be stored in a new code
662.64,6.84,and why why what is the positive point
666.12,6.42,in this new approach is that uh whenever
669.48,6.359,it is serving uh to the clients or to
672.54,6.419,the users the videos which a website has
675.839,5.041,so the users can move from one lesson to
678.959,4.861,the another because then there is one
680.88,4.62,chapter and it has 10 lessons so user
683.82,6.9,can move from one lesson to the other
685.5,7.68,very easily if you have a neo4j database
690.72,6.359,in the back end
693.18,6.96,okay now we talk about elasticsearch and
697.079,4.041,fourth grade equal again it is a no
700.14,3.18,music
701.12,4.06,non-relational database
703.32,5.519,basically these are kind of search
705.18,6.12,engines and uh it allows the users to
708.839,5.161,search for menu items and restaurants
711.3,5.64,this is one of the example so whenever
714.0,5.1,you see a website which is the which is
716.94,5.339,allowing the user to search for menu
719.1,5.16,items different items food items on
722.279,6.781,different restaurants who are delivering
724.26,6.9,the pro food items then we can use uh
729.06,5.04,elasticsearch in the back end for
731.16,5.94,storing the data for the food items we
734.1,6.479,have and the restaurant and their uh
737.1,5.4,each of the food catalogs they have
740.579,3.721,what is what happens is the user is
742.5,2.94,searching for something in the website
744.3,2.4,of that
745.44,4.86,oh
746.7,4.68,and a user is putting some text on the
750.3,3.84,search bar
751.38,5.22,in the website lookbook
754.14,5.04,what what it will be delivering is the
756.6,6.9,we'll be delivering all the results in
759.18,7.14,the recommended uh format so it will do
763.5,5.279,recommend based on the text search
766.32,4.62,uh the thing is why is the elastic
768.779,3.601,search because when you're putting the
770.94,4.139,text in the third
772.38,6.72,it will be delivering the result to the
775.079,7.2,user in no seconds so it is very fast
779.1,6.239,if you using some other database it will
782.279,5.461,take uh some some time to deliver it to
785.339,5.821,the user because user is looking at some
787.74,5.64,some and and the database is in some
791.16,3.66,other place and it is far it is
793.38,4.86,communicating through wireless
794.82,7.62,communication so what happens is when
798.24,7.52,the user is sending uh its query on the
802.44,6.56,database of elastic research it will be
805.76,6.94,it will be responding with the results
809.0,5.94,recommended results very easily in no
812.7,2.24,time
815.16,6.6,okay now we will talk about the asset
818.82,4.139,properties of dbms database management
821.76,5.04,system
822.959,6.541,basically uh before talking of asset
826.8,5.099,properties of dbms we will first talk
829.5,5.339,about what is the transaction basically
831.899,5.88,transaction is the group of operations
834.839,7.101,and operations could be any read and
837.779,4.161,write for different variables
849.42,6.359,so what do you mean by
851.82,6.9,City okay by atomic City means that
855.779,5.641,whenever there is a transaction some
858.72,4.32,some may be some variable is red some
861.42,4.62,other variable is red
863.04,6.12,uh some transaction is happening
866.04,6.239,either it will get completed or it will
869.16,6.419,not complete at all so it it won't be
872.279,6.3,like that it happens and it stops in the
875.579,5.461,middle so it is either completed or not
878.579,5.82,complete it is like that so A is for
881.04,6.06,like that t for consistency
884.399,5.221,so so whenever the transaction is
887.1,5.76,happening before and after the net value
889.62,6.06,Remains the Same so it won't be changing
892.86,5.099,if it is changing that means the our
895.68,4.04,database has become inconsistent there
897.959,5.341,is something wrong happened
899.72,7.78,uh maybe something is someone is reading
903.3,6.539,the data before it is being written so
907.5,4.98,we need to make sure the database is
909.839,4.56,such that that it remains consistent at
912.48,4.859,all the times
914.399,4.201,what is the uh isolation isolation is
917.339,2.821,when we have
918.6,3.299,different transactions which are
920.16,5.88,happening in parallel
921.899,6.421,they will happen in parallel without any
926.04,5.4,interference without any interference
928.32,6.54,okay that should also happen as a
931.44,4.98,property in dbms
934.86,4.38,now
936.42,6.419,he is for durability what does it mean
939.24,5.219,after some transaction is successful all
942.839,5.94,the changes which has happened in that
944.459,7.56,transition which will remain saved okay
948.779,8.161,now that these asset properties of dbms
952.019,7.68,is not present in all the databases some
956.94,6.54,database do have
959.699,5.88,asset properties some do not have so we
963.48,3.0,need to make sure that what kind of data
965.579,4.081,we have
966.48,7.32,if it is kind of mostly in the real-time
969.66,6.72,data uh and in the monetary transactions
973.8,5.24,it is very important that we should have
976.38,5.22,asset properties to be fulfilled
979.04,5.88,otherwise there will be some something
981.6,6.78,wrong happened and the database and
984.92,5.859,whatever the analysis you do will not be
988.38,4.519,good either in the present or in the
990.779,2.12,future
993.899,5.421,now we will talk of the cap theorem it
996.3,6.24,is it is the consistency
999.32,5.019,availability and what it can now the
1002.54,4.62,acid properties which we discussed
1004.339,6.42,earlier it is it was for the transaction
1007.16,5.099,to focus the focus point is when we
1010.759,3.721,whenever we are talking of passive
1012.259,4.44,properties uh please remember that we
1014.48,4.859,are talking about the transactions so
1016.699,5.76,for each of the atomicity consistency
1019.339,4.801,isolation durability it is it is we are
1022.459,4.081,talking of transaction and transaction
1024.14,5.039,is actually a group of operations and
1026.54,5.58,where operations means the read and
1029.179,4.801,write for different uh variables now
1032.12,4.74,when whenever we are talking of the cap
1033.98,5.4,theorem uh we need to make sure that we
1036.86,5.339,are not talking of the transactions here
1039.38,6.0,we are talking of the servers or cluster
1042.199,4.74,we have which are storing the data so
1045.38,5.76,consistency what does it means
1046.939,7.201,consistency or not consistency of data
1051.14,5.539,Remains the Same among the machines
1054.14,5.46,so if you want to make that consistency
1056.679,5.981,what we do any data right on the master
1059.6,5.52,or the primary machine should also
1062.66,5.04,instantly be replicated on the slave
1065.12,4.799,over the secondary machine before the
1067.7,5.82,right is declared successful
1069.919,6.801,so if we have a cluster in the cluster
1073.52,3.2,we have multiple muscles
1083.98,5.26,same thing so we need to make sure
1087.679,4.581,whenever we are writing on the master
1089.24,6.0,that should also be replicated
1092.26,5.279,instantaneously on the screen also
1095.24,5.4,before the right is declared in Texas
1097.539,5.921,otherwise the data is not consistent
1100.64,5.159,among the machines and if the data is
1103.46,4.68,not consistent among the machines there
1105.799,4.26,might be some breed is happening from
1108.14,4.2,some machine where the data is not
1110.059,5.581,consistent from the other machine then
1112.34,6.24,there will be an issue so uh we we
1115.64,6.419,should always make it consistent across
1118.58,6.719,the machines availability data is
1122.059,5.821,available to all the clients machine all
1125.299,6.021,the time that means whenever the client
1127.88,7.38,is communicating to the database
1131.32,4.96,uh and the data is in the servers right
1135.26,4.799,so
1136.28,7.98,all the cluster whatever we have the
1140.059,7.5,cluster should be available 24 7.
1144.26,5.1,and it shouldn't be down so it is not
1147.559,5.041,like that one of the machine goes down
1149.36,6.62,there and it is there is some breakdown
1152.6,3.38,and it is not available
1162.039,5.981,there are some issues with the server or
1165.32,6.42,cluster so that that is again a
1168.02,7.44,liability of the cluster or server
1171.74,6.059,uh now for detail tolerance uh cluster
1175.46,4.62,must continue to work despite any
1177.799,4.681,Communications breakdown
1180.08,6.06,so again it is the similar kind of thing
1182.48,5.4,in the Gap theorem we are almost we are
1186.14,4.32,always talking about the cluster of
1187.88,6.06,server it uh whatever the machines we
1190.46,6.3,have in the cluster that should be
1193.94,5.88,kept in such a way that whenever there
1196.76,5.52,is a read from the client side there
1199.82,5.46,shouldn't be any issues also there
1202.28,5.82,should be a consistency across of the
1205.28,4.86,data across all the machines and there
1208.1,4.439,should be a partition tolerance as well
1210.14,4.919,that means the cluster must continue to
1212.539,6.061,work despite any any Communications
1215.059,7.74,breakdown between any of the machines
1218.6,6.54,so whenever we talk of asset properties
1222.799,4.561,be careful that we are talking of the
1225.14,5.7,transactions because here also we have
1227.36,5.939,consistently and in the capital also we
1230.84,4.26,have consistency but here in the Gap
1233.299,4.681,theorem we are talking about the servers
1235.1,5.04,or the machines clusters
1237.98,4.38,but in the asset properties we are
1240.14,5.22,talking of the transactions in the next
1242.36,5.4,video I will try to create uh more
1245.36,4.92,videos on
1247.76,3.48,something related to databases in more
1250.28,4.34,detail
1251.24,3.38,thanks for watching this video
