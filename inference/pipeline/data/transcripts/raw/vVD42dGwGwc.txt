0.0,3.81,moving on from the last video the next
1.77,3.9,topic is number theory number theory is
3.81,3.6,simply the study of integers which seems
5.67,4.53,easy and even unnecessary
7.41,6.12,I mean integers are just 0 1 to negative
10.2,5.309,10 negative 49 and so on no decimals or
13.53,4.44,anything like that but it's far from
15.509,3.901,easy 90% of what I research for this
17.97,3.66,video just couldn't be thrown in because
19.41,3.15,it was really advanced but one big
21.63,2.909,application of this field is
22.56,3.539,cryptography whenever you buy something
24.539,3.541,online or input your password into a
26.099,4.291,website you can think number theory for
28.08,3.929,helping keep those secure most of us
30.39,3.45,learned many basic concepts of number
32.009,4.291,theory starting in elementary school for
33.84,4.739,example you know 28 is divisible by 7
36.3,6.12,and why is that because you can multiply
38.579,5.311,7 by another integer to get 28 you also
42.42,4.83,know that the greatest common factor of
43.89,5.09,let's say 24 and 40 is 8 because 8 is
47.25,5.37,the biggest number that goes into both
48.98,7.809,but what if you were asked if 24 times 9
52.62,5.64,plus 40 times 7 is divisible by 8 well
56.789,4.2,this is really saying is there some
58.26,4.65,integer that I can multiply by 8 to get
60.989,4.021,that number and you should be able to
62.91,4.44,recognize that if you divide both sides
65.01,5.07,by 8 which is the same as dividing each
67.35,5.519,term by 8 you can cancel certain terms
70.08,5.429,like the 24 and the 8 and the 40 and the
72.869,5.401,8 leaving integers on top and ones on
75.509,5.131,the bottom and this definitely leads to
78.27,4.139,an integer in our case at 62 but we
80.64,3.119,really didn't care about that we just
82.409,3.541,wanted to find out if this side was
83.759,5.82,divisible by 8 and now we know that it
85.95,6.45,is why that worked is because the 24 and
89.579,4.68,40 were both divisible by 8 it did not
92.4,5.67,matter what these two numbers were in
94.259,6.511,fact 24 times any integer plus 40 times
98.07,5.97,any other integer is always divisible by
100.77,5.639,8 and now you can see why this is a
104.04,6.03,linear combination of two numbers in
106.409,5.131,this case it's 24 and 40 now here's
110.07,3.72,something you probably don't know yet
111.54,5.52,what is the smallest positive integer
113.79,5.82,you can get from this if we set em to
117.06,6.089,negative 1 and end to 1 then do the
119.61,6.24,addition we get 16 but if we set em to 2
123.149,4.92,and end to negative 1 we get 8 which is
125.85,5.4,our smallest one now so 16 won't be our
128.069,5.5,answer maybe we set em to 5 and n 2
131.25,4.299,negative 3 then we get 0
133.569,4.56,but we are only looking for the smallest
135.549,5.491,positive integer therefore zero and
138.129,4.86,negatives don't count now the answer to
141.04,4.5,this is actually 8 you won't find
142.989,4.62,anything smaller than that the smallest
145.54,3.929,positive integer will actually always be
147.609,3.0,the greatest common factor of the two
149.469,3.75,numbers you are doing the linear
150.609,5.641,combination of remember that for this
153.219,5.401,next puzzle let's say we have an
156.25,4.439,infinite amount of rulers half of them
158.62,4.349,measure 7 centimeters and the other half
160.689,4.47,measure 5 centimeters yes I know it's a
162.969,3.72,small length but just go with it there
165.159,4.05,are no markings on them and we cannot
166.689,4.5,estimate anything like what 1/2 or 1/4
169.209,3.571,of the length is we only know that they
171.189,4.83,measure 7 and five centimeters
172.78,5.25,respectively the question is can we
176.019,4.741,perfectly measure a distance of 2
178.03,4.98,centimeters now this should be pretty
180.76,4.649,easy you lay down the seven centimeter
183.01,4.289,ruler then the five on top of that with
185.409,3.81,their ends at the same point the
187.299,3.84,distance from the beginning of the seven
189.219,5.011,to the beginning of the five would
191.139,5.25,measure two centimeters all we did was
194.23,5.63,take the seven centimeter ruler subtract
196.389,6.201,the 5 centimeter one and we get two
199.86,5.58,the next question is could we measure 3
202.59,4.5,centimeters perfectly after a little
205.44,5.19,thought you should see we can lay down
207.09,6.15,to 5 centimeter rulers and then a 7 on
210.63,4.26,top of that with the ends lined up the
213.24,4.02,distance from the beginning of the first
214.89,6.12,5 to the beginning of the 7 would then
217.26,6.6,be 3 centimeters again the formula B 2
221.01,6.69,of the 5 centimeter rulers minus one of
223.86,5.97,the sevens gives us 3 now the generic
227.7,4.29,question is can we measure any integer
229.83,4.26,lengths could we measure 71 centimeters
231.99,4.38,or what if instead we had an
234.09,4.05,eighty-seven centimeter ruler and a 39
236.37,5.13,centimeter ruler what can we measure
238.14,4.95,that well in our example we know we can
241.5,5.61,achieve a measure of three centimeters
243.09,6.36,by two 5s - a seven that means if you
247.11,5.34,want to achieve 6 centimeters we can
249.45,5.64,just multiply both sides by 2 if we
252.45,5.22,distribute that 2 we see that 4 of the 5
255.09,4.89,centimeter rulers - two of the seven
257.67,4.8,centimeter ones gives us exactly 6
259.98,5.37,centimeters and we can use this to get
262.47,4.38,any multiple of three remember I said
265.35,3.9,earlier that the smallest positive
266.85,4.56,integer you can achieve is the greatest
269.25,4.95,common factor of the two numbers which
271.41,6.24,in our case are the two ruler links the
274.2,4.86,greatest common factor of those is 1 so
277.65,4.019,we can achieve a measure of one
279.06,5.1,centimeter or any integer multiple of
281.669,4.791,that which basically means any positive
284.16,6.12,integer we want if we wanted to measure
286.46,6.07,833 centimeters we could and that's what
290.28,4.38,the solution to this is the smallest
292.53,4.53,measure you can make is the greatest
294.66,3.69,common factor of the ruler lengths then
297.06,4.95,you can also make a measure of any
298.35,6.48,positive integer multiple of that if our
302.01,5.04,ruler lengths are 91 centimeters and 26
304.83,5.31,centimeters the greatest common factor
307.05,8.4,is 13 so we can measure 13 centimeters
310.14,7.81,or 26 39 52 and any integer multiple 13
315.45,4.6,but nothing in between
317.95,3.36,yes this was a simple example of number
320.05,3.99,theory but I thought it was a good
321.31,4.32,easy-to-follow problem now if you want
324.04,3.9,an intro about this application of
325.63,4.05,cryptography the foundation for securing
327.94,4.23,our information is large prime numbers
329.68,5.31,it's actually very difficult even for
332.17,5.82,computers to factor a really big number
334.99,5.88,into two primes for example 13 is prime
337.99,5.97,and so is 19 multiply those together and
340.87,5.16,you get 247 if you handed that number to
343.96,3.87,someone it would not be so easy for them
346.03,4.74,to break it down into its two prime
347.83,4.5,factors to be fair this one and take too
350.77,3.24,long but do it with numbers with
352.33,3.12,hundreds of digits and even a
354.01,3.78,supercomputer can't do it in a
355.45,3.84,reasonable amount of time the fastest
357.79,3.48,algorithm we know of it's called the
359.29,3.69,general number field sieve but when you
361.27,5.16,get to several hundred digits this
362.98,4.62,algorithm becomes unfeasible so like I
366.43,3.09,talked about in the computer science
367.6,4.08,video if we wanted to transmit the
369.52,4.29,phrase hello we could turn that into a
371.68,3.99,prime number like by turning each letter
373.81,4.74,into whatever number place it is in the
375.67,5.76,alphabet H is the eighth letter E is the
378.55,5.46,fifth letter and so on then we just add
381.43,4.23,a small ending to make it prime then you
384.01,3.93,and your friend who you want to send
385.66,4.56,this message to could exchange a secret
387.94,4.77,key which is a really big prime number
390.22,4.71,as well when you want to transmit hello
392.71,3.81,you just multiply it by your secret key
394.93,4.02,and send that to your friend
396.52,4.44,if someone intercepts it they could not
398.95,3.99,decipher it if they knew they were
400.96,3.99,looking for two prime numbers that go
402.94,3.96,into this big number even with a
404.95,3.69,computer it would take a long time to
406.9,4.08,figure out at least if the numbers are
408.64,4.89,really big so they won't know what the
410.98,4.29,message actually says but your friend
413.53,4.62,would just divide by the secret key and
415.27,4.83,recover the message but unfortunately
418.15,3.45,there's a huge flaw with this if someone
420.1,3.51,intercepts your message which is your
421.6,4.47,secret key times your actual message
423.61,4.2,then they intercept another message
426.07,4.32,which would be your secret key times
427.81,4.95,another actual message they could easily
430.39,4.23,find your secret key because it would be
432.76,3.96,the greatest common factor of the two
434.62,4.43,numbers they intercept it and there are
436.72,4.68,ways to determine this very efficiently
439.05,3.88,now while researching this video and the
441.4,3.96,last one I was going through lectures
442.93,3.48,textbooks practice problems and more to
445.36,3.48,figure out what would be ideal to
446.41,3.72,include but 90% of what I came across
448.84,2.22,had me saying this would be too
450.13,2.73,difficult to accept
451.06,3.99,this will take too long they need more
452.86,3.75,background for this and so on so realize
455.05,3.3,this video and the last one don't really
456.61,4.14,do justice for these huge fields of
458.35,3.569,mathematics and computer science I did
460.75,2.79,talk more about number theory in the
461.919,3.0,computer science video such as with the
463.54,2.82,Euclid's algorithm and finding the
464.919,3.031,greatest common factor of two big
466.36,3.45,numbers so I'm not really going to go
467.95,3.03,into much more detail but I thought
469.81,2.34,these were just some fun examples
470.98,2.88,they're really highlight how different
472.15,3.72,math can be especially at a university
473.86,3.69,level compared to what you may think and
475.87,3.269,that's what I'm going to end this video
