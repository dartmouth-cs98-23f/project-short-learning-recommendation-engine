0.0,4.02,if you're newer to nosql databases and
2.52,4.7,want to learn more about what they are
4.02,3.2,this video is for you
7.859,4.141,welcome back to our Channel I'm Megan
9.66,4.62,from mongodb's developer relations team
12.0,4.74,here at mongodb we talk a lot about
14.28,4.86,nosql databases because that's what we
16.74,4.98,are but what does that even mean nosql
19.14,4.979,is technically an umbrella term for any
21.72,5.639,alternative system to traditional SQL
24.119,4.861,databases nosql databases use a data
27.359,3.42,model that has a different structure
28.98,4.5,than the rows and columns table
30.779,4.861,structure used with rdbms now within
33.48,4.919,nosql databases there are actually four
35.64,5.4,types document databases key value
38.399,4.741,stores column oriented databases and
41.04,3.839,graph databases let's talk about each of
43.14,4.079,these in a little more detail first up
44.879,5.281,we've got document databases a document
47.219,6.241,database like mongodb for example stores
50.16,5.579,data in a Json or bson format you can
53.46,4.32,access store and retrieve documents from
55.739,4.381,your database in a form that is much
57.78,4.259,closer to the data objects used in
60.12,4.079,applications this means that less
62.039,4.62,translation is required to use and
64.199,4.681,access data in an application document
66.659,4.261,databases are popular with developers
68.88,4.02,because they offer the flexibility to
70.92,3.9,rework their document structures as
72.9,5.46,needed to better suit their applications
74.82,6.18,in SQL databases however intervention by
78.36,4.38,database administrators may be required
81.0,4.08,to change the structure of a database
82.74,4.559,next we have key value stores and this
85.08,4.5,is the simplest type of nosql database
87.299,4.86,every element is stored as a key value
89.58,5.28,pair consisting of an attribute name or
92.159,5.401,the key and a value this database is
94.86,4.86,like an rdbms with two columns the
97.56,4.68,attribute name such as state and the
99.72,5.579,value such as Alaska third we have
102.24,5.58,column oriented databases while an rdbms
105.299,4.801,stores data in rows and reads it row by
107.82,4.619,row column oriented databases are
110.1,4.14,organized as a set of columns when you
112.439,3.96,want to run analytics on a small number
114.24,4.14,of columns in a database you can read
116.399,4.381,those columns directly without consuming
118.38,4.68,memory with unwanted data finally we
120.78,4.86,have graph databases a graph database
123.06,4.62,focuses on the relationship between data
125.64,4.44,elements each element is contained as an
127.68,4.199,node the connections between elements in
130.08,4.14,a database are called links or
131.879,4.681,relationships connections are first
134.22,4.98,class elements of the database stored
136.56,4.2,directly these databases are diverse in
139.2,4.02,their data formats and applications
140.76,4.979,furthermore systems store data in
143.22,4.32,different ways these differ from rdbms
145.739,3.601,in that they can be schema agnostic
147.54,4.02,which allows unstructured and
149.34,4.2,semi-structured data in a network to be
151.56,3.6,stored and processed this was just the
153.54,3.36,tip of the iceberg and we've got a whole
155.16,3.299,lot more where that came from in the
156.9,3.479,description below we're leaving a few
158.459,3.541,more links to other videos and articles
160.379,3.121,that you might find helpful if you're
