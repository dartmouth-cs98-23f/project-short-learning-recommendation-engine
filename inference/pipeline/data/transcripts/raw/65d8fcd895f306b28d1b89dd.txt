hello everybody and welcome to another
lecture on computer architecture
today i want to talk to you about
quantum computing
something that is well not state of the
art it is more like beyond state of the
art
it is into still in the development
phase so it's not even clear if it's
going to work
but let me try to explain to you what is
going on and why it would be phenomenal
if it really works
so the first thing i want to actually uh
i want to tell you what it is
actually based on what do we have
is um that
in a normal computer we have let's say
an and gate in which every bit
there it enters and it has the bit can
have two values it's either
one or it is zero and that is then
linked to a physical property so for
instance the zero is zero volts
and the one is five volts or maybe
uh the zero is that the capacitor is
charged
and uh one is that the capacitor is
empty or the other way around
whatever but with quantum computing
there is something
strange going on because the bits
that we put at the input cannot have
either one of the two values but it can
have two values
at the same time and that is something
very strange but that comes from
quantum mechanics so the idea is
that you have an object of physical
property that can have
various states so we can for instance
take here
the classic example is that you can have
here an electron spin
and as you know well maybe not but the
electron spin it can either rotate in
one direction let's say here
counterclockwise or this is this is
clockwise
and the other one would be
counterclockwise and we could for
instance say well
we can just say that counterclockwise
would be zero and clockwise would be one
so maybe we call this one here on the
left we call it
uh then one and the other one on the
right
and we call it a zero and then we're
going to make some kind of they arrive
at our end gate and we're going to do
some kind of
well boolean logic with that but the
thing is
that in quantum mechanics
the electron state is not defined
spin up or spin down is not defined
until it is measured
and it is not so that the
state of the spin is not known to us but
it is a certain state it
is up or down but only it's not observed
by me
no that would be classical mechanics
classical physics but in quantum physics
it is like this that no the state
is not defined until it is measured
until it is so-called
observed so then before you observe it
it is like you know mr schroedinger's
cat
it is both the cat of mr uh
both that that and the life at the same
time at the same time the same way
the spin of the electron is both up and
down
at the same time and that means that uh
and when we start observing it then the
spin so-called it
the wave function as we call it it
collapses so only when we observe it
the spin becomes up or down
and if you think this concept is strange
i would like to remind you of mr
the famous talk of mr feynman
where he said if you think you
understand quantum mechanics
you don't understand quantum mechanics
and this is how weird actually this you
can make these weird
phrases and actually being right on top
i really recommend you to watch if
you're interested into these kind of
things
the lecture series of mr richard feynman
it's in black and white very
old-fashioned
but the quality i think is not been
surpassed by any
uh any person from physics
since that time so this black and white
videos are perfect and
there he says i think the lectures are
called the character of physical nature
or something like this
but anyway there he says nobody
understands quantum
mechanics that is mr feynman saying that
so in quantum mechanics the state is not
defined until we observe it
and until the time the state is in
the wave function is in a superposition
state so it is both
spin up and spin down at the same time
when we use
electrons so how can we use this now to
make a quantum
computer well we take these
two things so let me put it back here
let me say it like this
so we have generally we have a wave
function
that that a bit a at the entrance of
our gate it would be both
in the spin up and the spin down state
because we didn't observe it yet but
we're
already going to do calculations with
this wave function
before observing it so we apply the wave
function to our gate
and then we are doing simultaneously the
calculations
with the spin up state as well as the
spin down state
so one bit of information actually i
should say this
one bit arriving at your gate actually
has
two bits of processing
information now how does we then
do this if we take two bits then we have
four calculations doing at the same time
and if we have 100 bits
then we do 2 to the power 100
calculations
at the same time because we didn't
collapse the wave function yet
and to give you an idea then just a
simple computer of
100 bits so maybe we would have
something like this i think this is the
ibm quantum computing machine
and you can see well it's quite complex
maybe this has 100 bits i guess this
entire thing has to be cooled down to
liquid helium or something like this
because it looks to me that this one
will be embedded into
into some kind of cooling vessel because
of this
you can see this thermal shields that
are there and then
the electronic wires that come here
through here and through loops
so that the thermal conductivity is not
so high and here at the bottom
then the calculation is done at very low
temperature because then you have
apparently you can do this quantum
states
well you can imagine that this thing
must cost a fortune
but if you have 100 bits then you can do
2 to the power
100 calculations in simultaneous
simultaneously and to give you an idea
that is about 2 to the power 100 is
about 10 to the power 30.
so if you do one calculation per second
effectively you're doing 10 to the power
30
calculations per second and that is then
about
10 to the power 20 10 gigahertz scores
in parallel
so you can get the idea as if you have
10 to the power 20
very strong computers working uh in
in parallel i don't think that there are
so many computers in the world
and actually in the this would be it's
like
astronomical amounts of processing power
if you just have 100 bits
to be honest i'm quite skeptical but i'm
just explaining to you
how it works to be honest i'm quite
skeptical because
obviously nature didn't do this and
and the advantages would be very well in
nature
imagine that you're a lion or
actually you're the prey of the lion it
would be if you have such
calculating power in your brain or
somehow
then of course you would be able to
predict let's say the future for the
next uh
one or two hours uh with high precision
so you could be
able to either avoid the lion or as
when you're the lion you could easily
catch your prey so i'm very skeptical
that it works
but this is the principle of
of how it works so that is quantum
computing it might be
that this will then be the end of
things like bitcoin or blockchain in
general
cryptography because you can instantly
calculate
all the possible cryptographic
possibilities
so decrypting is actually then a
piece of cake so see you in the next
lecture well i will talk about
a clockless computer so i will actually
talk about your brain which doesn't have
a clock as you know see you in the next
lecture
