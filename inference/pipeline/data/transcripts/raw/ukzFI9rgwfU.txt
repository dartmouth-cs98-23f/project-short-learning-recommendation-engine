0.24,3.52,we know humans learn from their past
2.32,3.36,experiences
3.76,3.599,and machines follow instructions given
5.68,3.919,by humans
7.359,4.16,but what if humans can train the
9.599,4.401,machines to learn from the past data and
11.519,4.32,do what humans can do and much faster
14.0,3.76,well that's called machine learning but
15.839,4.161,it's a lot more than just learning it's
17.76,4.64,also about understanding and reasoning
20.0,4.24,so today we will learn about the basics
22.4,4.4,of machine learning
24.24,4.56,so that's paul he loves listening to new
26.8,4.08,songs
28.8,4.32,he either likes them or dislikes them
30.88,4.0,paul decides this on the basis of the
33.12,2.88,song's tempo
34.88,4.16,genre
36.0,5.44,intensity and the gender of voice for
39.04,5.519,simplicity let's just use tempo and
41.44,6.24,intensity for now so here tempo is on
44.559,5.761,the x axis ranging from relaxed to fast
47.68,5.6,whereas intensity is on the y axis
50.32,6.559,ranging from light to soaring we see
53.28,6.56,that paul likes the song with fast tempo
56.879,5.921,and soaring intensity while he dislikes
59.84,5.44,the song with relaxed tempo and light
62.8,4.56,intensity so now we know paul's choices
65.28,5.44,let's say paul listens to a new song
67.36,6.32,let's name it as song a song a has fast
70.72,5.12,tempo and a soaring intensity so it lies
73.68,4.079,somewhere here looking at the data can
75.84,4.72,you guess whether paul will like the
77.759,5.281,song or not correct so paul likes this
80.56,4.559,song by looking at paul's past choices
83.04,5.36,we were able to classify the unknown
85.119,5.761,song very easily right let's say now
88.4,5.039,paul listens to a new song let's label
90.88,5.84,it as song b so song b
93.439,6.0,lies somewhere here with medium tempo
96.72,5.68,and medium intensity neither relaxed nor
99.439,5.04,fast neither light nor soaring now can
102.4,4.16,you guess whether paul likes it or not
104.479,4.721,not able to guess whether paul will like
106.56,5.599,it or dislike it are the choices unclear
109.2,5.44,correct we could easily classify song a
112.159,5.041,but when the choice became complicated
114.64,4.479,as in the case of song b yes and that's
117.2,4.72,where machine learning comes in let's
119.119,5.121,see how in the same example for song b
121.92,4.799,if we draw a circle around the song b we
124.24,5.2,see that there are four votes for like
126.719,5.041,whereas one would for dislike if we go
129.44,4.0,for the majority votes we can say that
131.76,3.36,paul will definitely like the song
133.44,3.68,that's all this was a basic machine
135.12,4.08,learning algorithm also it's called k
137.12,4.479,nearest neighbors so this is just a
139.2,5.119,small example in one of the many machine
141.599,5.841,learning algorithms quite easy right
144.319,5.521,believe me it is but what happens when
147.44,4.32,the choices become complicated as in the
149.84,4.08,case of song b that's when machine
151.76,4.16,learning comes in it learns the data
153.92,4.24,builds the prediction model and when the
155.92,4.72,new data point comes in it can easily
158.16,5.04,predict for it more the data better the
160.64,4.72,model higher will be the accuracy there
163.2,4.399,are many ways in which the machine
165.36,4.239,learns it could be either supervised
167.599,3.681,learning unsupervised learning or
169.599,4.081,reinforcement learning let's first
171.28,4.239,quickly understand supervised learning
173.68,3.6,suppose your friend gives you one
175.519,4.481,million coins of three different
177.28,4.8,currencies say one rupee one euro and
180.0,4.48,one dirham each coin has different
182.08,5.04,weights for example a coin of one rupee
184.48,5.039,weighs three grams one euro weighs seven
187.12,4.32,grams and one dirham weighs four grams
189.519,4.401,your model will predict the currency of
191.44,4.96,the coin here your weight becomes the
193.92,4.48,feature of coins while currency becomes
196.4,4.64,the label when you feed this data to the
198.4,5.28,machine learning model it learns which
201.04,5.279,feature is associated with which label
203.68,5.279,for example it will learn that if a coin
206.319,4.241,is of 3 grams it will be a 1 rupee coin
208.959,3.92,let's give a new coin to the machine on
210.56,4.399,the basis of the weight of the new coin
212.879,4.72,your model will predict the currency
214.959,5.041,hence supervised learning uses labeled
217.599,4.801,data to train the model here the machine
220.0,4.159,knew the features of the object and also
222.4,3.759,the labels associated with those
224.159,3.601,features on this note let's move to
226.159,3.601,unsupervised learning and see the
227.76,3.68,difference suppose you have cricket data
229.76,4.0,set of various players with their
231.44,4.879,respective scores and wickets taken when
233.76,4.88,you feed this data set to the machine
236.319,4.64,the machine identifies the pattern of
238.64,3.679,player performance so it plots this data
240.959,3.84,with the respective wickets on the
242.319,4.48,x-axis while runs on the y-axis while
244.799,4.08,looking at the data you'll clearly see
246.799,4.08,that there are two clusters the one
248.879,4.401,cluster are the players who scored
250.879,4.801,higher runs and took less wickets while
253.28,4.72,the other cluster is of the players who
255.68,4.88,scored less runs but took many wickets
258.0,4.8,so here we interpret these two clusters
260.56,4.24,as batsmen and bowlers the important
262.8,4.72,point to note here is that there were no
264.8,4.959,labels of batsmen and bowlers hence the
267.52,3.84,learning with unlabeled data is
269.759,3.44,unsupervised learning so we saw
271.36,3.839,supervised learning where the data was
273.199,4.321,labeled and the unsupervised learning
275.199,4.161,where the data was unlabeled and then
277.52,3.76,there is reinforcement learning which is
279.36,3.2,a reward based learning or we can say
281.28,3.359,that it works on the principle of
282.56,4.4,feedback here let's say you provide the
284.639,5.28,system with an image of a dog and ask it
286.96,5.12,to identify it the system identifies it
289.919,4.081,as a cat so you give a negative feedback
292.08,3.52,to the machine saying that it's a dog's
294.0,3.759,image the machine will learn from the
295.6,4.319,feedback and finally if it comes across
297.759,4.16,any other image of a dog it will be able
299.919,3.921,to classify it correctly that is
301.919,3.601,reinforcement learning to generalize
303.84,3.84,machine learning model let's see a
305.52,3.76,flowchart input is given to a machine
307.68,3.28,learning model which then gives the
309.28,4.24,output according to the algorithm
310.96,5.04,applied if it's right we take the output
313.52,4.56,as a final result else we provide
316.0,4.639,feedback to the training model and ask
318.08,4.08,it to predict until it learns i hope
320.639,3.28,you've understood supervised and
322.16,4.08,unsupervised learning so let's have a
323.919,4.801,quick quiz you have to determine whether
326.24,4.32,the given scenarios uses supervised or
328.72,4.16,unsupervised learning simple right
330.56,4.479,scenario one facebook recognizes your
332.88,4.64,friend in a picture from an album of
335.039,5.6,tagged photographs
337.52,6.32,scenario 2 netflix recommends new movies
340.639,5.761,based on someone's past movie choices
343.84,4.96,scenario 3 analyzing bank data for
346.4,4.72,suspicious transactions and flagging the
348.8,4.56,fraud transactions think wisely and
351.12,4.32,comment below your answers moving on
353.36,4.32,don't you sometimes wonder how is
355.44,3.84,machine learning possible in today's era
357.68,4.32,well that's because today we have
359.28,5.199,humongous data available everybody is
362.0,4.24,online either making a transaction or
364.479,4.081,just surfing the internet and that's
366.24,4.72,generating a huge amount of data every
368.56,4.88,minute and that data my friend is the
370.96,4.56,key to analysis also the memory handling
373.44,3.92,capabilities of computers have largely
375.52,4.959,increased which helps them to process
377.36,5.92,such huge amount of data at hand without
380.479,4.881,any delay and yes computers now have
383.28,4.0,great computational powers so there are
385.36,4.16,a lot of applications of machine
387.28,4.0,learning out there to name a few machine
389.52,3.92,learning is used in healthcare where
391.28,4.16,diagnostics are predicted for doctor's
393.44,4.319,review the sentiment analysis that the
395.44,4.16,tech giants are doing on social media is
397.759,3.601,another interesting application of
399.6,3.68,machine learning fraud detection in the
401.36,4.16,finance sector and also to predict
403.28,3.84,customer churn in the e-commerce sector
405.52,4.239,while booking a gap you must have
407.12,4.4,encountered surge pricing often where it
409.759,4.481,says the fair of your trip has been
411.52,4.48,updated continue booking yes please i'm
414.24,3.92,getting late for office
416.0,4.24,well that's an interesting machine
418.16,4.479,learning model which is used by global
420.24,4.399,taxi giant uber and others where they
422.639,3.921,have differential pricing in real time
424.639,5.361,based on demand the number of cars
426.56,6.0,available bad weather rush r etc so they
430.0,4.8,use the surge pricing model to ensure
432.56,4.72,that those who need a cab can get one
434.8,4.799,also it uses predictive modeling to
437.28,4.4,predict where the demand will be high
439.599,4.16,with the goal that drivers can take care
441.68,4.639,of the demand and search pricing can be
443.759,5.521,minimized great hey siri can you remind
446.319,4.081,me to book a cab at 6 pm today ok i'll
449.28,3.84,remind you
450.4,5.12,thanks no problem comment below some
453.12,4.24,interesting everyday examples around you
455.52,4.32,where machines are learning and doing
457.36,4.48,amazing jobs so that's all for machine
459.84,3.84,learning basics today from my site keep
461.84,6.359,watching this space for more interesting
463.68,4.519,videos until then happy learning
