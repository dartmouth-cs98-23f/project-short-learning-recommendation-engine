second,duration,transcript
0.52,4.68,hi I'm Olivia and I am looking for a
2.679,5.92,Quantum job again and this time I have
5.2,5.0,invited Abby hello to help me find a job
8.599,3.761,uh last time when we were looking for
10.2,4.319,Quantum jobs Nick and I were mostly
12.36,3.8,looking for Quantum engineering Quantum
14.519,4.041,Hardware focused roles because that's
16.16,3.76,what our background and expertise is in
18.56,3.799,but we thought it might be helpful to
19.92,4.199,share some typical software engineering
22.359,4.281,type jobs with you this time among
24.119,5.24,others as well uh so why don't we get
26.64,5.599,started let's go all right so this is
29.359,6.561,the first job that Abby has selected for
32.239,6.921,us to review uh the title is software
35.92,5.6,engineer Quantum error correction this
39.16,5.16,is interesting already from like the
41.52,5.08,title first of all I very rarely see
44.32,4.64,software engineering job titles that
46.6,4.639,include the word Quantum to begin with
48.96,4.0,but now specifically here they're
51.239,3.12,mentioning Quantum error correction so
52.96,3.239,that's already like another like a
54.359,4.481,subset of even just Quantum software
56.199,4.441,engineering so that makes me I guess
58.84,4.12,curious to see what this post is going
60.64,4.839,to be about and it's kind of interesting
62.96,4.04,to see how error correction as a field
65.479,3.921,is progressing to the point where
67.0,5.08,they're hiring you know actual software
69.4,6.32,people to kind of join in with that kind
72.08,6.96,of area of research so let's see what
75.72,5.439,experience I would need a bachelor's
79.04,4.079,degree or equivalent practical
81.159,4.241,experience practical experience again
83.119,3.68,this is interesting because the Trap
85.4,3.52,that I see a lot of employers falling
86.799,4.32,into for software roles is they'll be
88.92,4.96,very specific onl like you must have a
91.119,5.36,bachelor's degree in computer science
93.88,4.64,which you know when you're in a already
96.479,3.721,quite a niche if just generally hiring
98.52,3.639,software developers with that kind of
100.2,3.559,background is sometimes hard you get a
102.159,3.56,lot of software people that are coming
103.759,3.841,from less traditional academic
105.719,4.04,backgrounds into software and then
107.6,4.08,especially in a field like Quantum which
109.759,3.481,is even more Niche you're not always
111.68,3.68,guaranteeing that the people applying to
113.24,4.96,your jobs will have the same kind of
115.36,4.56,cookie cutter degree background you also
118.2,4.32,need 5 years of experience with soft
119.92,4.519,Ware development in C++ and python those
122.52,4.36,are the pretty standard languages I
124.439,4.52,would say for the quantum engineering
126.88,4.48,Fields it particularly calls out data
128.959,4.241,structures and algorithms not surprising
131.36,4.2,that that's that's always telling to me
133.2,5.039,when I see that because that means that
135.56,5.48,I you're probably going to get the kind
138.239,5.36,of Infamous uh software engineering type
141.04,5.919,of interview where that means that like
143.599,6.321,this employer will probably probably be
146.959,5.721,asking you to like know how to do a bin
149.92,4.48,research or like Le code Type problems
152.68,3.6,leak code Type problems like you need to
154.4,3.96,be on it with those data structures and
156.28,4.08,those algorithms so yeah if you see the
158.36,4.4,word data structure as an algorithms in
160.36,4.28,a software engineering job post you got
162.76,4.44,to be kind of like doing those leak code
164.64,4.8,problems every day making sure that you
167.2,3.759,can kind of talk about that even if
169.44,3.24,practically you don't use them very much
170.959,3.121,in your day-to-day you kind of have to
172.68,3.36,prove you have that Baseline level of
174.08,3.879,knowledge 3 years of experience testing
176.04,4.64,maintaining launching software products
177.959,4.92,one year with design or ar architecture
180.68,4.119,and then experience with HPC which is
182.879,3.841,high performance Computing real-time
184.799,3.881,operating systems chronal driver
186.72,3.32,development concurrency code development
188.68,3.639,systems programming is that pretty
190.04,5.839,typical stuff yeah I would say this is
192.319,6.56,pretty typical for like a kind of mid to
195.879,6.041,senior level kind of software um kind of
198.879,4.881,job description and I think that you can
201.92,3.959,definitely tell that this is not an
203.76,4.479,entry level position also by looking at
205.879,4.92,the preferred qualifications it says it
208.239,4.961,prefers somebody with a higher level
210.799,3.881,technical degree a Masters or a PhD and
213.2,3.2,one year of experience in a technical
214.68,3.479,leadership role so those of both of
216.4,4.88,those say to me we're looking for a mid
218.159,5.16,to senior level software engineer and I
221.28,3.679,think maybe what's interesting to point
223.319,5.56,out too maybe people don't always know
224.959,6.881,this but there's a w wide range of bands
228.879,4.681,or levels that fall within mid to senior
231.84,3.64,level software engineering jobs and
233.56,4.239,usually when you're interviewing
235.48,4.839,figuring out what band or level to hire
237.799,4.321,you at is part of the interview process
240.319,4.241,so they might say we're looking to hire
242.12,5.0,somebody for this role that's in a range
244.56,5.039,of levels from like 3 to 5 or something
247.12,4.72,like that and they're fine with anybody
249.599,5.121,in that range but what you actually will
251.84,4.28,get hired at um is very important and so
254.72,3.0,you have to negotiate that as part of
256.12,3.679,your interview process I think you can
257.72,4.12,also tell a little bit from like the
259.799,4.161,salary range that I think they have
261.84,4.919,included that here they give you quite a
263.96,5.079,broad range in the salary so probably
266.759,4.841,where you fit on that Spectrum will
269.039,4.681,translate to your level of experience so
271.6,4.12,if a tech lead was applying for this job
273.72,4.16,they would probably be more eligible for
275.72,4.36,the top range of that salary if you're
277.88,4.28,not a tech lead if you have less
280.08,4.08,experience you'll probably be more
282.16,4.84,likely to get the kind of the lower end
284.16,5.599,of this range um but also good that
287.0,4.56,they're publishing their um their salary
289.759,4.801,ranges that is we love salary
291.56,6.199,transparency that's great so other
294.56,5.8,preferred qualifications um experience
297.759,4.961,developing accessible technology
300.36,5.119,ooh that's I've never seen that before
302.72,4.24,so I what I'm interpreting this is
305.479,4.361,anytime you're going to be doing some
306.96,4.16,kind of user-facing um software
309.84,3.84,development so particularly if you're
311.12,4.48,building websites or platforms that have
313.68,4.4,kind of the general public interacting
315.6,5.48,with them you kind of should be thinking
318.08,5.44,about accessibility so that's how um
321.08,5.559,easy it is for people to use your
323.52,4.679,product but um there's this idea of
326.639,3.721,Designing Technologies with an
328.199,4.801,accessibility mindset from the get-go
330.36,4.839,because even though you are kind of um
333.0,4.72,addressing like a potentially Niche area
335.199,5.161,of users the benefits that come actually
337.72,4.28,can affect a very wide range of users
340.36,4.16,the other preferred qualifications are
342.0,5.4,experience interfacing with hardware
344.52,5.2,fpga systems experience with automation
347.4,4.6,monitoring or release
349.72,5.08,management pretty typical stuff right
352.0,5.56,yeah so that's probably stuff like cicd
354.8,4.72,pipelines like logging um pushing out
357.56,3.24,software releases things like that yeah
359.52,4.08,and then the last one is knowledge of
360.8,5.32,quantum Computing Andor error correction
363.6,4.68,I like how that's put on like the
366.12,4.04,preferred I know that's kind of funny
368.28,4.039,because I feel like error correction at
370.16,4.12,least to me is one of those things where
372.319,4.44,it's so Technical and there's so much
374.28,4.0,literature that unless you're already
376.759,2.921,actively working in the field and
378.28,3.28,Publishing in the field it would be
379.68,4.519,pretty hard to jump into a role like
381.56,4.919,this I don't know if I'm qualified for
384.199,3.881,this role but uh I think this is a
386.479,4.361,perfectly good post I think that this
388.08,4.2,would be you know probably a great job
390.84,3.52,hopefully they can find somebody because
392.28,5.52,like you said it's pretty specific all
394.36,5.72,right next we have a Quantum client
397.8,4.16,delivery lead what does the title tell
400.08,4.88,us already I'm going to be working with
401.96,4.679,clients if I get this role and I'm some
404.96,4.12,type of
406.639,3.801,lead that's also kind of what I what I
409.08,3.76,get oh and we're doing something Quantum
410.44,4.8,related oh good what qualifications do I
412.84,4.56,need to have strong client delivery
415.24,4.519,engagement and relationship management
417.4,4.16,skills and experience okay that means
419.759,3.44,you need to have a proven track record
421.56,3.0,of making your clients like you three
423.199,3.761,years of experience in leading
424.56,4.039,successful delivery engagements project
426.96,3.919,management and client relationship
428.599,5.241,management basically what I gather from
430.879,6.16,this role is it's not entry level this I
433.84,5.479,would say is solidly mid um but they
437.039,4.481,need basically people who understand
439.319,5.16,what Quantum Computing is you can't come
441.52,4.119,in totally blind to the technology and
444.479,3.0,they need somebody who has good
445.639,2.68,interpersonal relationship skills
447.479,2.28,somebody who's going to be very
448.319,3.801,organized somebody who's going to be
449.759,4.801,able to work with clients but talk to
452.12,5.32,them about technical Concepts but maybe
454.56,5.039,not at um you know a super detailed
457.44,4.28,technical level like it says here
459.599,4.72,somebody who's more on the Enterprise or
461.72,5.0,seite level which means an executive
464.319,4.041,who's sort of further removed from being
466.72,3.68,an individual contributor and like
468.36,3.6,building the software or the technology
470.4,4.479,themselves but they still need to have a
471.96,4.359,really good grasp of where it's going
474.879,3.72,yeah it definitely seems like quite a
476.319,4.521,broad audience that this person would
478.599,3.801,have to be kind of of interacting with
480.84,4.079,this would be a great role for somebody
482.4,4.639,who's an excellent science Communicator
484.919,4.441,I cannot emphasize enough how organized
487.039,4.72,you have to be for these types of roles
489.36,4.839,yeah super organized you have to be
491.759,4.0,pretty fluent in product and project
494.199,3.641,management software you have to know how
495.759,4.761,to use them like the back of your hand
497.84,5.199,um you have to be very organized and
500.52,4.92,often this involves bothering people and
503.039,4.041,telling them to follow up with you and
505.44,3.28,give you the information or the content
507.08,3.48,that you asked for weeks ago that they
508.72,3.879,were supposed to have delivered by a
510.56,4.8,specific date so a lot of this is also
512.599,5.481,stakeholder management as well achieve a
515.36,5.44,high NPS promoter score of nine or 10 in
518.08,5.0,the client engagements that you lead now
520.8,4.44,that one that is helpful that is helpful
523.08,4.759,but I don't think I think if this has an
525.24,5.56,acronym and I hate acronyms you should
527.839,5.801,not use acronyms in a job posing at
530.8,5.88,least without defining them oh also they
533.64,4.92,say NPS which stands for net promoter
536.68,5.08,score promoter score so they're saying
538.56,5.959,NPS promoter score so net promoter score
541.76,5.04,promoter score like when people say ATM
544.519,4.201,machines right it doesn't make sense
546.8,4.4,grammar aside at least that's something
548.72,4.799,very tangible so it's basically just a
551.2,3.879,satisfaction rating that your clients
553.519,4.56,give you I think you know at the end of
555.079,5.801,the year in terms of How likely they are
558.079,4.921,to you know keep working with you and to
560.88,6.12,recommend you to other clients as well
563.0,6.24,cool sounds good uh next job okay we
567.0,5.6,have another software job quantum
569.24,4.8,software systems architect SL engineer
572.6,3.359,you're going to be typing out a computer
574.04,4.039,lot but it says roles and
575.959,3.56,responsibilities extensive experience
578.079,3.481,with software design for Hardware
579.519,3.44,control and effective at developing
581.56,3.0,close working relationships with
582.959,3.12,collaborators I feel like this is like
584.56,3.719,so
586.079,4.0,vague oh wait but they do break it down
588.279,4.361,into like minimum and preferred so these
590.079,5.121,I guess are just the this is also not a
592.64,4.04,role or responsibility so that bullet
595.2,4.52,point extensive experience with software
596.68,5.08,design is not a responsibility
599.72,5.04,this looks like a very like last minute
601.76,6.28,cut and paste job description but that's
604.76,5.199,okay so minimum qualifications typically
608.04,3.919,requires a minimum of 5 years of related
609.959,4.081,experience with a bachelor's degree or 3
611.959,3.44,years at a master's degree or a PhD with
614.04,3.68,no
615.399,5.361,experience okay again like pretty
617.72,5.76,flexible in terms of like if you have a
620.76,5.16,more advanced academic background
623.48,5.72,they'll be willing to look for less time
625.92,5.8,of like working experience but if the
629.2,4.16,highest level of academic education you
631.72,3.76,have as a bachelor's degree then you'll
633.36,5.159,be expected to demonstrate a longer
635.48,4.799,period of um relevant work experience
638.519,2.841,which I think is fair and I think maybe
640.279,2.921,something to point out because I didn't
641.36,4.84,know this when I was applying to jobs
643.2,4.92,straight out of my PhD the experience
646.2,4.0,that you have when you're doing your PhD
648.12,3.92,counts towards work experience I didn't
650.2,3.24,know that for some reason and when I was
652.04,2.84,graduating people were saying like you
653.44,3.399,know how many years of work experience
654.88,4.199,you have with python in my head I would
656.839,3.481,think zero even though I knew Somey
659.079,2.281,being a student right but I was
660.32,1.88,technically a student but that's not
661.36,3.2,right that's not what they're looking
662.2,3.84,for the correct answer is five or six or
664.56,3.839,you know however long you had been using
666.04,4.239,python at in graduate school and then it
668.399,5.521,says experience in Python software
670.279,6.36,development signal generators lasers
673.92,4.52,electrooptic modulators single Photon
676.639,3.121,counting modules and spatial light I
678.44,3.24,don't know what that has to do with
679.76,3.519,python software development this is the
681.68,4.159,kind of program that I did when I was in
683.279,5.081,graduate school is I used python to
685.839,5.761,control all of the room temperature
688.36,5.56,Electronics and boxes basically in the
691.6,4.52,lab and so I had to learn how to
693.92,4.599,interface and write like drivers and
696.12,5.519,different modules so that I could like
698.519,5.32,basically control all of the the control
701.639,4.561,Electronics from my laptop and I do view
703.839,4.201,that as like a very specific type of
706.2,4.4,programming actually because like that
708.04,3.919,is what I have the most experience in
710.6,3.52,but when it comes to stuff like data
711.959,5.44,structures and algorithms and leak code
714.12,5.399,I'm pretty useless because I pretty much
717.399,5.12,only know how to program
719.519,4.241,hardware and boes so I don't know
722.519,2.961,they're very different types of
723.76,3.639,programming okay so this is kind of
725.48,4.2,interesting to compare to like the first
727.399,4.56,one that we looked at which was
729.68,4.64,definitely earring more towards like a
731.959,4.32,software developer who can kind of
734.32,3.879,muddle their way through the physics
736.279,4.12,stuff whereas this kind of role is
738.199,4.88,someone that like know like having that
740.399,4.521,Hardware experience is crucial but if
743.079,4.801,you've like got that python software
744.92,4.719,skills like that's you know great too
747.88,4.28,the next one is also kind of interesting
749.639,4.601,desire and ability to work on system
752.16,4.72,level CAD modeling have you ever done
754.24,4.839,CAD modeling like a lot of like moving
756.88,4.84,pictures around on a
759.079,4.721,gooey um but I'm surprised to see it in
761.72,4.16,a job posting like this actually does it
763.8,4.839,have any relevance to building quantum
765.88,5.199,computers I don't know sure yeah it does
768.639,4.361,um but I guess I wouldn't think of it as
771.079,3.921,a software engineering role to me that's
773.0,4.32,more of like something that a hardware
775.0,4.88,engineer does I like how specifically
777.32,4.24,they put desire and ability to work on
779.88,4.12,system level CAD modeling I don't know
781.56,4.68,if that says something about how enjoy
784.0,5.399,desire to work on CAD
786.24,5.0,systems um so even if you're great at it
789.399,4.521,if you do not want be doing this every
791.24,4.24,single day you're not getting that job
793.92,3.4,okay fair enough preferred
795.48,3.719,qualifications background in CAD
797.32,3.4,modeling I feel like that would be maybe
799.199,3.681,a little bit more hard to find for a
800.72,3.76,software engineer but totally possible
802.88,4.36,and then the last one is software
804.48,5.4,experience for Quantum control it's
807.24,4.44,interesting that the the CAD stuff is
809.88,3.959,something that I think they realize that
811.68,3.92,maybe it's a hard skill to find plus
813.839,3.68,everything else so they're willing to
815.6,3.88,hire someone without significant
817.519,4.201,experience in that area but it would be
819.48,4.719,a plus if you did have experience there
821.72,4.119,and crucially it sounds like that is
824.199,3.921,something that you will have to do as
825.839,4.201,part of the job so you should be willing
828.12,3.399,to work on that and even if you don't
830.04,5.599,have experience with it you should be
831.519,6.401,willing to learn it MH next oo okay I
835.639,4.601,have no idea what the heck this is a
837.92,5.2,Quantum treasure y consultant this looks
840.24,6.2,fun just like from the name I would
843.12,4.92,apply to senior level role so you have
846.44,3.959,to have many years of doing Quantum
848.04,6.799,treasury consultancy
850.399,6.8,Abby skills required Quantum Financial
854.839,5.321,modeling develop and Implement Quantum
857.199,5.08,algorithms and model models to simulate
860.16,4.799,complex Financial scenarios including
862.279,5.281,cash flow forecasting risk assessment
864.959,4.32,portfolio optimization liquidity these
867.56,3.56,are all things for sure that quantum
869.279,4.401,computers could maybe do one day these
871.12,5.32,are I'm at least happy to see listing
873.68,4.56,very specific types of financial
876.44,4.24,applications that I know people are
878.24,4.159,working on in the field so they've done
880.68,3.0,their homework they understand that
882.399,3.161,Quantum Computing doesn't apply to
883.68,5.719,everything it could apply to these
885.56,7.519,specific things however it is you know
889.399,5.56,further down the the line in terms of
893.079,3.841,how soon this is going to be implemented
894.959,4.24,I think that Quantum Financial
896.92,4.56,algorithms definitely require better
899.199,5.041,Hardware in order to actually be
901.48,4.56,implemented so I think that this impl
904.24,4.159,them but you wouldn't get any useful
906.04,6.479,results right that's what we mean like I
908.399,6.321,certainly wouldn't put my 401k in this
912.519,4.32,Quantum Financial modeling system yet
914.72,3.799,and I think there would be needing to
916.839,5.8,see a little bit more proof of concept
918.519,5.961,here treasury strategy optimization I
922.639,4.921,don't even know what this means okay so
924.48,6.4,I'm assuming there is an area of finance
927.56,4.88,that is called Treasury and they're
930.88,4.079,looking like that's like seems to be
932.44,5.44,like a classical Financial Field and
934.959,6.44,they want to look for ways to apply
937.88,4.56,Quantum Computing to that area mhm but
941.399,3.041,it sounds like you're going to have some
942.44,4.959,help uh from some Finance people and
944.44,4.959,some data scientists yes that's good
947.399,4.12,apply Quantum optimization algorithms to
949.399,4.161,enhance cash management hedging
951.519,4.041,strategies Capital allocation and
953.56,4.839,investment decisions while considering
955.56,4.88,risk and regulatory requirements we
958.399,4.521,should just go down to fi and see if
960.44,4.759,someone from there could answer tell us
962.92,6.839,what this job is we would get
965.199,6.601,mansplained so hard anyways it says you
969.759,4.921,need to come up with novel Quantum
971.8,4.519,algorithms for Treasury and analytics
974.68,4.04,which sounds very difficult to me coming
976.319,5.041,up with any novel Quantum algorithms to
978.72,4.44,me is a very ambitious goal this is a
981.36,3.32,research role I think it's going to be
983.16,3.359,incredibly hard to find someone with
984.68,4.159,like the relevant experience in both
986.519,3.841,this specific area of Finance Plus plus
988.839,3.281,like the quantum research background to
990.36,3.88,be able to develop novel Quantum
992.12,4.0,algorithms no I agree because you pretty
994.24,4.8,much I don't want to say you know you
996.12,5.44,need a PhD to do this kind of work but I
999.04,5.0,feel like you might because learning how
1001.56,4.959,to develop novel Quantum algorithms is
1004.04,4.64,just so Technical and so hard that it
1006.519,4.12,requires many years of education and
1008.68,3.639,training so although it's interesting
1010.639,3.841,that they didn't even specify but they
1012.319,4.041,didn't specify degree they don't even
1014.48,3.68,use the word research in this job
1016.36,3.88,posting it's a little bit of a weird job
1018.16,5.479,posting like I have no doubt that this
1020.24,5.4,is a real job and it seems like the
1023.639,4.2,people writing it do have
1025.64,5.559,some good idea of what they would be
1027.839,6.72,doing and what they want but they aren't
1031.199,5.36,listing qualifications like typical job
1034.559,3.561,postings do so that's a little weird I
1036.559,3.081,don't think they have a realistic
1038.12,2.919,understanding of the kind of people that
1039.64,2.84,would be able to fill this kind of
1041.039,2.841,position that's exactly what it is they
1042.48,2.719,know what they want but they don't know
1043.88,4.24,how to find those people and they don't
1045.199,5.36,know probably the education and the
1048.12,4.72,experi that those types of people would
1050.559,4.401,have this is an internal posting is also
1052.84,4.199,another possibility maybe they already
1054.96,4.719,have somebody in mind internally for
1057.039,4.64,this role and just legally this is a job
1059.679,3.561,posting that they had to put in public
1061.679,3.24,on the internet even though they know
1063.24,3.64,who they're going to hire for this role
1064.919,4.481,that's always a possibility when you see
1066.88,4.48,job postings so that's another reason
1069.4,4.04,why you know you might never hear back
1071.36,3.96,from a company once you apply to them or
1073.44,3.32,you get ghosted or whatever sometimes it
1075.32,2.88,has nothing to do with you sometimes the
1076.76,3.6,company just already knows who they want
1078.2,4.56,to hire and they just had to post the
1080.36,5.0,job for legal reasons all right shall we
1082.76,5.56,move on yes we have
1085.36,5.16,another Consulting related one I think
1088.32,5.68,like summer associate is just code for
1090.52,5.44,like Consulting summer internship in my
1094.0,4.24,understanding of it so it even says here
1095.96,4.0,this is an internship program um about
1098.24,3.08,you work with other researchers to
1099.96,3.839,document your findings and publish
1101.32,4.68,scientific papers okay that's unusual
1103.799,5.76,and that's cool to see because a lot of
1106.0,5.72,these Finance or consultancy type roles
1109.559,3.881,don't actually encourage publication
1111.72,4.079,because a lot of their work has to be
1113.44,4.92,kept proprietary and internal but I like
1115.799,4.561,this because I want to know what these
1118.36,4.04,people are doing and I never get to
1120.36,3.84,really understand what's going on inside
1122.4,3.08,these you know Consulting hubs because
1124.2,3.04,they're pretty secretive usually about
1125.48,3.48,their work but if it says that they're
1127.24,2.919,looking for you to publish your findings
1128.96,2.64,then that's pretty cool and it's
1130.159,3.4,important for interns of course to build
1131.6,4.28,up their resume in that way as well this
1133.559,4.881,one actually feels more targeted to
1135.88,4.4,people with that research background and
1138.44,4.719,they're kind of showing that you can
1140.28,5.399,still like pursue your research um kind
1143.159,4.041,of academic career while doing this work
1145.679,3.601,in industry and then I don't know what
1147.2,4.28,this one means but contribute to
1149.28,5.519,company's IP by pursuing necessary
1151.48,5.6,protections of Ip so basically that was
1154.799,5.041,that saying we'll let you publish some
1157.08,4.64,things in scientific papers but also the
1159.84,3.839,like the secret Source also the secret
1161.72,3.76,Source we're going we're going to make
1163.679,3.0,that a patent yeah that's what that
1165.48,3.559,means but hey maybe you'll get some
1166.679,4.401,patents on your resume you know play
1169.039,3.681,right they're working in Industry you
1171.08,3.64,know you need to be doing stuff that is
1172.72,4.52,going to make the company money as well
1174.72,4.079,as like the kind of open science like
1177.24,4.96,they seem to be doing like a little bit
1178.799,5.721,of both that's capitalism baby uh key
1182.2,4.32,qualifications and skills no prior
1184.52,3.88,familiarity with Finance or financial
1186.52,3.6,use cases required okay that's cool
1188.4,5.08,that's an internship so they're looking
1190.12,4.96,to teach you about finance things they
1193.48,3.64,really expect somebody to come in I
1195.08,4.92,think with a more theoretical
1197.12,5.039,understanding but not necessarily in
1200.0,3.4,financial applications specifically so I
1202.159,2.721,like that preference is given to
1203.4,3.92,candidates with a strong publication
1204.88,3.84,record okay I think this is pretty good
1207.32,4.88,this is a good post this is a good
1208.72,6.24,internship if I was working in these
1212.2,4.8,areas which I'm not and if I was younger
1214.96,3.52,which I'm not I would apply to this job
1217.0,3.159,I think this is a really solid post I
1218.48,3.28,like that they want you to publish I
1220.159,3.4,like that they're you know looking to
1221.76,3.84,hire somebody with a strong publication
1223.559,5.161,record because this says to me that we
1225.6,6.559,want to grow our company's
1228.72,4.52,in a scientific field which I like
1232.159,2.361,because that means you know you're
1233.24,2.36,probably not only going to be publishing
1234.52,2.08,you're going to be going to conferences
1235.6,4.079,you're going to be presenting at
1236.6,6.16,conferences and that's the you know uh
1239.679,4.48,scientific Community vibe that I like
1242.76,3.08,that they're opening it up quite broad
1244.159,3.921,like they could see someone with a
1245.84,4.12,Quantum information Theory background
1248.08,4.599,having just as much value as someone who
1249.96,4.76,comes from like a symmetric key
1252.679,4.641,cryptography background which is like
1254.72,4.199,quite different areas of research but
1257.32,4.239,both could potentially
1258.919,5.0,um have value here um whether you're
1261.559,4.24,from like a classical um software
1263.919,4.161,background or like a quantum theory
1265.799,3.841,background it's a great post you know
1268.08,3.76,sounds really
1269.64,3.6,interesting so that was the last job
1271.84,3.16,posting that we found that we thought
1273.24,4.679,might be relevant what did we learn
1275.0,4.48,today Abby the job hunting is hard job
1277.919,3.12,hunting is really hard you got to know a
1279.48,4.0,lot of python that's what I think you
1281.039,4.281,got to know much want to ask for python
1283.48,3.48,yes and another thing I don't want to go
1285.32,4.12,on too long of ATT tangent on this but
1286.96,4.8,another thing I will say is coming from
1289.44,4.92,an academic background I think a lot of
1291.76,4.399,people expect industry type jobs which
1294.36,4.199,all of these were to be sort of a
1296.159,4.561,fallback plan if you don't make it in
1298.559,4.401,Academia and I think what you can really
1300.72,4.319,tell from this video and from the
1302.96,3.839,postings that we saw are that these are
1305.039,4.961,very very competitive jobs these are
1306.799,5.801,hard to get this is not a fallback plan
1310.0,4.799,by any means this is something that you
1312.6,4.8,have to work hard for and aspire to just
1314.799,5.12,like any academic position yeah and I
1317.4,6.399,think I'm just excited to see more and
1319.919,5.921,more software related jobs coming about
1323.799,3.88,I think even you know a few years ago
1325.84,4.24,when I was first you know coming into
1327.679,4.921,this field I don't think there were many
1330.08,5.479,jobs at at all that were specifically
1332.6,4.959,advertised for a software audience but
1335.559,4.48,now we're starting to see actually
1337.559,5.48,people that come from a traditional uh
1340.039,5.081,software background have a a lot of um a
1343.039,4.201,lot to offer and there are kind of more
1345.12,4.439,specific coding and software and
1347.24,4.24,infrastructure at ated roles that don't
1349.559,3.801,necessarily always require a solid
1351.48,3.28,Quantum background M that's good that
1353.36,2.96,means the field is growing and it's
1354.76,3.159,healthy and it's progressing along the
1356.32,3.52,timeline that we would expect it to so
1357.919,3.441,that's all good all right well I guess
1359.84,3.56,that's it for now thank you for joining
1361.36,3.559,us and if you see any job postings that
1363.4,3.84,you're interested about you know let us
