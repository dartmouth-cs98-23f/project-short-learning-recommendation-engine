6.96,5.12,hey everyone welcome to this week's live
9.36,4.96,session today's topic is top programming
12.08,4.32,languages for data science
14.32,4.16,but before we begin i'd like to thank
16.4,4.639,our viewers for tuning in and actively
18.48,4.48,participating in these sessions
21.039,4.4,now let's wait for a while for people to
22.96,2.479,tune in
25.84,4.16,also we have a dedicated team here to
27.84,3.92,answer all your queries so if you have
30.0,5.6,any questions let us know them in the
31.76,3.84,chat section below we'll get back to you
36.16,3.76,i see a few people joining in now
42.719,3.84,also at the end of the session there's
44.239,5.201,going to be a quiz and one lucky winner
46.559,5.921,will get an amazon voucher
49.44,3.04,so stay tuned for that
53.92,4.68,all right i see people joining in
59.76,4.32,alright so for the ones joined now
61.76,6.0,today's topic is top programming
64.08,3.68,languages for data science
69.68,4.24,all right i think we're ready to begin
71.84,4.4,the session now so let's go ahead and
73.92,2.32,begin
80.0,5.52,at number 10 we have ruby
82.32,5.119,now developed by yukihiro matsumoto ruby
85.52,4.56,is one of the top programming languages
87.439,4.801,used it is the basis for frameworks like
90.08,3.999,ruby on rails
92.24,4.48,it has an expressive and easy to
94.079,5.68,understand syntax and provides over 60
96.72,6.399,000 libraries and has a definitive set
99.759,5.36,of keywords and is dynamically typed
103.119,5.601,when it comes to using ruby for data
105.119,5.841,science it offers three core softwares
108.72,4.16,first up is apache arrow which is a
110.96,3.839,cross language data structure for
112.88,4.32,in-memory data
114.799,4.96,here calculations are taken care of by
117.2,4.959,apache arrows table format where ruby
119.759,5.04,can perform data manipulation
122.159,4.64,another essential feature is numo which
124.799,4.401,enables to handle numeric array like
126.799,3.921,numpy and is the fundamental part of
129.2,2.96,data science or machine learning
130.72,4.08,execution
132.16,5.12,kumo is the gpu version of pneumo and is
134.8,5.68,75 times faster
137.28,5.679,red trainer enables deep learning tasks
140.48,4.479,ruby as of now is not a data science
142.959,3.601,centric language with a very large
144.959,6.161,established library
146.56,4.56,it doesn't have an ecosystem like python
152.959,4.961,at number nine we have julia
155.36,4.08,now julia was recently developed by a
157.92,4.16,group of four people at the
159.44,4.079,massachusetts institute of technology
162.08,4.0,it's a multi-purpose programming
163.519,3.681,language specifically designed for data
166.08,3.2,science
167.2,4.319,now julia has an excellent dispatch
169.28,4.16,making it extremely fast
171.519,4.08,it is faster than python because it is
173.44,4.48,designed to quickly implement the math
175.599,4.72,concepts like linear algebra and matrix
177.92,5.2,representations
180.319,5.28,julia includes an repl which is a read
183.12,5.6,eval print loop or interactive command
185.599,5.36,line similar to that of python
188.72,4.799,julia offers high scalability and
190.959,5.041,companies like ford apple and amazon
193.519,4.401,among others use julia
196.0,5.2,other programming languages have better
197.92,5.36,compelling advantages over this language
201.2,5.28,julia is relatively new and still has a
203.28,3.2,lot of scope for growth
206.959,4.801,next up is kayla
208.959,5.2,now scala was created by martin odersky
211.76,3.92,and as an object-oriented and functional
214.159,4.401,programming language
215.68,5.44,it allows users to access java and java
218.56,4.8,virtual machine libraries
221.12,5.28,other key features include fewer lines
223.36,5.2,of code faster deployment testing and
226.4,3.68,development improved stability and
228.56,3.679,productivity
230.08,4.079,when it comes to data science apache
232.239,3.841,spark is the widely used tool in the
234.159,3.761,industry which is written using scalar
236.08,4.239,programming language
237.92,4.319,spark is an extension for hadoop which
240.319,3.601,does batch processing as well as
242.239,4.401,real-time processing
243.92,5.36,there are many other features like val
246.64,4.48,high order functions partial functions
249.28,3.84,pattern matching and case classes and
251.12,4.72,collections among others that scala
253.12,2.72,offers
256.88,4.0,next up is matlab
258.959,4.24,matlab is a programming platform
260.88,3.599,explicitly designed for engineers and
263.199,3.361,scientists
264.479,4.401,it was developed by mathworks and is
266.56,4.56,used for mathematical computation
268.88,5.12,it can be integrated with c and c plus
271.12,5.84,plus to analyze data develop algorithms
274.0,5.199,and create models and applications
276.96,4.4,it offers powerful debugging tools and
279.199,4.961,uses a graphics command to make
281.36,4.88,visualization of results easier
284.16,4.479,matlab offers rich machine learning
286.24,4.239,libraries and is best suited for matrix
288.639,4.0,calculations
290.479,4.321,one can use matlab for a wide range of
292.639,3.921,applications including deep learning and
294.8,5.76,machine learning finance and
296.56,4.0,computational biology among others
301.68,5.04,at number six we have tensorflow
304.32,5.2,tensorflow is a computational framework
306.72,4.319,created in 2017 for building machine
309.52,3.92,learning models
311.039,4.561,it offers toolkits to write code at your
313.44,3.92,preferred level of abstraction
315.6,4.4,it allows abstract models which are
317.36,5.44,highly optimized for components
320.0,4.4,some of these methods include tf.layers
322.8,3.0,which allows you to play with the layers
324.4,5.28,of a neural net
325.8,6.36,tf.metrics to evaluate model performance
329.68,4.079,and tf.estimator to build production
332.16,3.68,ready models
333.759,4.321,all in all tensorflow is a pretty
335.84,3.919,commonly used programming language and
338.08,4.32,as advice for people who have a good
339.759,2.641,hang of it
343.759,5.921,at number five we have javascript
346.88,4.879,developed by brendan ike in 1995
349.68,4.16,javascript is a server-side and
351.759,4.16,client-side programming language
353.84,3.919,it offers a wide range of libraries and
355.919,3.921,frameworks
357.759,4.88,now moving on to pros when it comes to
359.84,5.199,using javascript in data science
362.639,4.881,first up is data visualization
365.039,6.641,now javascript offers libraries such as
367.52,6.08,d3.js chart.js plotley.js and many
371.68,4.239,others that make powerful data
373.6,5.12,visualization
375.919,5.041,next up is product integration companies
378.72,4.24,use web technologies with a node based
380.96,3.84,tag for the core product
382.96,3.76,as a result of which javascript is
384.8,4.399,widely used
386.72,4.64,next is tensorflow.js now this is a
389.199,4.081,machine learning library developed by
391.36,4.72,google
393.28,4.8,moving on to cons functionality now
396.08,3.839,javascript does not offer data science
398.08,3.679,packages and functions when compared to
399.919,4.321,other programming languages
401.759,4.481,when it comes to productivity javascript
404.24,4.72,doesn't make it easy with the help of
406.24,4.799,manuals or guides
408.96,3.92,nodejs is also not suitable for
411.039,3.28,computationally intensive tasks and
412.88,3.68,multi-threading
414.319,4.241,when it comes to opportunity costs it is
416.56,5.0,easier to learn languages like r or
418.56,3.0,python
422.72,3.599,the next commonly used language is our
424.72,3.759,good old java
426.319,4.88,more than 3 billion mobile phones use
428.479,5.12,java today some of its saline features
431.199,5.041,include incredible stability excellent
433.599,5.201,memory management and good security
436.24,5.04,given these advantages java products are
438.8,6.16,also storming the market today
441.28,6.0,libraries like weka java ml mlib and
444.96,5.2,deep learning 4j are used for machine
447.28,4.56,learning and data science problems java
450.16,4.64,virtual machine is one of the best
451.84,5.759,platforms to learn and write code
454.8,5.519,then again popular frameworks like spark
457.599,4.401,big data hadoop flink and hype are
460.319,3.841,written in java
462.0,4.56,java has scala which as we discussed
464.16,5.68,earlier is good for data science
466.56,5.12,and let's face it it is incredibly fast
469.84,3.84,java has time and again proven to be
471.68,4.639,useful in all aspects of growing
473.68,2.639,technologies
477.759,5.28,next up is sql
479.68,5.919,sql was developed by raymond f boyce
483.039,4.56,structured query language or sql is used
485.599,3.361,to access and retrieve data from
487.599,3.361,database
488.96,4.32,it is easy to understand with its simple
490.96,4.639,syntax and english-like commands
493.28,3.919,from a data science perspective sql is
495.599,3.521,used for pre-processing and machine
497.199,4.72,learning purposes
499.12,4.799,now about 2.5 quintillion bytes of data
501.919,3.84,is generated every day
503.919,3.84,in order to store such large amounts of
505.759,3.761,data it is strictly necessary to make
507.759,4.241,use of databases
509.52,4.879,sql is best suited for this
512.0,5.36,with features like slicing filtering
514.399,5.921,aggregation and sorting sql allows you
517.36,4.479,to handle such large amounts of data it
520.32,5.839,also integrates well with other
521.839,4.32,programming languages like python and r
527.839,4.801,at number 2 we have r
530.0,4.8,it was created in 1992 by robert e
532.64,3.6,harker and robert gentleman
534.8,3.2,it provides an environment for
536.24,3.599,implementing statistical techniques
538.0,3.12,along with data handling and storage
539.839,3.281,features
541.12,4.719,it offers a wide range of packages and
543.12,5.68,libraries and can be compiled on unix
545.839,4.721,windows and macos platforms
548.8,4.24,r has an extensive library for
550.56,5.76,manipulation and wrangling some of the
553.04,5.919,packages are data dot table read r g
556.32,5.04,plot 2 and gg edit the last two of which
558.959,5.521,are used for data visualization
561.36,4.8,other ml packages include mice carrot
564.48,3.6,and random forest
566.16,3.76,now our programming language is open
568.08,6.0,source which makes it highly cost
569.92,4.16,effective for a project of any size
574.88,3.28,and to top the list as always we have
577.04,3.52,python
578.16,3.76,python developed by guido van rossen is
580.56,3.76,an open source general purpose
581.92,4.24,programming language with simple syntax
584.32,3.76,and english-like commands
586.16,3.359,it is used for web frameworks and web
588.08,3.6,applications
589.519,4.481,python also provides a massive database
591.68,6.159,of libraries like cyclic learn
594.0,4.959,tensorflow cbon pytorch matplotlib and
597.839,4.081,many more
598.959,5.121,there are now over 70 000 libraries in
601.92,3.68,the python package index and the number
604.08,4.24,continues to grow
605.6,5.04,the library matplotlib provides a strong
608.32,5.44,foundation around which other libraries
610.64,4.639,like ggplot pandas plotting pytorch and
613.76,4.319,others are built
615.279,5.12,arguably the most popular data analysis
618.079,4.161,library is pandas
620.399,4.0,python has the tool set to perform a
622.24,4.56,variety of powerful functions and it's
624.399,5.401,no wonder by data scientist embrace
626.8,3.0,python
634.0,4.079,all right now before we move on to the
