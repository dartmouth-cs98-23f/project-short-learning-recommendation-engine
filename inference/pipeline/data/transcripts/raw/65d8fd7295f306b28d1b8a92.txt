Hey guys, I'm Venkat and in this video, we'll 
discuss how indexes actually work and help  
improve the performance of our sql queries. We'll 
discuss how both the index types work - clustered  
and non-clustered. If you're new to indexes, we've 
already covered all the basics you need in this  
sql server tutorial for beginners course. Please 
check out the videos from parts 35 to 38. I'll  
include the link in the description of this video. 
Now, consider this Employees table. EmployeeId is  
the primary key, so by default a clustered index 
on the EmployeeId column is created. This means,  
employee data is sorted by EmployeeId column 
and physically stored in a series of data pages  
in a tree-like structure that looks like 
the following. The nodes at the bottom of  
the tree are called data pages or leaf nodes 
and contains the actual data rows in our case  
employee rows. These employee rows are sorted 
by EmployeeId column because EmployeeId  
is the primary key and by default, a clustered 
index on this column is created. For our example,  
let's say in this Employees table we have 
1200 rows and let's assume in each data page  
we have 200 rows. So, in the first data page we 
have 1 to 100 rows, in the second 201 to 400,  
in the third 401 to 600, so on and so forth. The 
node at the top of the tree is called root node.  
The nodes between the root node and the leaf 
nodes are called intermediate levels. The root  
and the intermediate level nodes contain index 
rows. Each index row contains a key value,  
in our case EmployeeId and a pointer to either 
an intermediate level page in the B-Tree  
or a data row in the leaf node. So, this tree-like 
structure has a series of pointers that helps the  
query engine find data quickly. For example, let's 
say we want to find employee row with employee id  
1120. So, the database engine starts at the root 
node and it picks the index node on the right  
because the database engine knows it is this node 
that contains employee ids from 801 to 1200. From  
there, it picks the leaf node that is present 
on the extreme right because employee data rows  
from 1001 to 1200 are present in this leaf node. 
The data rows in the leaf node are sorted by  
employee id so it's easy for the database engine 
to find the employee row with id equals 1120.  
Notice, in just 3 operations sql server is able to 
find the data we are looking for. It's making use  
of the clustered index we have on the table. Let's 
look at this in action. This piece of sql script  
at the top creates Employees table with these four 
columns - Id, Name, Email and Department. First,  
let's create the table. This second block of code 
here inserts test data into Employees table. Let's  
actually execute the script. It's going to take 
a few seconds to complete and that's because,  
if you take a look at this code, notice we're 
using while loop to insert one million rows  
into this table and if we click on the messages 
tab, in a few seconds we should see a message  
saying 100,000 rows inserted, that's because 
for every hundred thousand rows that we insert,  
we are logging the message. Let's 
give it a few seconds to complete.
There we go, all the 1 million rows are 
inserted. Now, let's execute this select  
query. We are trying to find employee whose id is 
932 000 and before we execute this query, click  
on this icon right here which includes the actual 
execution plan. You can also use the keyboard  
shortcut CTRL + M. There we go, we got the one 
row that we expected and when I click on the  
execution plan and when I hover over this, notice 
the operation is clustered index seek, meaning the  
database engine is using the clustered index 
on the EmployeeId column to find the employee  
row we want. Number of rows read is 1, Actual 
number of rows for all executions is also 1. Now,  
number of rows read is the number of rows 
sql server has to read to produce the query  
result. In our case EmployeeId is unique, so 
we expect one row and that is represented by  
actual number of rows for all executions. With the 
help of the index, sql server is able to directly  
read that one specific employee row we want, hence 
both number of rows read and actual number of rows  
for all executions is 1. So, the point is if 
there are thousands or even millions of records,  
sql server can easily and quickly 
find the data we are looking for,  
provided there is an index that 
can help the query find data.  
Now, we have a clustered index on the EmployeeId 
column, so when we search by EmployeeId,  
sql server can easily and quickly find the data 
we are looking for, but what if we search by  
employee name? At the moment, there is no index 
on the "Name" column. So, there is no easy way for  
sql server to find the data we are looking for. 
SQL server has to read every record in the table  
which is extremely inefficient from performance 
standpoint. Let's actually look at this in action.  
Here is the query, we are trying to find the 
employee by name. Let's execute it. There we go,  
we have the one row that we expected and I click 
on the execution plan and hover over this. Notice,  
the operation is clustered index scan. Since 
there is no proper index to help this query,  
the database engine has no other choice than to 
read every record in the table. This is exactly  
the reason why number of rows read is 1 million, 
that is every row in the table and if you take a  
look at actual number of rows for all executions, 
the value is 1. How many rows are we expecting in  
the result? Well, only one row, because there is 
only one employee whose name is "ABC 932000". So,  
to produce this one row as the result, sql server 
has to read all the 1 million rows from the table,  
because there is no index to help this query. 
This is called index scan and in general, index  
scans are bad for performance. This is when we 
create a non-clustered index on the "Name" column.  
Actually, sql server is helping us here. Notice, 
it's actually telling us there is a missing index.  
To improve the performance of this select query, 
it's asking us to create a non-clustered index  
on the "Name" column. Why on the "Name" column? 
Well, that's because we are looking up employees  
by name. So, let's actually right click on this 
and select this option - "Missing Index Details".  
We actually have the required code here to 
create non-clustered index. Let's uncomment this.  
Create non-clustered index, we are creating on the 
Name column and let's give this index a name "IX"  
for index, we are creating it on the Employees 
table and on the Name column. Let's execute this.
Now, let's execute that same select query 
again. Click on the "Execution plan" tab  
and we have several steps here. We'll discuss 
execution plans in detail in our upcoming videos.  
For now, just understand, we read the execution 
plans from right to left and top to bottom. So,  
we start here and when I hover over this, 
notice, now the operation is index seek  
on the non-clustered index. Before we understand 
this execution plan, let's first understand how  
non-clustered index is stored in the database. In 
a non-clustered index, we do not have table data.  
We have key values and row locators. We created 
a non-clustered index on the "Name" column. So,  
the key values, in this case employee names 
are sorted and stored in alphabetical order.  
The row locators that are present at the bottom of 
the tree contain employee names and cluster key of  
the row, in our example employee id is the cluster 
key. Why? because employee id is the primary key,  
by default it is the cluster key. Now, if we look 
at one of the row locators, notice the names of  
the employees are sorted in alphabetical order and 
we also have their respective employee id. Now,  
if you remember, on the employee id we have the 
clustered index. Now, when we search employee  
by name both these indexes, non-clustered index 
on the Name column and clustered index on the  
EmployeeId column are going to work together to 
find the employee that we are looking for. Let's  
look at the steps involved. First, sql server 
uses the non-clustered index on the Name column to  
quickly find this employee entry in the index. In 
a non-clustered index along with the employee name  
we also have the cluster key, in our case its 
employee id. The database engine knows there is  
clustered index on employee id, so this clustered 
index is then used to find the respective employee  
record. Now, let's relate these steps to the 
execution plan that we have in sql server  
management studio. Remember, we read the execution 
plan from right to left and top to bottom. So,  
we start on the top right here. Notice, the first 
step is index seek on the non-clustered index.  
On the Name column, we have non-clustered index 
and sql server is using it to find an entry for  
this employee in the index and remember, in the 
index along with the employee name we also have  
employee id which is the primary key. Next, 
this primary key is used to find an entry  
in the clustered index, that's why we have 
the operation here as key lookup clustered.
The value from the cluster index, in our case 
employee id is then used in an inner join with  
the Employees table to retrieve the respective 
employee record. If you're new to these execution  
plans and wondering why this nested loop or inner 
join is required, we'll discuss these execution  
plans in detail in our upcoming videos. Now, 
on this slide, I have "Estimated Subtree Cost"  
with and without index. So, for this query - 
Select * from employees where name equals whatever  
name we supply, estimated subtree cost without 
index is 11. something. With index, it is 0.006.  
Just imagine the impact it can have on performance 
if we don't have index on the Name column.  
If you're wondering, how did I get these 
statistics? Well, in SQL server management studio,  
on the "Execution plan" tab, if you hover over the 
"Select" operation, you get the total estimated  
subtree cost for all these operations. In our 
upcoming videos in this series, we'll discuss sql  
server execution plans in detail with examples. 
That's it in this video. Thank you for listening.
