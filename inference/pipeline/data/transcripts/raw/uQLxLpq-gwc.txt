second,duration,transcript
0.0,5.199,hey everyone welcome back to another
1.36,3.839,recall by dataiku video
6.16,3.519,my name is tina and i'm a data scientist
8.0,3.28,that works in tech in this video we're
9.679,4.161,going to talk about software engineering
11.28,4.08,versus data science in practice this
13.84,3.199,video will be divided into four
15.36,3.36,different parts first let's talk about
17.039,3.441,what is data science and what is
18.72,3.68,software engineering then let's talk
20.48,4.0,about the similarities the differences
22.4,4.08,and finish off with in my opinion why
24.48,3.84,you should choose one or the other i
26.48,3.6,want to preface this video by saying
28.32,3.359,first that software engineering and data
30.08,3.92,science rules can be very different
31.679,4.56,depending on the company the industry
34.0,4.64,and even the specific team in the
36.239,4.241,company there's also roles such as data
38.64,4.48,engineering machine learning or ml
40.48,4.32,engineering and data science ml research
43.12,3.279,roles that share some similarities with
44.8,3.84,both software engineering and data
46.399,3.921,science so do please keep in mind that
48.64,3.68,it's not always super clean cut and
50.32,3.2,there's lots of overlap specifically in
52.32,2.8,this video though i'm going to be
53.52,3.679,talking about software engineering
55.12,3.919,versus data science okay first up let's
57.199,3.601,define data science and software
59.039,3.601,engineering data science is defined as a
60.8,4.24,combination of multiple fields including
62.64,4.0,statistics scientific methods artificial
65.04,4.079,intelligence ai
66.64,3.36,and data analysis to extract value from
69.119,2.961,data
70.0,3.84,in essence is the usage of a bunch of
72.08,3.84,different fields to get valuable
73.84,3.84,integration from data some example
75.92,3.839,projects that data science will do are
77.68,4.4,things like say like creating a product
79.759,4.161,sales forecasting model perhaps using a
82.08,3.6,machine learning based solution
83.92,3.199,also things like creating and analyzing
85.68,4.079,experiments that test out different
87.119,4.561,versions of a website for example and
89.759,3.441,analyzing data to help companies make a
91.68,3.52,decision on where they should be
93.2,4.48,investing the most money on the other
95.2,5.279,hand software engineering is defined as
97.68,4.799,a systematic disciplined quantifiable
100.479,4.481,approach to the development operation
102.479,5.521,and maintenance of software that is the
104.96,4.799,application of engineering to software
108.0,4.159,here it's about applying engineering
109.759,4.4,principles to software to solve problems
112.159,3.92,and build products so some example
114.159,3.681,projects would include building a web
116.079,3.921,application creating infrastructure to
117.84,4.16,allow processes to run with increased
120.0,4.0,efficiency and automating certain
122.0,3.68,processes like creating an automated
124.0,3.119,trading bot for example these are just
125.68,2.88,some examples to illustrate what
127.119,3.521,projects may look like for data
128.56,4.08,scientists and software engineers but
130.64,4.08,really both these fields are incredibly
132.64,3.52,vast and diverse and there's just so
134.72,2.8,many different types of projects
136.16,3.2,hopefully though these give you some
137.52,3.76,insights into what software engineers
139.36,3.84,and data science work on next up let's
141.28,4.08,talk about similarities between software
143.2,3.84,engineering and data science
145.36,3.599,one similarity between data science and
147.04,4.32,software engineering is that they both
148.959,4.161,involve coding in some form data
151.36,3.519,scientists generally use code in order
153.12,3.6,to take one or more data sets and use
154.879,3.521,them to implement things like models
156.72,3.68,perform analyses and to create
158.4,3.839,visualizations usually the code is not
160.4,3.68,reused beyond the original purpose with
162.239,3.921,the exception of deploying models into
164.08,4.96,production that are meant to be reused
166.16,4.88,common languages include sql python and
169.04,4.0,r on the other hand software engineers
171.04,3.76,use code to build products and services
173.04,3.839,that are often meant to be used by lots
174.8,3.6,of end users this is why coding and
176.879,3.761,software engineering is generally far
178.4,4.0,more rigorous than in data science the
180.64,3.92,code standard for software engineering
182.4,4.16,is far higher and it's common to conduct
184.56,4.24,many tests on the code to make sure that
186.56,4.48,all the use cases are covered
188.8,4.88,some common examples of coding languages
191.04,5.52,include python javascript c
193.68,4.72,c sharp as well as java so overall both
196.56,3.84,data scientists and software engineers
198.4,3.919,code as part of their day-to-day jobs
200.4,3.6,although the nature of coding is
202.319,3.441,actually quite different another big
204.0,3.36,similarity between data science and
205.76,3.839,software engineering is that they are
207.36,3.68,both widely applicable to lots of
209.599,3.521,different fields say if you have a
211.04,4.24,career in like investment banking
213.12,4.24,marketing or like medicine you're likely
215.28,4.239,to stay in your respective field since
217.36,4.08,your expertise is specific to that
219.519,3.521,domain where at least you won't travel
221.44,3.84,too far from your original domain but
223.04,4.4,this restriction does not apply for data
225.28,4.239,scientists and software engineers both
227.44,3.76,of these careers are very skill based
229.519,3.601,and people can take their skills and
231.2,4.16,apply it across different companies and
233.12,3.839,industries using myself as an example i
235.36,3.76,started my data science journey in
236.959,4.321,bioinformatics specifically cancer
239.12,4.479,genomics i then worked for a bit in
241.28,4.239,finance and finally ended up in tech
243.599,3.761,similarly i also know a lot of friends
245.519,4.08,of mine who did the same computer
247.36,3.92,science degree as me and then worked as
249.599,3.121,software engineers in a variety of
251.28,4.239,different places like hedge funds
252.72,5.039,e-commerce pharma and tech however this
255.519,4.56,is not to say that switching industries
257.759,4.641,is like no effort you will definitely
260.079,4.001,need some time to ramp up in the company
262.4,3.28,and the new field and you'll need to
264.08,4.24,learn some domain knowledge but in
265.68,4.88,general this is not that hard to do in
268.32,4.319,my opinion learning the technical skills
270.56,4.639,is far harder than learning things like
272.639,4.481,domain specific concepts and terminology
275.199,3.841,the next similarity between software
277.12,3.84,engineering and data science is that
279.04,4.32,both these fields require you to do a
280.96,4.239,lot of problem solving these are not
283.36,3.839,fields where you can memorize concepts
285.199,3.841,or terminology the core skill that you
287.199,3.681,develop for both of these fields is
289.04,3.439,problem solving because there are so
290.88,3.2,many problems
292.479,3.28,for example software engineering you may
294.08,3.76,be faced with a specific task you need
295.759,4.081,to do but you have never seen anything
297.84,3.6,like it before so you have to think
299.84,3.359,through a task try to break it down into
301.44,3.599,its components and think of the logic
303.199,4.081,and how you can kind of like fit things
305.039,4.241,together to complete your task you
307.28,4.0,probably get stuck a lot too and consult
309.28,4.24,the coding savior which is stack
311.28,4.0,overflow to try to solve your problem
313.52,4.08,you probably also spend a lot of your
315.28,4.8,time if like not most of your time
317.6,4.159,trying to figure out how to fix a bug in
320.08,3.2,your code to fix it you first try to
321.759,3.041,reproduce it then test out the
323.28,3.84,assumptions that you think might be
324.8,3.76,causing it again problem solving data
327.12,3.12,science also centers around problem
328.56,3.44,solving you're spending a lot of time
330.24,4.08,wrestling with the data to get it to
332.0,4.639,yield some precious insights you're
334.32,4.8,coming up with a hypothesis testing it
336.639,4.481,out sometimes over and over again to try
339.12,3.84,to discover a negative insight you may
341.12,3.359,also run into the issue of your data not
342.96,3.519,being in the correct format to use a
344.479,3.201,statistical model where to use a machine
346.479,2.801,learning model so then you need to
347.68,3.44,figure out what is the correct format
349.28,3.359,and then how to transform your data to
351.12,3.28,that format you'll probably also be
352.639,3.84,consulting the coding savior stack
354.4,4.72,overflow or its cousin for math and
356.479,4.241,stats stack exchange problem solving is
359.12,3.76,fundamental to both software engineering
360.72,3.039,and data science and as a secondary
362.88,2.56,skill
363.759,3.44,patience another similarity between
365.44,3.199,software engineering and data science is
367.199,3.28,that you're expected to learn a lot of
368.639,3.761,things as new technologies are coming
370.479,3.84,out both fields have a lot of new
372.4,3.919,innovations coming out every month if
374.319,3.921,not every week or every day new
376.319,4.0,languages new ways of doing things and
378.24,4.0,new infrastructures to be able to keep
380.319,4.32,up with everything is of course not
382.24,4.16,possible however part of your job is to
384.639,3.68,keep tabs on the new technologies that
386.4,3.519,are coming out and also kind of like
388.319,3.281,pick and choose the ones that you think
389.919,3.441,are going to be the most useful for you
391.6,3.439,self learning and upskilling is very
393.36,4.08,common among software engineers and data
395.039,4.321,scientists and this ability to learn
397.44,3.52,quickly and efficiently is a skill that
399.36,3.2,will take you far now speaking about
400.96,3.359,learning things if you are interested in
402.56,3.199,learning more about data science
404.319,3.121,including machine learning algorithms
405.759,3.44,and up and coming technologies you
407.44,3.52,should definitely check out dataiku's
409.199,3.44,free learning resource linked in the
410.96,3.04,descriptions the learning material is
412.639,3.361,really beginner friendly with lots of
414.0,3.84,illustrations and examples data iq
416.0,3.599,itself is also the cutting edge of data
417.84,3.28,science and artificial intelligence by
419.599,3.681,systemizing the use of data and
421.12,4.88,providing a single central solution for
423.28,4.56,the design deployment and management of
426.0,2.96,ai applications so if you're interested
427.84,2.88,in data science you should definitely
428.96,3.44,check out how the field is progressing
430.72,3.759,now let's talk a little bit about the
432.4,3.519,differences so the first major
434.479,3.361,difference between software engineering
435.919,4.241,and data science is what i call a
437.84,4.24,building versus discovering mindset
440.16,3.439,software engineering is very much about
442.08,3.2,building things and using good
443.599,3.761,engineering principles to make sure that
445.28,4.16,the things you build are efficient meet
447.36,3.6,the desired specifications and can stand
449.44,3.039,the test of time with a software
450.96,3.44,engineering project you spend a lot of
452.479,3.601,time up front figuring out and designing
454.4,3.6,what you want your end product to look
456.08,3.36,like then you would go and implement
458.0,3.36,with the goal of getting this end
459.44,4.08,product now for data science it's
461.36,4.08,centered around what i call a discovery
463.52,4.16,mindset you do your research and you
465.44,3.759,form a hypothesis then you go out there
467.68,3.519,and look at your data and try to
469.199,4.081,manipulate it analyze it and ultimately
471.199,4.321,make sense of it your goal is to
473.28,4.8,discover new insights from the data so
475.52,4.32,there's no like well-defined end goal in
478.08,3.76,mind this difference between building
479.84,3.68,versus discovering is actually well
481.84,3.52,represented by the names of the roles
483.52,4.72,themselves a software engineer is
485.36,5.04,fundamentally an engineer that builds
488.24,3.92,but specifically builds with software a
490.4,3.919,data scientist is fundamentally a
492.16,4.24,scientist but specifically discovers
494.319,3.841,using data okay so second difference
496.4,3.68,between the two fields is that data
498.16,3.599,science is very interdisciplinary while
500.08,3.92,software engineering is more narrow in
501.759,4.321,scope what i mean by this is that data
504.0,4.319,science is essentially a combination of
506.08,3.92,coding math and stats and business
508.319,3.28,you're expected to be proficient at each
510.0,3.279,of these skills to be a good data
511.599,3.92,scientist sometimes you expect to do
513.279,4.161,analyses sometimes to do models
515.519,3.681,sometimes to design statistically sound
517.44,4.079,experiments sometimes to communicate
519.2,4.48,with stakeholders and sometimes to build
521.519,4.161,data pipelines in comparison a software
523.68,4.08,engineer's major skill sets are in
525.68,4.159,designing implementing and maintaining
527.76,4.639,software through code many software
529.839,5.041,engineers liken coding as a specific
532.399,4.481,skill like carpentry or blacksmithing
534.88,3.28,that they continuously try to hone this
536.88,2.8,difference between data science and
538.16,3.28,software engineering is another big
539.68,4.32,reason why the two fields actually tend
541.44,3.839,to attract really different people data
544.0,3.12,science generally attracts people who
545.279,3.201,enjoy learning about and like combining
547.12,2.88,different fields while software
548.48,3.44,engineering often attracts people who
550.0,4.399,are interested in becoming like better
551.92,4.56,and better at a specific craft the third
554.399,3.601,difference is that the responsibilities
556.48,3.28,of a software engineer are more
558.0,3.519,well-defined than the responsibilities
559.76,3.04,of a data scientist if you come in as a
561.519,2.721,software engineer you usually have a
562.8,3.039,pretty clear idea of what your
564.24,3.599,responsibilities are if you're an
565.839,4.401,android developer for example you expect
567.839,4.241,to be working on developing android apps
570.24,3.44,if you're a cloud developer you're
572.08,3.199,expected to be designing building and
573.68,2.88,maintaining cloud systems and if you're
575.279,2.961,a web developer you expect to be
576.56,3.12,developing something for the web
578.24,3.2,although web development itself is
579.68,3.92,pretty huge and you can get even more
581.44,3.92,specializations like front-end and
583.6,3.2,back-end and full-stack web development
585.36,3.76,but case in point there's a lot of
586.8,4.24,specializations with relatively clearly
589.12,3.92,defined responsibilities
591.04,3.84,for data scientists though the role and
593.04,3.359,expectations are often not clearly
594.88,3.36,defined what it is that you're supposed
596.399,4.0,to do varies a lot depending on the
598.24,4.08,company the industry and the team even
600.399,3.521,within the same company a data scientist
602.32,3.44,that works on one team can be doing
603.92,3.84,something completely different from a
605.76,3.92,data scientist and another team this is
607.76,3.6,mostly because data science as a field
609.68,3.52,is far less mature than software
611.36,4.56,engineering so there are not as many
613.2,4.8,specializations and expectations set in
615.92,3.919,place for specific roles companies often
618.0,4.16,use data science as kind of like a
619.839,4.321,catch-all for data related work that
622.16,3.44,involves some sort of coding with that
624.16,3.52,being said though as the field is
625.6,4.239,maturing the differences between data
627.68,3.76,scientists data analysts research
629.839,4.161,scientists machine learning engineer and
631.44,4.48,data engineer are becoming more distinct
634.0,4.079,and in the future i think these roles
635.92,3.68,would be more clearly defined and head
638.079,2.961,in the same direction as software
639.6,3.28,engineering after discussing the
641.04,3.84,similarities and differences between
642.88,3.6,software engineering and data science if
644.88,3.04,you're trying to decide yourself whether
646.48,3.359,you should be choosing software
647.92,3.2,engineering or data science here are
649.839,3.44,some key factors that you should
651.12,3.52,consider at least in my opinion remember
653.279,2.8,what we discussed earlier about how
654.64,3.28,software engineers have a building
656.079,4.0,mindset while data scientists have a
657.92,4.08,discovery mindset i think this is one of
660.079,3.521,the most important factors to consider
662.0,3.44,do you get excited about building things
663.6,3.6,with an end goal in mind or do you get
665.44,3.36,more excited about discovering things
667.2,3.36,that you don't know about before me
668.8,3.599,personally i get very excited about
670.56,3.839,discovering new things and that weighed
672.399,4.081,in really heavily into going into data
674.399,4.081,science a second key consideration is
676.48,4.4,how much you like to code if you see
678.48,4.08,coding as a craft that you wish to hone
680.88,3.199,over time then you may be more suited
682.56,3.6,for software engineering if you care
684.079,4.0,more about using code as a tool to
686.16,3.84,achieve your purposes but you're not
688.079,3.841,like particularly excited about the
690.0,3.92,coding itself then you may want to
691.92,3.2,consider data science finally how
693.92,3.12,willing are you to learn
695.12,3.36,interdisciplinary fields both software
697.04,3.039,engineering and data science involve
698.48,3.52,learning a lot of new things however
700.079,3.681,data science is emerging of the very
702.0,3.76,different fields of computer science
703.76,3.759,math and business so if you're not
705.76,3.6,interested in all these different areas
707.519,3.76,or at least like willing to learn about
709.36,3.68,all these areas then data science may
711.279,3.201,not be for you i do want to point out
713.04,3.44,that something that you should not be so
714.48,3.84,worried about is the salary both
716.48,3.76,software engineering and data science
718.32,3.44,pay extremely well and you'll have a
720.24,3.12,similar compensation throughout your
721.76,3.199,career all right so what do you think do
723.36,3.2,you lean more towards data science or
724.959,3.761,software engineering do leave a comment
726.56,4.079,below one final thing i just want to say
728.72,3.84,if you really can't choose between one
730.639,3.601,or the other there's actually a lot of
732.56,3.839,software engineers that become data
734.24,3.68,scientists and vice versa so don't
736.399,3.12,stress out about it too much all right
737.92,2.96,that's all i have for you today thanks
739.519,5.32,so much for watching and i will see you
740.88,3.959,guys in the next video
