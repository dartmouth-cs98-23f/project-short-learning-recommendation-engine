1.28,4.88,so what is git and why is it so popular
4.0,3.44,git is the most popular version control
6.16,3.439,system in the world
7.44,4.079,a version control system records the
9.599,4.481,changes made to our code over time
11.519,4.32,in a special database called repository
14.08,2.08,we can look at our project history and
15.839,3.36,see
16.16,5.039,who has made what changes when and why
19.199,3.761,and if we screw something up we can
21.199,2.801,easily revert our project back to an
22.96,3.12,earlier state
24.0,3.519,without a version control system we'll
26.08,3.76,have to constantly store
27.519,3.121,copies of the entire project in various
29.84,2.8,folders
30.64,4.16,this is very slow and doesn't scale at
32.64,3.84,all especially if multiple people have
34.8,3.439,to work on the same project
36.48,4.0,you would have to constantly toss around
38.239,3.201,the latest code via email or some other
40.48,3.52,mechanisms
41.44,3.52,and then manually merge the changes so
44.0,3.039,in a nutshell
44.96,4.079,with a version control system we can
47.039,2.881,track our project history and work
49.039,3.121,together
49.92,3.68,now version control systems fall into
52.16,4.079,two categories
53.6,3.92,centralized and distributed in a
56.239,3.201,centralized system
57.52,3.839,all team members connect to a central
59.44,2.56,server to get the latest copy of the
61.359,2.88,code
62.0,4.4,and to share their changes with others
64.239,2.641,subversion and microsoft team foundation
66.4,2.48,server
66.88,3.279,are examples of centralized version
68.88,2.559,control systems
70.159,3.201,the problem with the centralized
71.439,2.72,architecture is the single point of
73.36,2.96,failure
74.159,4.32,if the server goes offline we cannot
76.32,2.88,collaborate or save snapshots of our
78.479,2.481,project
79.2,3.12,so we have to wait until the server
80.96,3.28,comes back online
82.32,4.24,in distributed systems we don't have
84.24,4.16,these problems every team member has a
86.56,2.879,copy of the project with its history on
88.4,3.44,their machine
89.439,3.761,so we can save snapshots of our project
91.84,3.52,locally on our machine
93.2,3.919,if the central server is offline we can
95.36,2.56,synchronize our work directly with
97.119,2.881,others
97.92,4.479,git and mercurial are examples of
100.0,5.119,distributed version control systems
102.399,4.4,out of all these git is the most popular
105.119,4.64,version control system in the world
106.799,4.161,because it's free open source super fast
109.759,2.961,and scalable
110.96,3.199,operations like branching and merging
112.72,3.2,are slow and painful in
114.159,3.361,other version control systems like
115.92,3.76,subversion or tfs
117.52,3.44,but they're very fast and git we'll talk
119.68,3.92,about this later
120.96,4.4,so git is almost everywhere more than 90
123.6,2.32,of software projects in the world use
125.36,2.8,get
125.92,4.72,that's why almost every job description
128.16,4.079,for a software developer mentions git
130.64,3.599,so if you're looking for a job as a
132.239,3.841,software developer git is one of the
134.239,3.681,skills you must have on your resume
136.08,3.76,you should know it inside out you should
137.92,3.44,know how it works and how to use it to
139.84,4.0,track your project history
141.36,3.599,and collaborate with others effectively
143.84,2.96,if you want to learn git
144.959,4.0,i have a one hour tutorial here on my
146.8,3.76,channel the link is below this video
