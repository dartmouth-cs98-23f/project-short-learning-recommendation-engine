chat section below we'll get back to you
i see a few people joining in now
also at the end of the session there's
going to be a quiz and one lucky winner
will get an amazon voucher
so stay tuned for that
all right i see people joining in
alright so for the ones joined now
today's topic is top programming
languages for data science
all right i think we're ready to begin
the session now so let's go ahead and
begin
at number 10 we have ruby
now developed by yukihiro matsumoto ruby
is one of the top programming languages
used it is the basis for frameworks like
ruby on rails
it has an expressive and easy to
understand syntax and provides over 60
000 libraries and has a definitive set
of keywords and is dynamically typed
when it comes to using ruby for data
science it offers three core softwares
first up is apache arrow which is a
cross language data structure for
in-memory data
here calculations are taken care of by
apache arrows table format where ruby
can perform data manipulation
another essential feature is numo which
enables to handle numeric array like
numpy and is the fundamental part of
data science or machine learning
execution
kumo is the gpu version of pneumo and is
75 times faster
red trainer enables deep learning tasks
ruby as of now is not a data science
centric language with a very large
established library
it doesn't have an ecosystem like python
at number nine we have julia
now julia was recently developed by a
group of four people at the
massachusetts institute of technology
it's a multi-purpose programming
language specifically designed for data
science
now julia has an excellent dispatch
making it extremely fast
it is faster than python because it is
designed to quickly implement the math
concepts like linear algebra and matrix
representations
julia includes an repl which is a read
eval print loop or interactive command
line similar to that of python
julia offers high scalability and
companies like ford apple and amazon
among others use julia
other programming languages have better
compelling advantages over this language
julia is relatively new and still has a
lot of scope for growth
next up is kayla
now scala was created by martin odersky
and as an object-oriented and functional
programming language
it allows users to access java and java
virtual machine libraries
other key features include fewer lines
of code faster deployment testing and
development improved stability and
productivity
when it comes to data science apache
spark is the widely used tool in the
industry which is written using scalar
programming language
spark is an extension for hadoop which
does batch processing as well as
real-time processing
there are many other features like val
high order functions partial functions
pattern matching and case classes and
collections among others that scala
offers
next up is matlab
matlab is a programming platform
explicitly designed for engineers and
scientists
it was developed by mathworks and is
used for mathematical computation
it can be integrated with c and c plus
plus to analyze data develop algorithms
and create models and applications
it offers powerful debugging tools and
uses a graphics command to make
visualization of results easier
matlab offers rich machine learning
libraries and is best suited for matrix
calculations
one can use matlab for a wide range of
applications including deep learning and
machine learning finance and
computational biology among others
at number six we have tensorflow
tensorflow is a computational framework
created in 2017 for building machine
learning models
it offers toolkits to write code at your
preferred level of abstraction
it allows abstract models which are
highly optimized for components
some of these methods include tf.layers
which allows you to play with the layers
of a neural net
tf.metrics to evaluate model performance
and tf.estimator to build production
ready models
all in all tensorflow is a pretty
commonly used programming language and
as advice for people who have a good
hang of it
at number five we have javascript
developed by brendan ike in 1995
javascript is a server-side and
client-side programming language
it offers a wide range of libraries and
frameworks
now moving on to pros when it comes to
using javascript in data science
first up is data visualization
now javascript offers libraries such as
d3.js chart.js plotley.js and many
others that make powerful data
visualization
next up is product integration companies
use web technologies with a node based
tag for the core product
as a result of which javascript is
widely used
next is tensorflow.js now this is a
machine learning library developed by
google
moving on to cons functionality now
javascript does not offer data science
packages and functions when compared to
other programming languages
when it comes to productivity javascript
doesn't make it easy with the help of
manuals or guides
nodejs is also not suitable for
computationally intensive tasks and
multi-threading
when it comes to opportunity costs it is
easier to learn languages like r or
python
the next commonly used language is our
good old java
more than 3 billion mobile phones use
java today some of its saline features
include incredible stability excellent
memory management and good security
given these advantages java products are
also storming the market today
libraries like weka java ml mlib and
deep learning 4j are used for machine
learning and data science problems java
virtual machine is one of the best
platforms to learn and write code
then again popular frameworks like spark
big data hadoop flink and hype are
written in java
java has scala which as we discussed
earlier is good for data science
and let's face it it is incredibly fast
java has time and again proven to be
useful in all aspects of growing
technologies
next up is sql
sql was developed by raymond f boyce
structured query language or sql is used
to access and retrieve data from
database
it is easy to understand with its simple
syntax and english-like commands
from a data science perspective sql is
used for pre-processing and machine
learning purposes
now about 2.5 quintillion bytes of data
is generated every day
in order to store such large amounts of
data it is strictly necessary to make
use of databases
sql is best suited for this
with features like slicing filtering
aggregation and sorting sql allows you
to handle such large amounts of data it
also integrates well with other
programming languages like python and r
at number 2 we have r
it was created in 1992 by robert e
harker and robert gentleman
it provides an environment for
implementing statistical techniques
along with data handling and storage
features
it offers a wide range of packages and
libraries and can be compiled on unix
windows and macos platforms
r has an extensive library for
manipulation and wrangling some of the
packages are data dot table read r g
plot 2 and gg edit the last two of which
are used for data visualization
other ml packages include mice carrot
and random forest
now our programming language is open
source which makes it highly cost
effective for a project of any size
and to top the list as always we have
python
python developed by guido van rossen is
an open source general purpose
programming language with simple syntax
and english-like commands
it is used for web frameworks and web
applications
python also provides a massive database
of libraries like cyclic learn
tensorflow cbon pytorch matplotlib and
many more
there are now over 70 000 libraries in
the python package index and the number
continues to grow
the library matplotlib provides a strong
foundation around which other libraries
like ggplot pandas plotting pytorch and
others are built
arguably the most popular data analysis
library is pandas
python has the tool set to perform a
variety of powerful functions and it's
no wonder by data scientist embrace
python
all right now before we move on to the
quiz let me quickly show you the data
science programs offered by simply learn
anybody who wishes to take up the data
science program
can just navigate
to our
official website
