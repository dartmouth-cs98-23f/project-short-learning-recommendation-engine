0.599,6.24,have you heard about chat GPT are you
4.74,5.04,wondering whether you can use it to
6.839,5.22,create project management artifacts such
9.78,3.66,as a project plan well if that's the
12.059,3.24,case then you've come to the right place
13.44,4.259,because today I'm going to be showing
15.299,4.681,you exactly what this tool can do and
17.699,4.5,whether or not it is something that you
19.98,5.4,could potentially use so I've got on the
22.199,4.561,screen here I've put in one of um one of
25.38,4.2,the first kind of prompts just to show
26.76,4.74,you what chat GPT is if you are yet to
29.58,3.9,use it maybe you've heard about it I'm
31.5,5.46,not quite sure or maybe it's new to you
33.48,5.4,all together so this is what chat GPT is
36.96,4.56,telling me from a prompt where I'm
38.88,4.44,asking it is essentially what it is so
41.52,3.84,if we look here it is essentially a
43.32,5.1,larger language model developed by open
45.36,6.48,AI which by the way is kind of owned by
48.42,6.36,Microsoft basically what it does is you
51.84,4.399,input different prompts and what it does
54.78,4.2,is it gives you different responses
56.239,6.041,based on a data set that I believe goes
58.98,5.28,back to 2021 one that's almost looking
62.28,4.26,at a load of data across the internet or
64.26,4.679,that was published before that time it's
66.54,5.16,still in a development phase so do bear
68.939,4.441,that in mind and it's also has a lot of
71.7,3.9,interest at the moment so sometimes you
73.38,3.9,can't access the tool maybe you have an
75.6,4.14,account already if you do like myself
77.28,5.4,here I can log in and start using it if
79.74,5.22,you don't you may be brought to a page
82.68,4.32,that says it's kind of being used and it
84.96,3.299,is a kind of maximum capacity and you
87.0,2.88,might not be able to use it at the time
88.259,3.781,that you want to so just bear that in
89.88,3.96,mind there is a pro feature as well
92.04,3.899,which um
93.84,4.02,will help you to access it in times of a
95.939,4.32,lot of usage but yeah just thought I'd
97.86,4.5,give you that kind of context what I'm
100.259,5.701,going to show you now is how you can
102.36,5.939,actually use chat GPT to create a
105.96,3.659,project plan so
108.299,3.36,one of the things I'd just like to
109.619,6.301,quickly note is that
111.659,6.42,chat GPT is most effective when you kind
115.92,3.6,of get your prompt the kind of more
118.079,3.961,information you provide in your prompt
119.52,5.16,so I've already thought of this ahead of
122.04,4.56,time of course you may want to adapt
124.68,3.6,this it will depend on the project
126.6,3.359,you're running and you also might want
128.28,4.38,to play around with it
129.959,3.721,um but this is one as an example I'm
132.66,3.54,going to be doing it for a marketing
133.68,4.139,project to show you what this tool can
136.2,3.6,do and how quickly it can do it so what
137.819,5.041,I've put here is create a project plan
139.8,5.159,in tabular form for a marketing project
142.86,4.379,and if we hit this button here it's
144.959,4.801,going to create it for us so here we go
147.239,4.021,it's kind of going live sure here's an
149.76,3.96,example of a project plan for a
151.26,4.559,marketing project in tabular form and as
153.72,4.62,you can see here it is starting to build
155.819,5.7,it out so
158.34,5.039,you've we've got the task description a
161.519,3.421,start date and end date and a duration
163.379,3.661,and what it's doing here is it's
164.94,4.439,actually giving us sample tasks as well
167.04,4.38,so obviously this is very very quick
169.379,4.08,it's very easy it's a very very basic
171.42,3.959,project plan don't get me wrong
173.459,3.961,um but it is one nonetheless and it
175.379,5.94,gives you some ideas for tasks as well
177.42,5.76,so consider this as a first draft and
181.319,3.481,that's one of the benefits of chat gbt
183.18,3.059,is that you'll notice this when it
184.8,5.579,finishes
186.239,6.36,um you can ask the the tool to expand
190.379,4.381,upon what it's already done
192.599,3.841,um so we'll wait for it to finish and
194.76,3.479,I'll see what I mean
196.44,3.78,so at the bottom here it says note this
198.239,3.36,project plan is just an example and will
200.22,3.299,vary depending on the scope of the
201.599,4.441,marketing project the timeline and task
203.519,4.44,can be adjusted accordingly so what we
206.04,3.479,can do at this point is we could ask you
207.959,5.161,know could put in a couple more prompts
209.519,5.821,such as provide more tasks
213.12,4.56,we could we could add other prompts such
215.34,3.6,as provide more Milestones or
217.68,4.8,alternatively we could add something
218.94,6.18,like provide more columns
222.48,4.38,for data capture as an example and let's
225.12,3.3,see what happens as I say I don't know
226.86,4.92,what this is going to provide me it's a
228.42,6.179,new tool it's developing all the time
231.78,5.22,um but as you can see here it's given us
234.599,4.741,much you know much a much more expanded
237.0,4.5,product plan that you may need so and
239.34,3.479,again it's going to add the task so this
241.5,4.319,is the kind of thing you want to do with
242.819,5.461,it you want to give it a response give
245.819,4.98,it a prompt and then if you need to you
248.28,4.56,can always add to it by adding extra
250.799,3.961,prompts and that's what's great it kind
252.84,3.899,of uses the former response and builds
254.76,4.86,upon it so the next thing that we could
256.739,5.941,do is we could then say something like
259.62,6.84,provide provide this project plan with
262.68,5.64,milestones and subtasks as an example
266.46,4.2,so what I would suggest that you do is
268.32,4.5,head over to chat GPT and and stop
270.66,3.84,playing around with the tool what you
272.82,3.18,can do I'll just wait for it to finish I
274.5,3.3,could press the stop generating button
276.0,3.72,but I'm not going to let's just let you
277.8,3.6,know finish this let's finish so that I
279.72,3.9,can we can have a kind of completed
281.4,4.26,version based on
283.62,5.84,um the the problem that we've given it
285.66,3.8,so hopefully this will be done
289.8,6.0,I don't know how long it's going to go
291.54,6.24,this is very uh comprehensive this one
295.8,4.44,but yeah as I say this this is a
297.78,4.199,template so you can you can adapt this
300.24,3.6,um or you can use it for ideas this is
301.979,3.601,not going to be a finished thing
303.84,3.54,um or a finished project plan and it's
305.58,2.76,not gonna maybe apply to every type of
307.38,2.94,project
308.34,4.56,um you know you might want to type in
310.32,6.12,something like um create a project plan
312.9,6.0,in tabular form for a I don't know uh a
316.44,4.979,technology project or a finance project
318.9,4.68,or you could um you could even say
321.419,4.681,create a project plan with the columns
323.58,4.14,and then put them in quotation marks and
326.1,3.06,it will build it for you obviously in
327.72,2.94,that use case it's probably not going to
329.16,3.18,be quicker than just going into Excel as
330.66,2.759,an example but what I wanted to show you
332.34,2.94,here
333.419,3.84,um look we've got some context as well
335.28,3.3,if you wanted to look into it but what
337.259,3.0,you can also do and this is where the
338.58,3.899,speed comes in
340.259,3.901,um is you can select it or I've got
342.479,4.261,shift on my keyboard held down and I've
344.16,5.34,selected the whole table a control C and
346.74,4.62,if you go into Excel and Ctrl V
349.5,3.24,you'll see it's literally brought it in
351.36,3.54,with some formatting as well you've got
352.74,4.62,the gray kind of tabular
354.9,3.96,um for um formatting and then obviously
357.36,4.08,you can just change this by default it's
358.86,4.2,that so go fun we can change this to
361.44,3.18,collaborate as an example make it a bit
363.06,4.38,bigger you know you can you can change
364.62,4.5,with the formatting but you know you
367.44,4.02,have got a
369.12,3.84,um a product a basic project plan that
371.46,2.88,you can build from here you can get rid
372.96,3.48,of all the tasks and you could just have
374.34,4.02,the columns but yeah you could save this
376.44,3.12,up and work for me from here but I just
378.36,4.08,wanted to show you this because it is
379.56,4.259,useful chat gbt is developing I believe
382.44,2.34,they're going to release a new tool at
383.819,3.0,the moment it's a student's kind of
384.78,3.84,playground phase so yeah it's just a lot
386.819,3.181,of testing at the moment
388.62,4.199,um and it's not kind of fully available
390.0,4.44,to the public but it will get better and
392.819,4.38,in time who knows this could be much
394.44,4.199,more comprehensive from the outset so I
397.199,3.0,hope this video was useful if it was
398.639,2.761,please hit the like button that tells me
400.199,3.961,I should continue making videos like
401.4,4.2,this and do consider subscribing to the
404.16,2.52,channel if you get over to my channel
405.6,2.46,you'll notice there's very different
406.68,3.359,playlists
408.06,4.1,um all about project management whether
410.039,5.1,it's project management methodology
412.16,5.02,processes or building out templates like
415.139,3.9,product plans or risk registers as an
417.18,3.6,example and there's also some other
419.039,3.301,playlists on different tools as well
420.78,3.479,that project managers commonly use that
422.34,3.9,you may want to learn more about
424.259,4.28,so with all that said I hope you have an
426.24,2.299,excellent day
