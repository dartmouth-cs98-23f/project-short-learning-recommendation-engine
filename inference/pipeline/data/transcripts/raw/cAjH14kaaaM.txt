0.16,3.519,saint thomas aquinas the philosopher
2.08,4.799,argues that everything has an
3.679,5.441,essence an ideal at its core and
6.879,4.241,an existence an appearance and
9.12,3.76,manifestation in the real world
11.12,3.84,the only thing in the universe whose
12.88,3.36,essence and existence are identical
14.96,4.64,according to aquinas
16.24,5.199,is god anything else you me
19.6,3.36,this microphone and the scientific
21.439,4.961,discipline of hci
22.96,6.079,will have discrepancies between what is
26.4,4.959,essential and what is existential to it
29.039,4.481,human computer interaction or hci
31.359,4.561,for short is a phrase that we hear a lot
33.52,5.12,in the context of design innovation
35.92,4.959,computer science digital products it is
38.64,2.8,obviously very relevant to our lives
40.879,2.721,because
41.44,3.68,most of what we do today is basically
43.6,3.36,human computer interaction it's
45.12,2.88,literally what we do with most of our
46.96,3.2,waking hours
48.0,4.239,right now as i record this episode i am
50.16,3.76,interacting with multiple computers my
52.239,3.281,camera is actually a computer i'm
53.92,2.88,looking at my notes on some sort of
55.52,4.24,computer my phone
56.8,4.399,also a computer could ring at any time
59.76,3.599,and as you are
61.199,3.121,watching or listening to this episode
63.359,2.961,you are also
64.32,4.0,performing some kind of human computer
66.32,3.68,interaction even in our sleep we
68.32,2.159,interact with computers you know some of
70.0,2.56,us
70.479,3.521,measure our sleep with smart watches or
72.56,3.52,rings and most of us
74.0,3.119,actually wake up to some kind of digital
76.08,4.24,alarm clock
77.119,4.801,this phenomenon of hci the experience of
80.32,4.32,it is everywhere it is
81.92,4.96,the defining feature of human life today
84.64,2.72,this is hci as a phenomenon it's the
86.88,2.72,fact
87.36,4.32,that we live with computers and it's not
89.6,3.36,only these keyboard and mouse and screen
91.68,2.799,kind of things but
92.96,4.159,anything that involves digital
94.479,4.401,components your dishwasher your tv
97.119,4.0,your car but when you hear people
98.88,3.919,talking about hci it's probable that
101.119,4.081,they are not only talking about the
102.799,5.041,phenomenon of using a computer
105.2,4.64,but rather they are talking about a
107.84,4.08,profession or discipline which
109.84,4.16,deals with this phenomenon so human
111.92,4.879,computer interaction is the name of what
114.0,5.04,happens but it is also the name of the
116.799,4.561,scientific and professional field
119.04,4.0,where people have the job of analyzing
121.36,3.759,it and designing it
123.04,3.84,this the scientific and professional
125.119,3.12,discipline that is called hci
126.88,3.28,is what we're going to talk about in
128.239,3.921,this episode of design discipline
130.16,4.24,my name is mahmoud aidan baitash i'm a
132.16,5.04,scholar of design and technology and
134.4,5.199,research in hci is basically my job i
137.2,4.8,design and develop hci applications i
139.599,3.36,write about hci i manage research
142.0,3.28,projects i
142.959,4.0,teach hci at the university and i feel
145.28,3.12,incredibly privileged to be working in
146.959,2.64,this field because computers and the
148.4,3.839,ways that we use them
149.599,3.521,are essential to our lives hci is
152.239,3.441,basically
153.12,3.839,the defining feature of human life and
155.68,3.199,culture today
156.959,3.601,naturally there's a lot of interest in
158.879,2.881,hci as a profession
160.56,3.2,a lot of people are interested in
161.76,3.759,getting hci related jobs
163.76,3.04,companies are looking for hundreds of
165.519,3.761,different kinds of professionals that
166.8,4.799,have to do with computing and design and
169.28,4.0,user interfaces in the world of academic
171.599,3.681,research where getting funding is a
173.28,4.16,significant challenge for all of us
175.28,4.08,hci researchers are actually treated a
177.44,3.84,little more generously compared to our
179.36,2.799,colleagues in like social sciences or
181.28,3.2,the arts
182.159,3.041,however compared to the level of
184.48,2.88,interest
185.2,3.28,and the relevance of the phenomenon of
187.36,4.32,hci
188.48,4.56,the actual profession of hci is quite
191.68,3.6,small and it's quite
193.04,4.16,challenging to get into and the
195.28,2.8,challenge here is largely because a lot
197.2,3.44,of people
198.08,5.04,when they start out don't have a mental
200.64,5.04,model of hci as a scientific
203.12,3.36,field which has enough detail and enough
205.68,2.88,clarity
206.48,4.56,i'll give you an example around a year
208.56,3.84,ago i was involved in a university
211.04,4.08,project and i teamed up with two
212.4,5.919,professors and we had the job of hiring
215.12,5.6,two hci researchers we had two positions
218.319,4.961,for phd researchers and we got
220.72,3.28,more than 200 applications for these
223.28,2.56,positions
224.0,3.84,most of the people who applied were very
225.84,3.28,smart and very successful some of them
227.84,3.679,were great engineers
229.12,4.24,some were designers entrepreneurs and
231.519,4.241,different kinds of scientists
233.36,3.92,very smart people very cool skills and
235.76,4.08,experiences that they brought
237.28,4.08,but out of 200 people most of whom were
239.84,4.479,very impressive
241.36,5.28,there was only like 10 of them who
244.319,5.041,really understood the field of hci so
246.64,4.959,they all understood hci as a phenomenon
249.36,5.2,and most of them understood the
251.599,5.441,essential ideas the ideals of hci
254.56,4.56,as a scientific and professional field
257.04,2.96,but only around five percent of them
259.12,3.04,actually
260.0,3.6,understood like the boundaries and the
262.16,4.08,landscape of hci
263.6,3.599,in terms of its existential facts and
266.24,2.88,naturally
267.199,3.361,those people were the ones that we
269.12,3.04,interviewed for the jobs
270.56,3.44,so what i'm going to talk about now is
272.16,4.16,going to help those of you who are
274.0,3.84,interested in hci as a profession
276.32,3.439,especially those of you who are looking
277.84,4.4,at graduate studies and especially
279.759,4.401,phd programs in hci and there are two
282.24,3.92,reasons why we focus on this the first
284.16,2.96,is that a few days ago i actually posted
286.16,2.72,on twitter
287.12,4.48,asking the community for what questions
288.88,4.879,to cover in in this episode about hci
291.6,4.4,and one of the most salient requests was
293.759,5.041,to talk about how to get into hci
296.0,5.039,phd programs so with a shout out to
298.8,3.52,faria and others who submitted questions
301.039,3.921,we're going to talk about some of the
302.32,4.48,concepts you need for this exact purpose
304.96,3.44,the second reason why this is especially
306.8,3.76,relevant to phd studies
308.4,4.16,is that in fact even though the
310.56,5.199,phenomena of computers are
312.56,3.919,everywhere in our lives hci as a
315.759,3.28,profession
316.479,3.28,actually refers to a very particular
319.039,3.281,niche
319.759,3.121,within academic and scientific research
322.32,4.08,and this
322.88,7.44,is my first point there isn't really a
326.4,6.4,job or position that is called hci
330.32,4.0,which exists purely in the world of
332.8,3.119,business at companies
334.32,3.92,in this way it's different from other
335.919,4.321,jobs like being a programmer or engineer
338.24,3.84,or graphic designer or psychologist
340.24,2.72,because even though many universities
342.08,4.64,have
342.96,6.959,these programs where you can study hci
346.72,5.44,jobs like hci designer or hci
349.919,3.12,manager things like that don't really
352.16,2.64,exist
353.039,4.88,basically the only job where you would
354.8,4.48,have hci in your actual job title in an
357.919,4.641,actual company
359.28,4.8,is the job of a hci researcher and these
362.56,4.0,jobs are really rare
364.08,4.32,they basically exist only at these large
366.56,3.52,tech companies with big budgets for
368.4,3.68,innovation and research
370.08,3.92,in fact i went on linkedin to search for
372.08,2.32,these jobs and found only two of them
374.0,2.639,among
374.4,3.2,thousands of jobs on linkedin at
376.639,3.361,microsoft
377.6,4.0,and spotify and both of them list as
380.0,2.639,their requirements that you should have
381.6,2.319,a phd
382.639,2.961,and you should have published your
383.919,2.801,research at particular scientific
385.6,2.8,conferences and
386.72,3.44,journals and this is the first thing
388.4,4.56,that confuses people because the
390.16,4.4,essence or the ideal of hci is very
392.96,3.679,broad you know if you go to
394.56,3.84,any other resource like various books
396.639,3.521,and lectures and whatnot
398.4,4.079,usually they will hit you with a very
400.16,4.08,long and very complicated definition
402.479,4.081,wikipedia will tell you for example that
404.24,3.04,hci is a multi-disciplinary field of
406.56,2.56,study
407.28,3.84,based on the design and use of computer
409.12,3.68,technology in particular the interfaces
411.12,4.799,between computers and users
412.8,3.76,it's very broad it's very inclusive it's
415.919,4.0,trying to do
416.56,4.24,justice to all that hci is and all that
419.919,4.081,it could be
420.8,6.56,but the reality the existential fact
424.0,4.88,is that hci is the name of a very
427.36,4.64,particular niche
428.88,4.56,in scientific and academic research so
432.0,3.44,this is the first thing that you need to
433.44,3.52,understand if you're looking at hci as a
435.44,4.0,job it's the fact that
436.96,4.32,hci is a research discipline and
439.44,4.0,therefore it is subject to all of the
441.28,3.6,concerns and constraints that apply to
443.44,3.68,all kinds of
444.88,3.12,like scientific and academic research
447.12,2.72,disciplines
448.0,3.36,so if you want to become a hci
449.84,3.44,researcher you kind of have to be
451.36,2.959,interested in like the rigor and
453.28,3.359,philosophy of
454.319,4.481,science and academia you will need to
456.639,2.56,read thousands of research papers and
458.8,3.04,write
459.199,4.241,a lot of your own you need to engage
461.84,2.24,with the academic world with the
463.44,2.4,ecosystem
464.08,3.119,of like universities and academic
465.84,3.52,careers and
467.199,4.4,research funding and conferences and
469.36,4.0,journals you might have to teach courses
471.599,3.521,and give lectures and all of this is
473.36,3.76,actually going to take up most of your
475.12,4.0,time to the extent that you will have
477.12,5.199,very little time left to
479.12,5.519,create actual products most professional
482.319,3.921,hci researchers actually don't design
484.639,2.081,anything in a hands-on fashion they
486.24,2.56,don't
486.72,3.84,develop a lot of software now there are
488.8,4.079,exceptions to this for example there is
490.56,4.079,a hci research conference called user
492.879,2.801,interface software and technology or
494.639,3.28,uist
495.68,3.919,where a lot of technical and tactical
497.919,4.081,work is presented
499.599,4.401,and there are some design related venues
502.0,3.759,as well but on the vast majority of
504.0,2.0,these projects the people who are doing
505.759,2.481,this
506.0,4.16,hands-on work are actually graduate
508.24,4.64,students so it's only at the
510.16,4.799,earliest stages of this career where you
512.88,2.8,will actually get to do the hands-on
514.959,3.921,work
515.68,4.96,later as a professional hci researcher
518.88,3.519,you might be on a team where you
520.64,2.639,collaborate with people who do these
522.399,3.841,things
523.279,4.56,but your job will not be to design user
526.24,3.76,interfaces and to develop
527.839,4.56,different gadgets in fact your job as a
530.0,4.0,hci researcher is much closer to being
532.399,4.0,an analyst a critic
534.0,3.76,a teacher a philosopher and even a
536.399,3.761,project manager
537.76,3.6,much more than it is to being a designer
540.16,2.56,or developer
541.36,3.44,this is the first thing that you need to
542.72,3.92,clear up if you're interested in hci
544.8,3.92,as a profession a lot of people who
546.64,4.08,think they are interested in hci
548.72,3.84,are actually more interested in design
550.72,4.0,or development which are
552.56,4.0,different disciplines now these jobs do
554.72,3.36,have some overlap since they basically
556.56,2.399,deal with the same subject matter of
558.08,2.8,like
558.959,3.361,user interfaces they are definitely
560.88,3.6,related uh
562.32,4.079,researchers designers and developers
564.48,3.6,very often work together in teams
566.399,3.921,a lot of people switch between these
568.08,4.0,jobs at various points in their career
570.32,3.519,and you can definitely get an education
572.08,2.319,in one of these things and get a job in
573.839,2.961,the other
574.399,4.0,in fact if you study hci it will lead
576.8,3.28,you to a lot of different jobs in
578.399,2.321,product design or engineering or
580.08,2.96,marketing
580.72,3.36,sales user experience research but the
583.04,3.76,work that you would do
584.08,4.16,as a professional hci researcher is
586.8,2.159,different from those and it's very
588.24,3.12,specific
588.959,3.921,so what then is the actual work that a
591.36,3.44,hci researcher does
592.88,3.44,now the answer to this gets complicated
594.8,4.159,sometimes because
596.32,3.519,people in hci actually really love to
598.959,2.88,like debate
599.839,4.0,the boundaries and the philosophy of
601.839,4.081,what we do but after like 10 years of
603.839,4.24,wading through all of those debates
605.92,3.599,i believe that i have come to an answer
608.079,3.841,which is actually quite simple
609.519,4.0,the answer is that hci is part of
611.92,4.159,computer science
613.519,4.961,hci is the part of computer science
616.079,4.641,which builds on social sciences
618.48,3.52,and humanities so let's talk about the
620.72,4.239,two parts of this
622.0,4.399,first of all the idea that hci is a part
624.959,3.921,of computer science it's a
626.399,3.521,subset of computer science has to do
628.88,3.92,with the fact of
629.92,4.96,where it exists in practice the absolute
632.8,4.4,existential core of any scientific
634.88,5.28,discipline today is publications
637.2,4.72,any scientific field first of all exists
640.16,2.72,as a collection of written documents
641.92,3.599,it's
642.88,3.36,books or journal articles and conference
645.519,2.161,papers
646.24,4.08,and if you look at the conferences and
647.68,4.48,journals which define hci which are
650.32,3.04,truly the infrastructure for the
652.16,3.28,scientific community
653.36,3.28,these are produced by organizations
655.44,2.88,which define
656.64,3.6,themselves in terms of computer science
658.32,2.72,and engineering the two largest ones are
660.24,2.64,the acm
661.04,4.08,or the association for computing
662.88,4.399,machinery and ieee which is the
665.12,2.88,institute of electrical and electronics
667.279,3.361,engineers
668.0,5.12,now people do argue that hci extends
670.64,5.68,beyond computer science which it does
673.12,5.92,but my view is that when it does
676.32,4.72,it also extends the borders of computer
679.04,2.88,science it redefines what computer
681.04,3.2,science is
681.92,4.479,but all of this philosophy aside what
684.24,4.719,follows for practical purposes is that
686.399,4.081,being a hci researcher means that you
688.959,3.521,are a computer scientist
690.48,3.44,and if you are a computer scientist then
692.48,3.68,you will be expected to
693.92,4.0,command the knowledge and skills that a
696.16,2.56,competent computer scientist would
697.92,3.039,possess
698.72,4.08,even though in hci you might specialize
700.959,4.161,in methods and philosophies that come
702.8,4.4,from elsewhere as we will soon discuss
705.12,3.839,your work is most probably going to
707.2,3.6,involve computer science topics and you
708.959,2.641,will have to have the competence to deal
710.8,2.8,with these
711.6,4.16,like algorithms and data structures
713.6,4.0,information theory graphics signal
715.76,3.84,processing machine learning electronics
717.6,2.64,software engineering you can't avoid or
719.6,2.64,outsource
720.24,3.599,dealing with these topics as a hci
722.24,3.599,researcher you don't have to be an
723.839,3.841,expert on all of these but in order to
725.839,2.881,do your work you need to have a command
727.68,3.04,of the basics
728.72,4.239,and furthermore many professors and
730.72,3.84,other leaders who recruit for hci
732.959,2.961,related positions are themselves
734.56,3.6,computer scientists and
735.92,3.84,engineers so being able to speak the
738.16,3.6,same language as these people
739.76,4.24,will carry you forward in the hiring
741.76,5.12,process so that's my argument that for
744.0,5.12,a career in hci you really do need a
746.88,4.16,strong foundation in computer science
749.12,4.719,but there's one more thing you need
751.04,3.239,which is again a foundation and ideally
753.839,3.281,a
754.279,4.201,specialization in the social sciences
757.12,2.8,and the humanities
758.48,3.52,i'm not going to go too deep into the
759.92,3.599,history of hci which we might do in a
762.0,4.079,future episode but
763.519,4.12,very briefly the origin of hci as a
766.079,3.601,branch of computer science really
767.639,4.2,materializes in the 80s
769.68,4.08,there's a book from 1983 which really
771.839,3.68,stands out it's called the psychology of
773.76,3.44,human computer interaction
775.519,4.401,and basically what's happening here is
777.2,4.879,that the authors of this book are taking
779.92,3.84,assumptions methods results and
782.079,4.0,arguments from psychology
783.76,4.56,and from that they are deriving answers
786.079,4.481,about how to design computers so
788.32,4.72,they expand computer science and
790.56,4.959,psychology towards each other they
793.04,4.64,kick off this interdisciplinary field
795.519,3.681,called hci and over the years
797.68,3.36,what happens is that people start
799.2,2.48,bringing in other branches of social
801.04,3.359,sciences
801.68,4.719,and humanities into hci if you actually
804.399,3.761,get involved in hci you will see that
806.399,3.761,people talk about these three
808.16,3.2,waves or intellectual movements that
810.16,3.84,define its
811.36,4.24,its history and evolution psychology and
814.0,4.399,computer science coming together is the
815.6,4.799,first wave of hci the second wave
818.399,3.041,is the rest of the social sciences
820.399,2.8,coming into it
821.44,4.079,moving together with developments in
823.199,3.76,computer technologies and devices and of
825.519,3.601,course the internet
826.959,4.401,in order to deal with the new kinds of
829.12,4.0,like questions and possibilities that
831.36,4.159,come from this technology
833.12,4.159,we bring assumptions and methods from
835.519,4.32,disciplines like anthropology
837.279,3.601,and sociology and media studies and more
839.839,4.481,and we're
840.88,5.36,applying those to the phenomenon of hci
844.32,3.92,so gradually a lot of new ways of
846.24,3.76,thinking and doing research become
848.24,3.839,accepted in hci
850.0,4.0,the third wave of hci then is the same
852.079,3.681,thing happening with humanities
854.0,3.199,as technology and computers become
855.76,3.68,ingrained in our lives and the
857.199,4.161,incredible ways that we have today
859.44,3.28,it actually becomes possible and even
861.36,3.52,necessary to use
862.72,3.359,methods and philosophies from like
864.88,4.079,literature
866.079,3.681,philosophy critical theory arts and of
868.959,3.281,course
869.76,4.96,design in order to make sense of the
872.24,4.56,place and the possibilities of computers
874.72,4.559,in our lives having gone through these
876.8,4.32,movements hci today is a diverse and
879.279,3.041,inclusive branch of computer science
881.12,3.36,where we take
882.32,3.8,knowledge and methods or if you want to
884.48,4.32,be technical about it we take the
886.12,5.079,epistemologies and methodologies
888.8,3.76,from schools of thought which
891.199,2.401,traditionally have nothing to do with
892.56,3.04,computer science
893.6,3.84,and we use them to figure out how to
895.6,5.039,deal with all of this technology
897.44,5.12,it's a very fortunate very beautiful
900.639,2.721,place to be and having learned from this
902.56,4.32,history
903.36,6.88,hci today is a very uh tolerant very
906.88,5.199,inclusive place where ideals that
910.24,4.32,might not initially make sense to
912.079,4.56,computer scientists might get accepted
914.56,3.519,and this brings me to my final point
916.639,4.241,because this tolerance
918.079,4.721,and inclusivity is a double-edged sword
920.88,3.92,on one hand it allows us to consider
922.8,3.2,unconventional ideas it frees us from
924.8,3.76,prejudice and it paves
926.0,4.639,the way to innovation and invention not
928.56,3.199,to mention that it creates a beautiful
930.639,3.44,community where
931.759,3.841,all kinds of individuals are accepted on
934.079,2.241,the other hand it certainly makes it
935.6,2.88,difficult for
936.32,3.199,outsiders and beginners to make sense of
938.48,3.599,what we're doing
939.519,4.641,and it makes it difficult for us to have
942.079,4.721,standards and recognize really
944.16,4.32,high quality and really meaningful work
946.8,3.599,so what does this mean for someone who's
948.48,2.96,interested in joining the world of hci
950.399,3.12,well it means
951.44,4.079,that in addition to being a citizen of
953.519,2.961,the academic world and mastering its
955.519,2.801,rituals
956.48,3.279,in addition to being a competent
958.32,4.079,computer scientist
959.759,4.161,there is a third area of competence
962.399,3.68,which you need to command
963.92,3.12,and this is the social sciences and
966.079,2.801,humanities
967.04,3.28,now you don't need to be a master of the
968.88,3.199,entire landscape here although it
970.32,3.28,definitely pays off to have like
972.079,3.361,knowledge of the whole spectrum
973.6,3.84,but when you come into hci you should
975.44,4.24,come equipped with let's say
977.44,4.48,the equivalent of a university degree in
979.68,4.48,terms of your skill and competence in
981.92,3.76,one of those fields like psychology or
984.16,3.52,anthropology or
985.68,3.68,critical theory or sociology and of
987.68,3.44,course design
989.36,3.44,i know that this is a lot of work it
991.12,4.0,takes many years to cultivate this
992.8,3.52,competence in computer science as well
995.12,3.6,as let's say
996.32,4.959,anthropology and this exactly is the
998.72,4.4,reason why most hci schools are graduate
1001.279,4.321,level they are masters and phd
1003.12,4.959,programs because this gives you the time
1005.6,4.32,to cultivate these skills and also
1008.079,4.081,familiarize with the rest of the
1009.92,3.919,academic ecosystem in the previous years
1012.16,3.52,of your schooling but going back to the
1013.839,3.601,question of what you will need in hci if
1015.68,4.0,you have this combination of skills
1017.44,3.6,which is first of all an interest in
1019.68,4.96,academic research
1021.04,5.759,and then competence in computer science
1024.64,4.559,and then a branch of social sciences or
1026.799,4.481,humanities including but not limited to
1029.199,4.48,some kind of design discipline
1031.28,4.159,and maybe you can add to that the
1033.679,3.921,specific things that your project or
1035.439,4.161,your team might specialize in
1037.6,3.92,you will be unstoppable you'll have no
1039.6,3.599,problem getting into a hci program
1041.52,3.519,you'll have no problem going through it
1043.199,3.84,and you'll have no problem succeeding in
1045.039,2.721,the rest of your career as a hci
1047.039,2.721,professional
1047.76,4.24,if you've been looking at hci programs
1049.76,4.64,or maybe you're already in a hci school
1052.0,3.919,and you realize that there are parts of
1054.4,3.519,this combination of topics that you're
1055.919,3.681,not really super excited about that's
1057.919,3.601,actually totally fine you can
1059.6,3.84,find projects and team up with people
1061.52,4.159,where you focus on maybe software
1063.44,4.4,development maybe graphic design
1065.679,4.961,maybe ethnographic research whatever you
1067.84,4.719,enjoy simply realizing that hci is the
1070.64,3.44,name of a branch of computer science
1072.559,3.201,research which brings in the social
1074.08,3.839,sciences and humanities
1075.76,3.12,allows you to make sense of things and
1077.919,3.361,make faster
1078.88,3.6,and easier progress in future episodes
1081.28,3.759,of design discipline we're going to
1082.48,4.319,continue to explore the world of hci
1085.039,3.921,we have already had guests like joe
1086.799,2.721,fishkay and eric stoltharmon who have
1088.96,2.48,had
1089.52,3.92,a very successful and very different
1091.44,3.76,careers in this world we are gonna have
1093.44,3.04,many more conversations with people from
1095.2,3.44,the world of hci
1096.48,4.0,and we are going to talk about a lot of
1098.64,4.08,concepts from this world where
1100.48,3.04,design and technology and philosophy all
