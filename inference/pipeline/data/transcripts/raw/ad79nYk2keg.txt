0.4,4.72,picture this a machine that could
2.639,4.961,organize your cupboard just as you like
5.12,5.04,it or serve every member of the house a
7.6,5.2,customized cup of coffee makes your day
10.16,5.76,easier doesn't it these are the products
12.8,5.92,of artificial intelligence but why use
15.92,4.24,the term artificial intelligence well
18.72,3.04,these machines are artificially
20.16,4.56,incorporated with human-like
21.76,5.759,intelligence to perform tasks as we do
24.72,5.6,this intelligence is built using complex
27.519,5.921,algorithms and mathematical functions
30.32,6.399,but ai may not be as obvious as in the
33.44,6.16,previous examples in fact ai is used in
36.719,6.0,smartphones cars social media feeds
39.6,6.0,video games banking surveillance and
42.719,6.16,many other aspects of our daily life the
45.6,5.92,real question is what does an ai do at
48.879,5.601,its core here is a robot we built in our
51.52,4.96,lab which is now dropped onto a field in
54.48,4.399,spite of a variation in lighting
56.48,5.759,landscape and dimensions of the field
58.879,5.841,the ai robot must perform as expected
62.239,5.281,this ability to react appropriately to a
64.72,6.079,new situation is called generalized
67.52,6.32,learning the robot is now at a crossroad
70.799,5.441,one that is paved and the other rocky
73.84,5.04,the robot must determine which path to
76.24,5.36,take based on the circumstances this
78.88,5.279,portrays the robot's reasoning ability
81.6,4.879,after a short stroll the robot now
84.159,5.201,encounters a stream that it cannot swim
86.479,5.761,across using the plank provided as an
89.36,6.32,input the robot is able to cross this
92.24,6.16,stream so our robot uses the given input
95.68,5.36,and finds the solution for a problem
98.4,5.359,this is problem solving these three
101.04,5.52,capabilities make the robot artificially
103.759,5.68,intelligent in short ai provides
106.56,6.32,machines with the capability to adapt
109.439,6.32,reason and provide solutions
112.88,4.96,well now that we know what ai is let's
115.759,4.561,have a look at the two broad categories
117.84,6.319,an ais classified into
120.32,5.92,weak ai also called narrow ai focuses
124.159,4.96,solely on one task
126.24,5.84,for example alphago is a maestro of the
129.119,5.361,game go but you can't expect it to be
132.08,5.6,even remotely good at chess
134.48,5.92,this makes alphago a weak ai
137.68,5.52,you might say alexa is definitely not a
140.4,3.839,weak ai since it can perform multiple
143.2,3.92,tasks
144.239,5.841,well that's not really true when you ask
147.12,6.08,alexa to play despacito it picks up the
150.08,6.0,keywords play and despacito
153.2,5.36,and runs a program and is trained to
156.08,5.519,alexa cannot respond to a question it
158.56,5.679,isn't trained to answer for instance try
161.599,4.081,asking alexa the status of traffic from
164.239,3.201,work to home
165.68,5.12,alexa cannot provide you this
167.44,5.6,information as she is not trained to and
170.8,5.12,that brings us to our second category of
173.04,5.199,ai strong ai
175.92,4.88,now this is much like the robots that
178.239,5.201,only exist in fiction as of now
180.8,4.799,ultron from avengers is an ideal example
183.44,4.32,of a strong ai
185.599,4.881,that's because it's self-aware and
187.76,4.8,eventually even develops emotions
190.48,3.92,this makes the ai's response
192.56,4.24,unpredictable
194.4,4.559,you must be wondering well how is
196.8,4.64,artificial intelligence different from
198.959,5.441,machine learning and deep learning
201.44,6.0,we saw what ai is machine learning is a
204.4,5.759,technique to achieve ai and deep
207.44,3.76,learning in turn is a subset of machine
210.159,2.881,learning
211.2,4.08,machine learning provides a machine with
213.04,4.479,the capability to learn from data and
215.28,4.0,experience through algorithms
217.519,4.561,deep learning does this learning through
219.28,5.039,ways inspired by the human brain this
222.08,4.64,means through deep learning data and
224.319,5.041,patterns can be better perceived
226.72,5.36,ray kurzweil a well-known futurist
229.36,5.599,predicts that by the year 2045 we would
232.08,5.28,have robots as smart as humans
234.959,5.521,this is called the point of singularity
237.36,5.599,well that's not all in fact
240.48,5.759,elon musk predicts that the human mind
242.959,6.321,and body will be enhanced by ai implants
246.239,5.761,which would make us partly cyborgs
249.28,6.159,so here's a question for you which of
252.0,7.759,the below ai projects don't exist yet
255.439,6.721,a an ai robot with citizenship b a robot
259.759,5.921,with a muscular skeletal system
262.16,7.36,c ai that can read its owner's emotions
265.68,5.519,d ain't that develops emotions over time
269.52,3.6,give it a thought and leave your answers
271.199,4.081,in the comment section below
273.12,3.76,three lucky winners will receive amazon
275.28,4.24,gift vouchers
276.88,5.68,since the human brain is still a mystery
279.52,4.88,it's no surprise that ai2 has a lot of
282.56,4.56,unventured domains
284.4,5.2,for now ai is built to work with humans
287.12,4.4,and make our tasks easier
289.6,4.96,however with the maturation of
291.52,6.239,technology we can only wait and watch
294.56,5.68,what the future of ai holds for us
297.759,4.641,well that is artificial intelligence for
300.24,3.6,you in short do not forget to leave your
302.4,4.079,answer to the quiz in the comment
