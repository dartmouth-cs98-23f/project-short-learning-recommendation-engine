0.43,4.17,each year microsoft research helps
2.98,3.24,hundreds of influential speakers from
4.6,3.48,around the world including leading
6.22,3.84,scientists renowned experts in
8.08,3.9,technology book authors and leading
10.06,4.88,academics and makes videos of these
11.98,2.96,lectures freely available
22.05,8.41,um this is kind of a strange talk for me
27.25,4.35,to give two years ago I've done a lot of
30.46,3.39,things that Microsoft had been here a
31.6,5.19,long time and two years ago I got asked
33.85,4.68,to join the quantum computing effort and
36.79,4.38,I thought that in itself was kind of
38.53,3.959,strange because I'm not a researcher I'm
41.17,4.41,not a physicist I'm not a mathematician
42.489,5.191,I ship products you know I built a lot
45.58,4.92,of stuff and I write code I'm an
47.68,4.559,architect and wasn't quite sure what I
50.5,4.65,would do so I started looking around and
52.239,4.231,the first thing I look for tools I build
55.15,3.119,tools I try to make people more
56.47,4.439,productive and I started looking around
58.269,5.881,this whole field at what tools were
60.909,4.5,available and the answer was none there
64.15,2.67,was basically nothing out there
65.409,3.811,everybody would write what they needed
66.82,5.97,for their thesis get it done ship it and
69.22,6.0,throw it away so I started building a
72.79,4.41,platform and then I went around talking
75.22,3.509,to all the top names in the field what
77.2,3.9,would they do with a quantum computer if
78.729,4.741,they actually had one and it gave him
81.1,4.38,some sizes gave him some reason ille
83.47,4.53,technology and they all had things they
85.48,4.05,would do some pretty surprising but none
88.0,3.54,of them had an idea of how they would do
89.53,3.69,it so they knew they had problems to
91.54,4.8,solve but no one really had ways of
93.22,6.42,doing it so this talk is about trying to
96.34,6.36,fill some of that void it's a tool that
99.64,5.1,we've built that is evolving that we've
102.7,4.56,done some things further than anyone
104.74,4.35,else has ever done in the field I've
107.26,3.36,thrown back some slides that I've been
109.09,3.81,haven't used for the rest of this trip
110.62,4.53,because there's the first computer
112.9,3.509,science based group I've talked to
115.15,3.03,they've all been mathematicians and
116.409,3.181,experimental physicists and theoretical
118.18,3.66,physicists and I get to put some comp
119.59,4.35,side back in so hopefully some of those
121.84,7.679,slides will be interesting to the
123.94,7.17,audience but liquid is designed so that
129.519,5.761,we can create a simulation environment
131.11,6.15,um to make it easy to really complicated
135.28,6.35,quantum circuits and you'll see how
137.26,6.47,complicated in a little bit efficiency
141.63,4.02,a real problem if I could do quantum
143.73,5.25,simulation easily I would need a quantum
145.65,4.8,computer so how big can you go what can
148.98,2.94,you do on conventional hardware and how
150.45,2.97,efficient can you be and actually those
151.92,5.25,are the slides I threw back in to give
153.42,5.31,an idea of how hard that is circuits
157.17,4.41,have to retarget about for many purposes
158.73,4.23,um what I did is started in the middle
161.58,3.18,pretty much how you would for
162.96,4.29,conventional computer science I started
164.76,5.46,with an abstract idea of what a quantum
167.25,6.71,computer is logic gates that level and
170.22,6.39,then work my way up into circuits into
173.96,4.24,if you will assembly code equivalence
176.61,3.09,going up and find that we hit a language
178.2,3.6,at the top that you can actually express
179.7,4.59,in and compile down into that abstract
181.8,4.08,model we did that first now we're going
184.29,5.1,the other way from the abstract model
185.88,5.82,down into target hardware so noise what
189.39,4.17,things fall apart communications
191.7,3.45,limitations only certain things can talk
193.56,3.45,to certain things how do you compile
195.15,3.84,down into that how do you optimize for
197.01,5.21,actual experiments you're going to do in
198.99,6.42,the lab and machines are going to build
202.22,5.86,it turns out there's different ways you
205.41,4.74,can attack this because again you can't
208.08,4.44,do it all on conventional machine you
210.15,5.1,can pick specific things you're good at
212.52,6.36,you can be good at noise you can be good
215.25,4.74,at physical modeling you can be good at
218.88,2.79,circuit modeling so we've built
219.99,3.3,different simulators that all plug into
221.67,3.21,the same environment so you can write it
223.29,3.66,once and then run two different
224.88,5.04,simulations and trade things off and
226.95,4.92,then flexibility I'm an architect I like
229.92,3.87,platforms so how do you make it so you
231.87,3.96,can plug in your own modules change the
233.79,3.87,definitions extend this over time I
235.83,4.379,don't like things that are right and get
237.66,5.48,thrown away six months later so let's
240.209,10.771,talk about the platform itself yes
243.14,11.71,simulating go away how far away is the
250.98,5.129,real computer the one time where's about
254.85,3.72,we're going to talk a little bit about
256.109,4.231,one we can buy today okay so we're not
258.57,3.84,that far away in terms of what people
260.34,4.23,will tell you is a quantum computer and
262.41,5.27,the question is it is a paper that just
264.57,5.37,came out that we just did but
267.68,4.84,realistically to a real universal
269.94,5.1,quantum computer minimum 10 probably
272.52,3.0,closer to 20 years that's about the time
275.04,2.15,frame
275.52,4.519,talking about now pieces already exist
277.19,5.68,experiments exist demonstrations exist
280.039,4.241,but the real thing that lets say i put
282.87,3.509,up in the cloud you're going to connect
284.28,4.8,with azure and use it as a service and
286.379,6.151,run you know big simulations on 10 years
289.08,5.28,minimum the yuhl/goel here is the by the
292.53,3.419,time of their lives we want to be ready
294.36,3.63,to program well plus I need to program
295.949,3.84,it so I'd use this as the front end to
297.99,3.75,program it that's why there's the back
299.789,3.361,end right so by time you get used to
301.74,4.5,running the simulation you could also
303.15,5.16,instead target the real machine so we're
306.24,3.6,gonna start with the language I spoke to
308.31,3.81,don last night he said you've got to
309.84,3.87,push f sharp gotta push after Don always
312.12,5.76,says I've got to push so I've got my F
313.71,5.639,sharp mug here I'm one of the few people
317.88,3.529,he has to tell that to I've been using
319.349,5.1,since before it was version one
321.409,5.5,everything I've written in the last many
324.449,4.111,years has been in f-sharp and I'm a
326.909,4.32,functional programmer from way way back
328.56,4.74,so preaching to the choir here but I'll
331.229,4.051,show you why it's good why it works well
333.3,4.829,this is also why its language embedded
335.28,5.31,quantum operations think link this is a
338.129,3.811,monad that's been implemented inside of
340.59,4.079,the language and we've extended the
341.94,5.699,language in some nice ways but again
344.669,4.711,it's a dotnet language so you can come
347.639,3.241,it well it for F sharp can come from
349.38,2.879,scripting level in fact you don't have
350.88,3.36,to compile anything the whole thing
352.259,4.141,would be run from scripts which means we
354.24,4.44,can put this service you can just submit
356.4,3.69,the script you can come from C sharp or
358.68,3.359,any other language that can link with
360.09,4.319,the library so the whole thing is
362.039,4.891,contained in a library you can get to it
364.409,4.171,from any language you like it's just for
366.93,4.82,me the most natural and basically
368.58,6.179,designed for F sharp as the top level
371.75,5.77,everything compiles into gates when you
374.759,5.25,see gates think function so everything
377.52,3.929,has a definition a logical gate is just
380.009,3.75,you know a function that implements an
381.449,4.71,and or an oar or specific quantum gates
383.759,4.321,that we're going to talk about once this
386.159,3.69,all gets compiled it's gets sent to
388.08,4.47,simulators we have three simulators
389.849,4.741,currently the first is a universal
392.55,4.53,simulator this will do anything any
394.59,5.579,quantum computer we might build will do
397.08,6.269,but it comes at a price you can only do
400.169,7.071,on a typical 32 gigabyte laptop about
403.349,6.031,thirty cubits it's 2 to the 30th just
407.24,4.54,complex numbers to store
409.38,4.44,and then you have to operate on that so
411.78,4.8,you do the math you actually do pretty
413.82,5.13,well fitting into 32 gigabytes you want
416.58,5.18,another cubit double the memory you know
418.95,4.74,the cubit double the memory so i have a
421.76,4.57,simulation running right now this we're
423.69,4.23,going for 16 days that's running in a 96
426.33,4.05,gigabyte machine and that's nowhere near
427.92,5.01,big enough we actually have a bunch of
430.38,4.85,machines ordered that are a terabyte to
432.93,4.5,do a lot of the problems we want to do
435.23,4.09,but there's another way to go don't make
437.43,4.29,it universal get rid of a lot of the
439.32,6.27,gates that make it that complex to
441.72,5.49,simulate and there's a version of us of
445.59,3.66,the simulator uses only Clifford group
447.21,4.77,operations don't have to worry what that
449.25,4.8,is but they're called stabilizers the
451.98,5.55,interesting part is every quantum error
454.05,5.88,correction code only uses stabilizers so
457.53,4.92,you can do research into very
459.93,4.59,sophisticated quantum error correction
462.45,4.23,we'll talk about that a little later but
464.52,5.01,I can do tens of thousands of qubits as
466.68,3.96,soon as I don't make it Universal so
469.53,2.76,this is where you can trade off the
470.64,3.45,number of qubits versus the operations
472.29,3.87,you're allowed and then there's a
474.09,5.13,Hamiltonian simulator this lets you do
476.16,4.53,actual physics and it turns out a lot of
479.22,4.08,the types of machines we're talking
480.69,4.35,about depend very much on the actual
483.3,3.84,physics you can't just abstract it away
485.04,3.51,and are times you don't want to there
487.14,3.12,are things problems you'd like to set up
488.55,3.93,especially in machine learning that
490.26,4.65,require the actual hamiltonians again
492.48,4.8,this is universal again takes about
494.91,4.77,thirty cubits in 32 gigabytes but it's
497.28,4.32,slow so now you've traded off from the
499.68,4.17,universal to make it more physically
501.6,4.23,accurate now you have to run much slower
503.85,4.59,because you have to fix up all the
505.83,4.2,problems of basically doing a
508.44,8.13,differential equation that you're
510.03,8.34,solving along the way it buys you
516.57,3.09,physical modeling so for instance I can
518.37,3.33,actually do time derivatives I can
519.66,3.569,actually watch the times I actually say
521.7,3.9,spin glass problems we can do some of
523.229,4.741,these where I actually have to be
525.6,3.48,flipping key i'm doing a kneeling and to
527.97,2.97,do a kneeling up the drill to drop a
529.08,4.08,temperature and to drop the temperature
530.94,5.13,i have to actually do not each gate but
533.16,4.77,between each the the interactions
536.07,4.269,between all the gates over time as we go
537.93,5.98,from gate to gate
540.339,6.331,most physical simulation of the machine
543.91,4.109,yes but that doesn't change the appt
546.67,3.63,with each other well no it's not too I
548.019,3.961,the way no no if I'm doing annealing
550.3,2.969,right when you do a kneeling do similar
551.98,4.079,to kneeling on a regular classical
553.269,4.26,machine you have to break it up to do
556.059,3.27,time simulation right you're actually
557.529,3.18,going that's what the Hamiltonian will
559.329,3.81,do as opposed to saying if I just went
560.709,3.93,from here at a to be I lose all the
563.139,8.07,dynamics in between I won't get the
564.639,8.971,right answer right is doing the voltage
571.209,4.92,is actually different problem in coding
573.61,3.87,completely right and so we actually have
576.129,3.721,different ways of looking the problem
577.48,4.079,and liquid will let you write it once
579.85,5.179,and then send it to different ones and
581.559,8.88,see how they operate and how they work
585.029,6.641,yep whatever you'd like to define if you
590.439,3.421,know the physics you're doing a Trotter
591.67,4.05,ization and you get to pick the Trotter
593.86,4.32,number so if you want a thousand twenty
595.72,5.13,four steps between each and you want to
598.18,4.5,do the problem is I don't want to go too
600.85,4.469,far down this track but and we can do it
602.68,4.68,offline but the problem is the terms
605.319,3.81,that are in this equation aren't
607.36,3.959,commutative and you don't know what
609.129,3.481,order you actually have to have to
611.319,3.21,compute them in because they really want
612.61,4.409,to all be done in parallel so you have
614.529,4.53,to do is do five enough time steps to
617.019,3.48,get rid of the come utility the anti-com
619.059,3.57,you tivity problems and that's the
620.499,3.51,Trotter ization so by picking a finer
622.629,3.781,and finer cauterization get a more
624.009,3.93,accurate answer but each one is x is
626.41,3.06,twice as slow every time you had a
627.939,3.15,charter number it's twice as slow so
629.47,3.719,everything in this game is exponential
631.089,3.3,and you have to trade off very carefully
633.189,5.13,because things can take literally
634.389,5.82,forever run time so have 31 times
638.319,6.091,currently the client runtime this will
640.209,6.511,run on your laptop your desktop you just
644.41,6.179,bring it up put it in the script or
646.72,7.529,write the code it works service it's a
650.589,5.49,virus on purpose you sit there here in
654.249,4.53,the lab and you say I have accounts on
656.079,4.831,all those machines on my land it'll self
658.779,3.841,install itself across all of them it'll
660.91,3.179,become a windows service they'll all
662.62,3.719,look up and talk to each other now you
664.089,3.87,can run ensemble simulations across all
666.339,3.0,the machines in the lab and they have
667.959,4.771,them take themselves down and D install
669.339,4.771,nobody knows you were there there's
672.73,3.0,nothing to tune other than
674.11,3.21,xml file that says here are the machines
675.73,3.45,i have accounts on and here's where to
677.32,4.259,run the executable from everything else
679.18,4.68,is automatic and since we can do that we
681.579,4.291,can go to the cloud you have a cluster
683.86,4.32,you want to run an azure you hear you
685.87,4.08,submit a script it goes off pence ends
688.18,3.779,the script across to I don't know five
689.95,4.319,thousand machines does your ensemble
691.959,4.591,brings it back I'm using the word
694.269,4.981,ensemble because you don't ever break up
696.55,3.96,a computation across machines you'll see
699.25,2.79,why in a few minutes it's just too
700.51,3.389,inefficient there's no way you can
702.04,3.81,afford it but most of these are
703.899,3.721,statistical computations so you want to
705.85,3.179,run thousands of them anyway so you
707.62,3.089,might as well put one per machine and
709.029,4.62,then use all the threads available on
710.709,5.25,those machines but nice thing about F
713.649,4.471,sharp its introspective we have
715.959,3.601,reflection so we go download through all
718.12,4.05,these functions instead of running them
719.56,5.13,we have them describe themselves back we
722.17,3.78,build the AST we read the AST and we
724.69,3.72,actually create a data structure which
725.95,4.86,is now the circuit that r is represented
728.41,3.81,by all those functions once you have a
730.81,4.89,data structure we can do anything we
732.22,5.01,want to it we can optimize it and then
735.7,3.84,send it back down through the simulators
737.23,5.0,again we can do quantum error correction
739.54,5.58,we can apply just like you would do in
742.23,4.96,the classical case replace each one of
745.12,4.23,these gates with a error corrected
747.19,4.32,version that runs on multiple bits or in
749.35,4.32,this case qubits at the same time does
751.51,4.47,voting does correction fixes things up
753.67,7.38,based on error models we could do some
755.98,7.2,examples soul of a cat I of this most
761.05,3.99,your computations are rotations there
763.18,3.36,are things you want to move and the
765.04,3.9,problem is physical Hardware can only
766.54,5.19,let you usually move in certain discrete
768.94,4.35,rotations this lets you build equivalent
771.73,4.049,circuits that gets you to any exact
773.29,4.83,rotation you want by doing these course
775.779,5.401,ones along the way and so this will say
778.12,5.49,I need a 10 to the minus sixth accuracy
781.18,3.96,angle and this will put the thousand
783.61,2.849,gates together necessary and replace
785.14,3.12,that one angle with the gates you
786.459,3.75,actually have on the physical machine so
788.26,3.569,this is going down now from the abstract
790.209,5.581,level saying here the gates I actually
791.829,6.391,have replaced them all as needed noise
795.79,6.239,noise is a big problem we'll talk about
798.22,5.81,that in a little bit but if you look at
802.029,3.381,something quantum it falls apart
804.03,3.06,looking at it doesn't mean you looking
805.41,4.53,at it it means the environment
807.09,5.88,interacting with it things d co here no
809.94,5.67,matter what you do and so you have to be
812.97,3.75,able to handle that noise is the quantum
815.61,3.06,error correction but you also have to be
816.72,3.3,able to model it the simulation won't do
818.67,3.99,you much good unless you know what's
820.02,5.58,happening so there are different types
822.66,4.71,of noise bit flips phase flips just
825.6,4.29,bleeding of energy off to the
827.37,4.53,environment as things slowly d cojiro
829.89,3.57,over time all of that's modeled in the
831.9,2.94,system and you can apply that to all of
833.46,7.26,your circuits will show you what that
834.84,7.2,looks like oh yeah oh I'm going to be
840.72,4.11,doing details I need this is just to
842.04,4.53,show the architecture okay let's get
844.83,3.99,there okay so I'm going to just quickly
846.57,3.6,finish this export just let you take
848.82,3.87,these data circuits and send them to
850.17,4.44,backends we have two types classical we
852.69,3.24,have people of giant super computers and
854.61,2.55,want to be able to run this so we give
855.93,3.81,them in a form they can do linear
857.16,4.02,algebra and say go run and then quantum
859.74,3.06,as I mentioned you have a lab experiment
861.18,3.42,you actually want to output to control
862.8,3.51,that lab experiment and finally
864.6,3.83,rendering everybody hates drawing all
866.31,4.41,these circuits for technical journals
868.43,3.94,this draws them for you and you'll see
870.72,3.48,examples okay let's actually get into
872.37,3.69,things I'm going to skip the bit of F
874.2,4.14,sharp syntax I'm going to shoot su most
876.06,5.91,people in the room have an idea but you
878.34,7.26,know / ends our association arrays lists
881.97,5.13,how you call things you can pipe what no
885.6,3.63,looks like and then we've added some
887.1,3.69,operators so we've overloaded all the
889.23,3.39,usual math operators do complex
890.79,3.99,arithmetic nothing you wouldn't expect
892.62,4.5,we have chronic or products we have
894.78,6.36,vector matrix multiplies all these are
897.12,6.39,full precision complex operators there
901.14,4.74,are convenience operators that let you
903.51,3.93,for instance map one gate to a bunch of
905.88,2.91,qubits they do this gate on all these
907.44,4.47,qubits just things that make your life
908.79,4.98,easier um there's just some nice things
911.91,3.84,that say no matter what I have it's a
913.77,3.96,bag of stuff look in there four cubits
915.75,5.07,turn it into a legalistic cubits to use
917.73,4.65,so again convenience functions when I
920.82,4.17,talk gates this is what I'm talking
922.38,4.08,about so these are our bottom level
924.99,7.05,logical operations that we've been
926.46,6.96,talking so an X which is a flip in one
932.04,3.48,dimension so we're in three dimensions
933.42,4.46,here we can flip an X flip and why flip
935.52,4.91,and z so he's just saying flip this
937.88,4.5,state it's a vector in on a sphere and
940.43,6.02,we're flipping wherever it's pointing in
942.38,4.07,the X direction the Y direction of the Z
947.47,6.34,it is well it's a unit it's yes it's a
951.23,5.16,it's it's always unit and so it's only a
953.81,4.41,2 angles basically right where it sits
956.39,4.68,and so there's two complex numbers and
958.22,5.43,what the arch your pointing at is the
961.07,4.86,North Pole is 0 the South Pole is one
963.65,4.44,that's the basis here and you're just
965.93,4.29,giving the magnitude in each direction
968.09,3.87,in between those two complex which gives
970.22,4.53,you the phase as well and that's how
971.96,6.09,everything in the entire system looks is
974.75,5.64,this collection of complex numbers that
978.05,4.98,describe a state with all the qubits are
980.39,4.56,pointing in the 01 sphere in effect it's
983.03,2.94,actually gets more complicated as soon
984.95,3.0,as you have two of them you can't
985.97,6.24,actually visualize it but one that works
987.95,7.38,um but the matrix is what you have to do
992.21,4.89,that's what you multiply your your two
995.33,4.2,complex numbers by and if it's a one
997.1,4.41,cubit gate to get the output of applying
999.53,3.39,that gate so one of them flips it in one
1001.51,4.41,direction one room flips it along the
1002.92,4.95,imaginary axis one flips it along the in
1005.92,5.1,the other case the z axis the Z is the
1007.87,6.41,North Pole and South Pole so zero is
1011.02,7.95,this way and one is that way um
1014.28,6.22,everything including Z down z str4 our
1018.97,4.23,examples of rotations that are going
1020.5,4.439,half an angle further each time so Z
1023.2,5.46,we're flipping the whole way as for
1024.939,5.13,moving half t one quarter one-eighth and
1028.66,3.0,you can do as many as you want but just
1030.069,2.941,showing that's what the rotations
1031.66,3.6,they're just the bottom corner going
1033.01,5.49,higher and higher or smaller and smaller
1035.26,4.98,in terms of the value identity why do
1038.5,4.17,you need identity you multiply you get
1040.24,4.5,the same thing out for noise things that
1042.67,3.57,just sit there go bad over time so you
1044.74,4.65,want to be able to insert identities and
1046.24,4.86,watch them going bad hadamard is what
1049.39,3.48,gives you super position if I put in
1051.1,4.41,somebody who is pointing at the North
1052.87,4.38,Pole his value is zero and I run them
1055.51,3.36,through a hadamard I get somebody who's
1057.25,4.08,half pointing at zero half pointing at
1058.87,4.05,one he's in superposition so the
1061.33,3.93,difference here is think of as a
1062.92,3.78,probabilistic bit you can have it
1065.26,3.78,anywhere between zero and one with a
1066.7,4.41,probability the reason it's more than
1069.04,2.76,just that it also has a phase so you can
1071.11,2.28,point to anywhere
1071.8,8.34,the sphere we're straight-up would be
1073.39,12.06,zero straight down would be one they are
1080.14,7.05,yes okay and in effect they're actually
1085.45,3.51,in all that it's when you read when you
1087.19,3.21,try to look at it you get a probability
1088.96,3.09,of seeing the zero or seeing the one
1090.4,3.72,they become probability when you look at
1092.05,4.89,them they're actually wave functions if
1094.12,4.26,you want to be exact the equivalent of
1096.94,2.88,in-class compute you have an and gate
1098.38,3.48,and build everything out of NAND gates
1099.82,3.9,here you have a see not so controlled
1101.86,3.54,not if the top is a zero the bottom goes
1103.72,3.48,through unchanged at the top is a one
1105.4,5.13,the bottom gets flipped that's the
1107.2,4.86,controlled not but remember it's some
1110.53,3.63,probability in some directions it's a
1112.06,3.57,combination of 0 1 and that passes
1114.16,4.62,through and get a combination of the
1115.63,5.46,controlled not out the other end swap
1118.78,4.56,flips the values measure is how you get
1121.09,3.93,actual conventional data out you put a
1123.34,3.18,qubit in you measure it and with those
1125.02,4.08,probabilities you're either going to
1126.52,4.14,only get a 0 or a 1 out you get a bit
1129.1,4.5,and that's how you collapse everything
1130.66,4.59,down to a bit you can of course use a
1133.6,3.0,bit to say whether or not to do a gate
1135.25,3.99,so what you'll see when you see the
1136.6,4.41,double bar that means it's a bit so
1139.24,4.2,there's a bit on top of that X that says
1141.01,5.61,if it's a 1 do the X if it's a zero
1143.44,5.37,don't do the X and then finally I want
1146.62,5.73,to create a qubit i put in a binary
1148.81,5.52,value in this case 0 and I get a qubit
1152.35,3.57,back out the other end so these this is
1154.33,3.0,pretty much with the zoo at the bottom
1155.92,3.21,looks like you just want to give a feel
1157.33,5.49,for what you're going to see on other
1159.13,5.46,diagrams all of these are unitary
1162.82,3.99,operators except for the last three
1164.59,4.2,unitary means when I pass them through
1166.81,3.39,in one direction I can play them back in
1168.79,4.53,the other direction and I get the same
1170.2,5.61,thing I started with so every quantum
1173.32,5.25,circuit you see outside of when we
1175.81,3.93,measure is playable all the way from the
1178.57,2.85,beginning to the end and from the end
1179.74,4.5,all the way back to the beginning always
1181.42,4.92,and there are a number of things that
1184.24,4.94,does for you in natural physical side
1186.34,5.34,there's no heat dissipation it actually
1189.18,4.39,takes no energy to do this you're
1191.68,3.6,running super conductive and everything
1193.57,4.47,stays in a superposition but what it
1195.28,4.44,also means if I had an and gate can't
1198.04,3.03,actually do an and gate because you lose
1199.72,3.72,information when you go through the end
1201.07,3.75,so you have to do two wires one is
1203.44,2.07,actually the end and the others the
1204.82,2.64,information
1205.51,3.99,it back if you go the other way and
1207.46,3.45,that's why all of these look like this
1209.5,4.86,with the matrices because you can run
1210.91,4.98,them in either direction okay hello
1214.36,3.39,world is what we would do for the
1215.89,4.47,canonical example for conventional let's
1217.75,6.3,do the canonical hello world for quantum
1220.36,5.7,which is called teleport Alice and
1224.05,3.51,tangles two qubits so we have two qubits
1226.06,3.66,on the Left starting in zero we're going
1227.56,4.43,to superimpose the one qubit so he's
1229.72,4.95,between zero and one the controlled not
1231.99,5.73,entangles them together so this is
1234.67,6.33,called an epr gate or an epr circuit
1237.72,6.07,Einstein Podolsky Rosen I always get it
1241.0,4.59,wrong but all it means we have two
1243.79,3.72,qubits that are maximally entangled at
1245.59,4.05,this point they completely share mutual
1247.51,3.99,information we somebody wants all flat
1249.64,5.49,explain all the math and how it all goes
1251.5,4.74,together but Bob is going to take one of
1255.13,4.91,the cuba's to the other side of the
1256.24,6.51,universe ok Bob walks away with this guy
1260.04,5.59,alice is given a qubit with a message on
1262.75,4.88,it it's somewhere on that that sphere we
1265.63,4.29,talked about a vector pointing somewhere
1267.63,5.95,she entangles it with the qubit she
1269.92,5.16,still has and then she's going to
1273.58,3.47,measure both qubits know what I should
1275.08,4.59,mention is as soon as she entangled it
1277.05,5.29,Bob's qubit changed no matter where he
1279.67,5.22,is in the universe and he actually has
1282.34,5.28,the answer but it turns out he can't see
1284.89,4.32,it the answer is encoded in a way
1287.62,3.57,there's no way so we didn't it looks
1289.21,3.48,like we broke relativity that we can go
1291.19,2.52,faster than the speed of light and take
1292.69,2.61,this thing from one end of the universe
1293.71,3.89,and send it to the other but the
1295.3,4.98,information hasn't been transferred yet
1297.6,4.66,the state of the qubit changed but you
1300.28,4.5,can't do anything with it until she
1302.26,6.12,actually reads out the state of her two
1304.78,4.98,qubits trance them but transmits them by
1308.38,2.79,a classical channel which means now
1309.76,2.85,she's got to send these two bits across
1311.17,7.26,the universe we're back to the speed of
1312.61,7.92,light and then Bob can use it to decode
1318.43,4.32,the qubit those two bits are enough to
1320.53,4.29,get back an infinitely accurate
1322.75,3.36,representation of what was put in so he
1324.82,2.64,was able to transfer a lot of
1326.11,4.89,information but he still needed those
1327.46,5.25,two bits to get it back out don't worry
1331.0,3.24,about what it all means what I'm trying
1332.71,4.26,to show is the way these circuits work
1334.24,4.44,they look like a staff of music each one
1336.97,3.66,is a qubit you
1338.68,4.41,gates on or between them along the way
1340.63,4.02,and everything moves left to right this
1343.09,3.78,is how you draw a circus this is how the
1344.65,3.87,gates look in them and this is believe
1346.87,5.16,it or not about the simplest example you
1348.52,5.85,can do our Bob recovers the sent message
1352.03,4.71,and everybody's happy let's actually
1354.37,4.02,look at the f-sharp code okay again I'm
1356.74,3.27,not going to detail this isn't a course
1358.39,2.97,on quantum computing I'm trying just
1360.01,3.12,give a feel for what this looks like
1361.36,3.48,when you play with it I should also
1363.13,3.03,mention I didn't draw this circuit when
1364.84,3.15,you write the code the circuit comes out
1366.16,6.69,automatically so everything gets
1367.99,7.26,rendered for you as you go so that epr
1372.85,4.32,circuit is just an f-sharp function it
1375.25,3.81,takes a list of qubits for it's a
1377.17,3.3,hadamard on the first element in the
1379.06,3.06,list and a controlled not on the first
1380.47,3.54,two elements of the list so you can hand
1382.12,3.69,in variable lists and all the gates
1384.01,5.16,operate on however many qubits they need
1385.81,4.92,from the top of the list the actual the
1389.17,3.06,rest of the algorithm teleports a
1390.73,4.59,function I'm going to name the first
1392.23,6.24,three cubits in the list I'm do an epr
1395.32,5.49,function on q1 and q2 see not the first
1398.47,4.41,two and how to marred measure it by a
1400.81,4.68,control it measure it binary control it
1402.88,4.62,and there's the circuit so it's not a
1405.49,3.54,lot of code you can very quickly build
1407.5,4.05,these up and of course each one of these
1409.03,4.32,you build is a gate or is a function and
1411.55,4.56,so you can build them all the way up as
1413.35,4.14,deep as you like there's also some soo
1416.11,3.48,degay pseudo gate so I can put little
1417.49,4.26,labels like the source and the zero and
1419.59,4.62,the destination on there I can do some
1421.75,5.28,simple optimization fold says move
1424.21,4.89,everybody to the left that doesn't hit
1427.03,4.38,someone else this is things you could do
1429.1,3.87,in parallel in a machine and now
1431.41,3.42,everything lines up nicely looks
1432.97,3.99,prettier if you're doing a journal
1434.83,4.74,article instead of saying giving me SVG
1436.96,5.01,code in HTML you can say now give me
1439.57,4.77,latex source and so this is Q circuit
1441.97,4.29,output inlay tech so every paper we've
1444.34,5.54,been publishing it just auto generated
1446.26,7.98,by the simulator all the circuits we do
1449.88,5.89,now this is this the slides I threw back
1454.24,3.27,in for this audience just to show you
1455.77,6.09,what it takes to do this on the computer
1457.51,6.66,science side so we have these gates the
1461.86,4.62,gate is a unitary operator that's 2 to
1464.17,4.98,the N by 2 to the N and so if you have n
1466.48,5.39,qubits that's 2 to the 30th by 2 to the
1469.15,4.82,30th it's big the state vector
1471.87,4.89,keeping track of all of these qubits is
1473.97,4.62,also 2 to the 30th in size you multiply
1476.76,3.48,each of these gates by that so if you do
1478.59,3.719,this it's extremely inefficient takes
1480.24,3.99,ridiculous amounts of memory it's not
1482.309,3.451,pretty you run out of simulation address
1484.23,5.76,quickly you run out of memory quickly
1485.76,8.549,everything just goes bad the state
1489.99,5.7,itself only gets that big when qubits
1494.309,3.241,are entangled like we showed in the
1495.69,3.36,teleport example so if things are in
1497.55,2.79,registers they're separate from each
1499.05,2.67,other you really don't need that big a
1500.34,3.24,vector you'll have to keep the things
1501.72,3.9,that are entangled together other things
1503.58,3.99,that are separated or very small when
1505.62,4.98,you start out with 30 cubits it only
1507.57,5.03,takes 30 memory elements the entangle
1510.6,4.59,two of them those two just became for
1512.6,6.52,entangle that with another two that
1515.19,5.34,becomes 16 and so that if you keep track
1519.12,4.05,of the entanglement you can be very
1520.53,4.32,efficient about the size but you can't
1523.17,3.0,compress it further it's dense at that
1524.85,4.47,point there's nothing else you can do
1526.17,11.1,with it the operator is really sparse
1529.32,15.48,may just have these yep probabilistic
1537.27,9.24,way and when we're doing inference and
1544.8,4.74,machine learning context in very large
1546.51,5.4,state spaces somehow we always never try
1549.54,6.96,and actually represent every possible
1551.91,6.24,state exactly and I guess it's certainly
1556.5,4.17,if there are known in dependencies
1558.15,6.36,between the levels of qubits and we
1560.67,6.15,factor that's a way of reducing and the
1564.51,4.56,state start easy but then nice people
1566.82,4.65,often use approximations that can be
1569.07,5.43,extremely accurate can't do it here and
1571.47,4.92,the problem is it's not probabilistic
1574.5,4.74,it's fully deterministic until you
1576.39,6.03,measure it and those effects can be
1579.24,4.89,extremely fine grained you don't know to
1582.42,3.36,the end what you can approximate there
1584.13,3.69,is nothing you can approximate is where
1585.78,3.96,you fall apart here let me I did large
1587.82,4.23,scale you know machine learning for
1589.74,3.75,years and that was great now I can take
1592.05,4.379,massive problems and you know the size
1593.49,4.62,of the web right and bring them down and
1596.429,3.331,here you don't have the luxury you
1598.11,3.569,actually have to keep every you know
1599.76,4.26,full precision complex number all the
1601.679,4.041,way to the end and then you can actually
1604.02,4.19,measure it out probably in throat
1605.72,4.59,away but you don't know until the end
1608.21,3.6,because you're actually keeping all the
1610.31,4.35,fine grain interactions you don't know
1611.81,5.01,which ones are important and so it's
1614.66,3.3,frustrating as hell but if you really
1616.82,2.79,want to similarly what goes on in the
1617.96,4.77,machine you can't throw it away that's
1619.61,7.11,sort of the bottom line we can talk
1622.73,5.91,about it if you like okay yeah so the
1626.72,6.15,prop you have a really sparse operator
1628.64,6.39,but again it's its massive and it's hard
1632.87,3.87,to keep track of and remember even if
1635.03,3.36,I've got a little gate I have to expand
1636.74,5.16,it out to the size of the state vector
1638.39,6.69,to multiply the two so I have even for
1641.9,5.58,little gates I have the same problem so
1645.08,4.14,when act to the standard talk this is
1647.48,3.36,just F sharp code so we put it in a
1649.22,3.42,classical rapper you call the function
1650.84,4.98,just like any other phone classical
1652.64,5.55,function in here every top initial one
1655.82,5.19,is a random state vector we started with
1658.19,5.58,Simon's question there's your magnitudes
1661.01,4.5,on the complex number on zero the
1663.77,4.38,complex number on one saying where that
1665.51,4.53,vector is in the sphere we go through we
1668.15,4.41,read out the bits that says whether do
1670.04,3.99,the X or the Z flip and lo and behold we
1672.56,3.09,get the same vectors back out you know
1674.03,3.9,hello world works this is the equivalent
1675.65,3.96,of you run it through comes out you get
1677.93,3.86,in hello world everything worked your
1679.61,5.76,simulator actually does something useful
1681.79,6.01,this can also be run as a script so
1685.37,5.25,you've got multiple options you can just
1687.8,6.42,run FSI directly on the script and say
1690.62,6.12,do it you can do a use which lets you
1694.22,4.41,stay in the simulator after it runs you
1696.74,4.05,can look at the states and the values
1698.63,3.78,and all of that you can have liquid run
1700.79,3.72,it for you which will take the script
1702.41,4.29,compile it into a dll and then reload
1704.51,4.29,the dll back in of course now you have a
1706.7,4.08,dll s you can also run the dll directly
1708.8,4.2,it's got lots of options from a script
1710.78,4.8,level if you don't want to actually get
1713.0,3.99,into visual studio environment i said i
1715.58,3.48,wanted to make this fully extensible
1716.99,4.83,here's the actual controlled not gate
1719.06,3.99,this is all the code for it everything
1721.82,3.81,that's in here can be rewritten by the
1723.05,5.91,user can be extended they replaced and
1725.63,5.16,so you have a name for it some help you
1728.96,3.27,have a sparse matrix definition that
1730.79,3.18,says here are those elements of the
1732.23,5.04,matrix I showed you on the earlier slide
1733.97,5.64,and drawing is the latex commands for Q
1737.27,4.409,circuit parameterised so you can say
1739.61,4.59,put this on this cubic but this here
1741.679,4.38,here's how I want to drawn and that's it
1744.2,7.08,so that's all you need to do to do a
1746.059,6.99,gate I also said you could take those
1751.28,3.39,same functions and turn them to circuits
1753.049,3.331,this is how you do it into a data
1754.67,4.139,structure a circuit compile of the
1756.38,4.26,teleport function give it some cubits if
1758.809,5.131,I say dump the data structure back out
1760.64,4.86,you get back out a definition of all the
1763.94,4.109,different gates that were in teleport
1765.5,3.929,what matrices what wires there on and
1768.049,3.061,then from this you can go to anything
1769.429,5.341,you like and go a supercomputer you can
1771.11,5.069,go to actual control of a system you
1774.77,3.45,just want to show you how compact this
1776.179,3.961,can be this is an entanglement test that
1778.22,3.66,says superimpose one cubit and then
1780.14,3.6,entangle it with everybody and then
1781.88,3.78,measure them all well since everybody's
1783.74,3.21,fully untangled if I look at one of them
1785.66,5.07,they're all going to collapse to the
1786.95,4.88,same thing so if you look we get with
1790.73,3.27,about fifty percent probability
1791.83,3.61,sometimes we'll get zeros sometimes we
1794.0,3.03,get ones no matter which one you looked
1795.44,4.979,at first all the others collapse to the
1797.03,5.01,same thing to generate that circuit we
1800.419,4.64,created a function that just said
1802.04,5.85,Hadamard the first qubit remember him
1805.059,4.661,mapped to the tale a scene up between
1807.89,4.35,him and everyone else and then map a
1809.72,4.77,measurement across all the qubits so you
1812.24,6.45,get very complex very quickly with very
1814.49,5.49,small amount of code parallel version
1818.69,3.15,this is a little more complicated
1819.98,3.66,version that I said fold it and now
1821.84,3.6,everybody moves in time the 48th time
1823.64,3.93,steps really only takes ten time steps
1825.44,4.41,to execute so you do analyses of
1827.57,4.109,sequential versus parallel times on a
1829.85,4.35,target computer and see what it would
1831.679,4.861,look like this is the actual F sharp
1834.2,4.59,code not going to go into it in waiting
1836.54,3.69,is interested I can I can explain the
1838.79,3.509,lines but that's how we generated the
1840.23,4.53,previous circuit and this is it running
1842.299,4.141,so this is 20 entangled qubits takes
1844.76,3.87,about two seconds that's in the brackets
1846.44,4.35,each time we get all zeros and all ones
1848.63,4.74,as we'd expect this is running on my
1850.79,6.12,cluster so anywhere from 80 to 100
1853.37,5.429,percent utilization that took a thousand
1856.91,3.3,runs of 22 entangle qubits in three and
1858.799,3.801,a half minutes so now we're starting to
1860.21,7.26,get into some more interesting scaling
1862.6,6.22,it yeah yeah this is all Universal only
1867.47,4.709,talking Universal at this point so this
1868.82,4.14,you can do anything in this one um well
1872.179,1.98,let's do some
1872.96,3.48,thing that everyone knows Shor's
1874.159,4.201,algorithm let's factor okay that's it
1876.44,3.45,soon as you say quantum everybody says
1878.36,4.83,oh we're going to break our essay and
1879.89,6.0,not so much but this is a simple circuit
1883.19,4.44,I should say the biggest number you see
1885.89,5.73,in any of the published papers factoring
1887.63,7.32,is the number 15 okay four bits four
1891.62,6.419,cubits in this case as a 4-bit number
1894.95,6.3,takes eight nine ten eleven cubits to do
1898.039,4.321,the circuits actually 8200 gates one of
1901.25,2.64,the nice things about the circuit
1902.36,3.51,renderers you can say give me different
1903.89,4.649,levels like this is a more abstract
1905.87,4.86,level i have mutt modular multipliers
1908.539,3.75,here as units I could say go inside of
1910.73,5.13,those show me the circuits go inside of
1912.289,5.25,those and go at any level you like but
1915.86,3.12,like I said four bits ad tourniquet
1917.539,3.811,that's about what everyone's done we've
1918.98,4.559,done 13 bits which was the number 8189
1921.35,3.75,it's about half a million gates and the
1923.539,3.901,one running at home I think I mentioned
1925.1,4.65,at the beginning we'll go for 28 days
1927.44,7.29,and he's doing for a 14 bit number at
1929.75,6.6,the moment just to show you what the
1934.73,4.38,circuits look like this is the modular
1936.35,4.41,adder you have sharp code I won't do it
1939.11,3.9,in detail but there's a controlled
1940.76,4.44,controlled Adgate so here's the problem
1943.01,3.389,you want to add two numbers together and
1945.2,4.41,you want to keep them from overflowing
1946.399,5.971,it's a modular adder simple except the
1949.61,4.26,entire circuit has to be reversible as I
1952.37,4.32,said earlier everything has to be kept
1953.87,4.47,unitary so here we do the controlled
1956.69,4.44,control dad and we're actually doing
1958.34,4.62,this in Fourier space so now that we've
1961.13,4.11,done the ad we have to bring it back out
1962.96,6.3,we do an inverse excuse me this is the
1965.24,5.7,yeah this is the inverse of the no it's
1969.26,3.36,not the QFT this is an ad oh I'm sorry
1970.94,3.78,we're going to subtract off the number
1972.62,3.99,that we're modding to see if we over
1974.72,4.77,float or not so we subtract the number
1976.61,5.25,off now we take it out of Fourier space
1979.49,4.74,we do an inverse QFT quantum Fourier
1981.86,4.74,transform and we remember the top bit if
1984.23,3.929,the top bit overflowed we know we have
1986.6,4.23,to go back the other way otherwise we
1988.159,5.101,don't so we remember the bit in an Ansel
1990.83,4.8,ax or the qubit in this case now we put
1993.26,3.899,it back in the QFT now we really do the
1995.63,4.56,ad based on whether we would have
1997.159,5.461,overflowed if we had done the ad so this
2000.19,3.75,did the modular ad and now the whole
2002.62,3.45,rest of the circuit we're going to an
2003.94,2.67,inverse add inverse QFT we're going to
2006.07,2.04,clear
2006.61,4.26,top cubit we have to leave everything
2008.11,5.43,back the way we found it so he's got to
2010.87,5.7,go back to being a zero now we QFT now
2013.54,4.29,we add again and now we're done and you
2016.57,2.64,can run this circuit forward and
2017.83,2.58,backward and everything is left in the
2019.21,3.45,right state and everything works
2020.41,3.84,correctly but this is why it's not as
2022.66,3.09,trivial as just say take your classical
2024.25,3.66,algorithm and drop it into a quantum
2025.75,3.809,algorithm either we are working on that
2027.91,2.94,also someone else has a simulator
2029.559,2.701,they've written where you take a
2030.85,3.48,classical algorithms say make this
2032.26,4.62,reversible then take that reversible
2034.33,4.2,algorithm make it quantum so we're going
2036.88,2.94,to be adding that that's higher level
2038.53,4.38,things we're adding to the simulator
2039.82,6.54,over time okay so what do we get when we
2042.91,5.31,do this here's an example of factoring
2046.36,3.42,all sorts of numbers times they took
2048.22,5.28,probably much easier to look on a graph
2049.78,5.7,the blue diamonds are the first version
2053.5,6.6,of the simulator we wrote second version
2055.48,7.29,is the red and the orange is as of two
2060.1,5.85,weeks ago so we went from three years to
2062.77,4.649,four months 24 days to do that 13 bit
2065.95,3.449,number and as I said the one that's
2067.419,3.51,factoring at home the red line would be
2069.399,4.441,a month it looks like this will be about
2070.929,5.101,28 days to factor for the last one and
2073.84,4.26,that's not anybody cares that's you know
2076.03,4.92,my dog can talk not how well my dog can
2078.1,4.829,talk but again most everything published
2080.95,4.35,to this date has been way down all the
2082.929,4.561,way at the lowest on the left is the
2085.3,3.3,biggest anyone's done before this so
2087.49,3.0,this just gives you an idea the
2088.6,7.799,complexity of the full Universal
2090.49,8.04,simulator what you're able to do the
2096.399,3.481,promise of factoring big numbers my
2098.53,3.81,using gotomeeting we could do it way
2099.88,5.19,faster than we could an orderly computer
2102.34,4.35,mm-hmm however I was here factoring a
2105.07,3.539,yahoo could be done really fast so
2106.69,6.99,there's a really very normal slow down
2108.609,6.031,factor for so between so the promises
2113.68,3.78,the corner beauty is going to be
2114.64,4.05,fantastically much faster yes here it's
2117.46,2.88,kind of like taking months to do
2118.69,3.12,something oh no no but this is do this
2120.34,3.3,is doing a simulation of a simulation of
2121.81,3.98,a simulation so the real quantum
2123.64,4.5,computer will do this blindingly fast
2125.79,3.61,okay I'm doing all half a million gates
2128.14,3.36,and having do them on a classical
2129.4,3.719,machine to simulate them if I actually
2131.5,3.0,was doing this I can do this on a
2133.119,3.331,quantum computer that's actually not the
2134.5,3.3,prime very fact I can break our essay on
2136.45,3.659,a chronic Peter the problem is the
2137.8,4.559,number of qubits it takes
2140.109,4.2,number of gates it takes to fix up all
2142.359,6.63,the noise along the way to get there and
2144.309,6.27,on and on us when you actually yeah and
2148.989,2.82,so for some and i'm going to show you
2150.579,3.901,places where it's not where we actually
2151.809,5.401,do get an exponential win but factoring
2154.48,4.529,works but the actual technology you need
2157.21,3.629,to build the machine is a good 20-30
2159.009,3.36,years away before you could really build
2160.839,3.091,the machine to break our essay and by
2162.369,3.091,then RSA is bigger or whatever you're
2163.93,3.99,going to use for cryptography there is
2165.46,4.47,also quantum cryptography by the way you
2167.92,3.359,can really nicely entangle those qubits
2169.93,3.809,like we just showed you with Bob and
2171.279,5.79,Alice and if anyone eavesdrops on it you
2173.739,5.04,destroy it so anybody trying to look at
2177.069,3.121,the channel will destroy the channel so
2178.779,3.09,you can't get the information without
2180.19,3.329,somebody knowing and then they can't get
2181.869,3.781,the key because the key was moved
2183.519,5.611,quantumly and on and as a whole quantum
2185.65,6.06,key cryptography area to UM so let's
2189.13,4.139,talk about noise a little bit I'm not
2191.71,3.029,going to go again into detail it's one
2193.269,3.33,get of a field there's an abstract class
2194.739,3.901,you derive from and say I have a quantum
2196.599,3.601,error correction code I want to try this
2198.64,4.56,happens to be what's called a steam 7
2200.2,5.19,code and this guy generates a circuit
2203.2,4.349,that says given one logical qubit
2205.39,4.409,replace it with 7 physical qubits and
2207.549,5.46,this encodes the seven into that code
2209.799,5.131,space so I now have a nice encoded value
2213.009,4.56,that I can check for errors as we
2214.93,4.95,compute this is the guy that actually
2217.569,4.53,does the checking so the bottom seven is
2219.88,4.08,the encoding of the logical qubit the
2222.099,3.75,top six are the ones who read everything
2223.96,4.379,on the qubit measure it out and then
2225.849,4.92,decide to apply x and z flips depending
2228.339,4.891,on what went wrong and so this will
2230.769,4.32,actually fix all one qubit errors will
2233.23,4.079,detect all 2 cubed error sounds just
2235.089,4.92,like you do normal coding classically
2237.309,4.8,but this keeps everything quantum this
2240.009,4.74,lets you actually apply this throughout
2242.109,4.71,the system and this is what our friend
2244.749,5.0,teleport looks like once you run it
2246.819,5.04,through this quantum error correction
2249.749,5.11,application it goes through and rewrites
2251.859,4.74,the circuit with and of those syndromes
2254.859,4.26,and then every place you had an ex gate
2256.599,3.99,you now have seven of them or the C
2259.119,3.331,knots or any of those other gates you
2260.589,3.42,saw you now have seven copies that
2262.45,4.919,happen at once and then you check if we
2264.009,5.07,got what you expected so yes your number
2267.369,4.65,of gates blow up very quickly and the
2269.079,4.691,number of qubits blow up very quickly we
2272.019,3.401,also finished a brand new noise
2273.77,5.19,model that's much more physically
2275.42,5.28,accurate what's nice as you can say
2278.96,4.56,specific gates have different noise
2280.7,5.46,models you can say how many qubits are
2283.52,4.92,going to operate on how long in physical
2286.16,4.65,time the gate takes to work a see not a
2288.44,5.43,to cuba cape may take a lot longer than
2290.81,6.66,you know in 20 to 50 nano second stead
2293.87,6.0,of 10 nanoseconds for an X gate and then
2297.47,3.99,you provide a noise model for what you
2299.87,3.57,want to use so now for different types
2301.46,3.93,of qubits different types gates even in
2303.44,4.17,the same system they may be hybrid you
2305.39,4.23,can apply your own noise models the
2307.61,3.48,system gives you back events this noise
2309.62,3.72,event happened at this time on this
2311.09,5.01,qubit on this gate and this is what it
2313.34,4.92,did also your error correction circuitry
2316.1,4.59,is also going to be noisy and that's a
2318.26,4.26,problem it turns out if your gates
2320.69,3.0,aren't good enough about the threshold
2322.52,3.51,the error correction makes it worse
2323.69,4.05,because you've added more gates and the
2326.03,4.32,gates are noisy and everything gets
2327.74,4.59,worse so you actually wind up coming up
2330.35,3.75,with a threshold value of at what point
2332.33,3.39,to your physical gates have to be how
2334.1,4.17,good are you qubits before you can even
2335.72,4.83,fix them and so there's a whole
2338.27,3.69,interesting area Christus evora who
2340.55,3.87,heads the research group that's her
2341.96,4.59,expertise that's her main area is noise
2344.42,5.01,modeling and correction but the one
2346.55,5.67,that's new that again nobody has is we
2349.43,4.83,actually do non unitary noise we do
2352.22,4.2,what's called amplitude damping so if
2354.26,4.44,you read in the papers you know IBM now
2356.42,4.86,has a qubit that lasts one or two
2358.7,7.8,milliseconds sometimes you hear t1 there
2361.28,7.29,t1 time for decoherence that's this you
2366.5,4.65,can we can now model actual decoherence
2368.57,3.84,of the individual qubits as you're going
2371.15,3.06,you can actually put different
2372.41,3.3,probabilities on different qubits so you
2374.21,4.11,have semiconductor cubed you have
2375.71,4.71,quantum dots various other technologies
2378.32,4.44,you can put different decoherence in so
2380.42,4.2,here's a simple circuit again I've got a
2382.76,4.2,how to Marge some super putting a
2384.62,3.51,superposition two cubits and I'm see
2386.96,2.94,nodding together and then a bunch of
2388.13,3.9,idols infinite number of idols what
2389.9,3.99,happens well here's what the damping
2392.03,3.57,probability what happens we start out
2393.89,3.66,with twenty five percent probability for
2395.6,4.17,each of the four possible states because
2397.55,5.13,you could read out the other at 0 0 0 1
2399.77,4.77,1 0 1 1 when I measure it but you'll
2402.68,4.409,notice everything with a 1 and it starts
2404.54,4.499,falling off and the zeros start climbing
2407.089,4.861,and then we get this non unitary event
2409.039,5.73,the thing just d cohered and so two of
2411.95,4.859,them drop the 0 2 of them popped up a
2414.769,5.371,little basically the first qubit went to
2416.809,6.78,0 so the 10 and the 11 state disappeared
2420.14,5.219,and now you can see the 10 keeps keeps
2423.589,3.78,bleeding way to the environment is the
2425.359,4.17,00 keeps going up until he d coheres now
2427.369,5.341,everybody is 00 you've lost your qubits
2429.529,4.351,they're gone so this first time that i
2432.71,3.119,know of anyone's actually built a
2433.88,3.3,simulator that will actually let you do
2435.829,4.2,the physical modeling of what's
2437.18,5.639,happening with the qubits and for sanity
2440.029,5.121,check we took our friend teleport added
2442.819,5.91,quantum error correction on top of it
2445.15,6.159,the steam 7 code put in some
2448.729,5.04,probabilities that were published by
2451.309,4.95,others for actual physical qubits and we
2453.769,5.641,going to fall off at about 3 minus 3
2456.259,4.651,where the whole thing can't keep up the
2459.41,3.209,code can't keep up and there's this
2460.91,3.959,threshold and it turns out that's
2462.619,3.841,exactly what steam predicted the
2464.869,3.45,threshold would be right in that area
2466.46,3.42,for when you have physical qubits and
2468.319,3.871,they look like this this is about where
2469.88,6.209,everything would stop working so about 3
2472.19,7.079,D minus 3 has to be your your t one time
2476.089,4.41,for your qubits if you want to be able
2479.269,2.82,to correct them if you can't keep them
2480.499,3.59,at least in this millisecond range
2482.089,10.92,you're not going to be able to fix them
2484.089,11.861,um yeah kind of honorees of how these
2493.009,5.49,you busy ever again I mean let me let me
2495.95,5.879,let me give you hope the reason
2498.499,5.37,Microsoft is in this at all is we have
2501.829,3.66,an area we're working in and our focuses
2503.869,4.261,is called topological quantum computing
2505.489,4.05,and I can talk to people separately
2508.13,3.3,about it I wasn't going to do it in this
2509.539,4.351,talk about Meyer Ana's and these
2511.43,4.079,quasiparticles we're using but it turns
2513.89,3.179,out instead of having say a single
2515.509,4.141,electron that you're flipping the state
2517.069,4.44,on you actually have a particle that two
2519.65,5.79,of them make up the electron or the
2521.509,7.411,Fermi on actually and they're really one
2525.44,5.25,item but they're separated in space so
2528.92,2.879,these decoherence of X effects if they
2530.69,2.76,hit one of them they don't hurt the
2531.799,4.17,other one you have to hit both at the
2533.45,4.289,same time extremely unlikely the times
2535.969,4.29,for these look like they could be in the
2537.739,3.041,years you don't have the equivalent of
2540.259,2.981,computer
2540.78,4.95,memory where these qubits can last
2543.24,4.89,virtually forever it also means your
2545.73,4.83,error correction now became easy because
2548.13,4.23,they don't go away you can you actually
2550.56,3.87,the gates are done by braiding them
2552.36,3.33,around each other so as long as you
2554.43,3.27,braid them and you don't get them near
2555.69,4.68,each other you can actually do all of
2557.7,4.5,these gates and you have fully fault
2560.37,3.12,tolerant computing now there's lots of
2562.2,3.84,caveats I'm gonna leave all of that out
2563.49,4.59,for now but the point is this is why
2566.04,4.94,Microsoft is so interested we have the
2568.08,5.13,only fields medalist working in industry
2570.98,5.11,Michael Friedman who's down in Santa
2573.21,4.26,Barbara and it's station Q and this is
2576.09,4.73,what we focus that whole effort around
2577.47,5.22,is these topological qubits now in
2580.82,3.46,semiconductor cubicin like you up into
2582.69,4.14,the milliseconds range no reason it
2584.28,4.41,can't go higher and that's enough you
2586.83,4.8,know as soon as we get into the tens of
2588.69,4.59,milliseconds and a little beyond we can
2591.63,4.86,correct them we can keep them alive
2593.28,4.47,forever so we're on that the verge even
2596.49,5.13,for the more traditional or conventional
2597.75,5.94,qubits so it looks pretty good oh it's
2601.62,5.76,all done superconducting let these are
2603.69,6.09,20 millikelvin most of this is run at I
2607.38,3.81,can talk about fridges too i got lots of
2609.78,3.27,pictures on my phone that people want to
2611.19,3.81,see i've been i've been going to all of
2613.05,4.23,our labs and europe is why I'm here and
2615.0,4.02,so we've got some very cool experiments
2617.28,3.09,going on I'm just going to mention the
2619.02,3.21,stabilizers these the ones we can do
2620.37,3.3,tens of thousands of qubits you can take
2622.23,3.42,your normal circuit you compile it into
2623.67,3.69,stabilizers this is teleport again
2625.65,6.48,running and stabilizers I'm not going to
2627.36,6.0,do any detail here but for people who do
2632.13,3.72,this work you can also get statistics
2633.36,4.89,out of where you are in the stabilizers
2635.85,4.08,and what the space looks like but all of
2638.25,3.72,those error Corrections we were looking
2639.93,3.9,at only we're flipping X and Z and turns
2641.97,3.51,out stabilizers know how to do X and Z
2643.83,5.22,and so you can do all your error
2645.48,7.23,correction let me do a machine learning
2649.05,5.49,ok page rank we're going to start with a
2652.71,3.87,standard stochastic probability matrix
2654.54,3.9,the G matrix or Google matrix if you
2656.58,4.5,like but we're going to turn it into a
2658.44,4.47,Hamiltonian I think the identity minus G
2661.08,3.57,adjoint it and identity minus cheat
2662.91,4.08,turns out that gives you a Hamiltonian
2664.65,4.86,that represents those stochastic
2666.99,3.9,probabilities converted to a unitary
2669.51,3.51,this is gets back to our Hamiltonian
2670.89,4.19,simulator we were talking about so now
2673.02,3.99,remember the unitary czar
2675.08,3.67,and we have all their from a starting
2677.01,3.0,state of static probabilities you know
2678.75,4.14,the one over n you would use for
2680.01,5.22,pagerank type thing and then we do an
2682.89,3.9,adiabatic evolution I won't describe the
2685.23,3.12,term unless somebody wants at the moment
2686.79,4.29,but there's a way to do these
2688.35,5.37,hamiltonians and guarantee you can get
2691.08,5.25,to the lowest energy state we accumulate
2693.72,4.5,the average probabilities so here I do a
2696.33,3.63,synthetic web graph using recursive
2698.22,5.1,matrix generation so it's a nice power
2699.96,5.19,law graph 256 pages by the way takes
2703.32,4.26,eight cubits so I can do two billion
2705.15,4.08,pages and 32 cubits and shows you very
2707.58,4.71,quickly we can do big problems on tiny
2709.23,4.83,machines in here you can see regular
2712.29,4.68,page rank and quantum pagerank we get
2714.06,5.49,the same answer this is good I can do
2716.97,5.55,extremely dense encoding and I can pull
2719.55,4.8,pagerank off ah there's a bunch of
2722.52,3.57,caveats you'd never do this in real life
2724.35,3.36,and I can tell you all of them but let's
2726.09,4.02,just say it takes you exponentially long
2727.71,5.46,to actually get this answer out it's
2730.11,4.95,there it works but you wouldn't do it
2733.17,3.33,this way and the problem I have with a
2735.06,4.11,lot of the papers out there everyone
2736.5,4.5,leaves the real costs out and so what
2739.17,4.05,we've been doing a lot is i won't i'll
2741.0,4.23,use the word here debunking a lot of
2743.22,4.5,thee this is exponentially faster no it
2745.23,4.74,isn't you know this is quadratically
2747.72,4.47,faster well only if you ask the question
2749.97,5.52,once and only want one bit of accuracy
2752.19,4.14,out you know that type of thing but
2755.49,2.82,don't worry I'm going to end on a
2756.33,4.47,positive note you know it's not all bad
2758.31,5.07,news this is talking about the
2760.8,5.04,Hamiltonian simulator now one of the
2763.38,3.99,most popular or useful techniques is
2765.84,4.11,called spin glass so what you've got
2767.37,4.32,think of Boltzmann machines think think
2769.95,3.42,of just standard simulated annealing I
2771.69,2.73,have something that can flip up or flip
2773.37,2.76,down I'm going to hook them together
2774.42,3.48,with strengths positive and negative and
2776.13,3.03,I say go and everything flips around and
2777.9,4.67,I'd lower the temperature until
2779.16,6.9,everything stabilizes out okay standard
2782.57,5.92,technique the way we label it here or do
2786.06,5.31,we do it here the first term in the
2788.49,4.47,x-direction basically is think of it as
2791.37,3.6,your temperature if I have that really
2792.96,3.3,strong I turning off all the other links
2794.97,3.3,or I'm overriding by saying push
2796.26,4.02,everybody in one direction I'm going to
2798.27,3.51,make everybody go in the X direction I'm
2800.28,5.13,going to lower the X direction and
2801.78,5.49,increase the H eyes are saying I'm going
2805.41,3.09,to clamp somebody up or down so this
2807.27,2.79,would be like the inputs to your prob
2808.5,5.34,right you'd say these are my input ones
2810.06,5.1,that are a 1 0 1 1 0 and then the ji j's
2813.84,4.59,are connecting them with everybody else
2815.16,5.1,you let this thing cool down and all the
2818.43,3.27,others flip to an interesting state and
2820.26,3.48,some of them you defined as your outputs
2821.7,3.72,and this is normal simulated annealing
2823.74,4.08,miss known as a spin glass problem
2825.42,4.56,there's a company in Canada called
2827.82,3.24,d-wave who ships a quantum computer back
2829.98,2.37,to the question of when we're going to
2831.06,3.84,see quantum computers at least that's
2832.35,3.78,what they say and we can reproduce on
2834.9,3.18,the simulator everything they've
2836.13,4.86,published in nature and science and all
2838.08,5.73,the rest give an example using
2840.99,5.04,ferromagnetic chains we turn this into a
2843.81,5.34,circuit so what you're seeing is the
2846.03,4.68,first column or all the X's then I'm
2849.15,2.94,clamping the left and the right because
2850.71,3.57,the ferromagnetic chain and say they're
2852.09,3.42,up there down there opposite and then
2854.28,3.3,I'm going to link them together those
2855.51,3.81,are the ji J's and finally at the end
2857.58,3.36,I've got the ex's again because we're
2859.32,3.0,doing a higher order approximation back
2860.94,3.66,to the other question on Trotter ization
2862.32,3.75,you can ask for higher order Trotter is
2864.6,4.08,a shins as you break the differential
2866.07,4.56,equation apart be more efficient and we
2868.68,3.84,get all the answers that everybody's
2870.63,3.48,published and we can do noise modeling
2872.52,3.3,and tangle Matt entropy all sorts of
2874.11,3.96,other things on here you're interested
2875.82,4.77,this is going into nature it's being out
2878.07,4.05,for review right now but they let us put
2880.59,3.06,this up there's been so much buzz they
2882.12,3.87,let us put it up on the archive and
2883.65,4.86,there's a link there if anybody wants to
2885.99,7.16,read it there's a big big paper on this
2888.51,6.96,and all the details traveling salesman
2893.15,3.73,here's an example of a Hamiltonian for
2895.47,3.36,traveling salesman what you're doing is
2896.88,4.14,encoding the edges so you're going to
2898.83,7.11,say I want to drop down edges between
2901.02,7.8,cities oh they are I know we've reached
2905.94,4.17,eleven o'clock so it's okay okay I'm
2908.82,4.79,getting to the end here and anyone who
2910.11,5.52,wants to leak out feel free it's okay i
2913.61,3.64,just want to mention the same problem
2915.63,3.21,with doing this classically is we've
2917.25,2.82,just naively put in traveling sales when
2918.84,3.54,you start getting problems where you get
2920.07,3.21,disconnected roots instead of the full
2922.38,3.84,because there is no higher order
2923.28,5.25,constraints we can do eight cities
2926.22,3.18,twenty eight cubits other people publish
2928.53,3.03,papers saying oh a higher order
2929.4,3.87,constraint lets me do more like a four
2931.56,4.92,body instead of a two bodies simulation
2933.27,5.16,yeah I get a doubling in the speed this
2936.48,3.78,solves at butts four times the amount of
2938.43,4.52,work and that's the part that gets left
2940.26,2.69,out of the papers
2943.73,9.22,and egopay poems in terms of what no no
2950.82,4.22,no no no no never said that all I'm
2952.95,4.95,trying to do is reduce the prefactor
2955.04,7.09,okay I never made a claim that you know
2957.9,7.8,P equals NP or b QP is P or any of that
2962.13,4.92,no no no okay I'll finish fast
2965.7,2.7,unfortunate this is probably the best
2967.05,3.81,part of it but we'll just leave it I
2968.4,3.99,took too much time on the other there's
2970.86,2.88,another Hamiltonian model second
2972.39,5.79,quantization this lets you do molecular
2973.74,7.68,chemistry um this is H to two hydrogen's
2978.18,5.43,together this is simulating it the blue
2981.42,3.63,is our simulator compared to publish
2983.61,3.27,results we actually get more more
2985.05,3.93,accurate results we're actually telling
2986.88,4.77,you naturally where the two nuclei will
2988.98,4.41,come together to balance out the energy
2991.65,3.78,you can run the whole thing from script
2993.39,4.53,mode you can run this on a cluster this
2995.43,3.93,is all of water being simulated so this
2997.92,3.51,actually is doing bond lengths and
2999.36,3.78,angles to show you what a water molecule
3001.43,3.24,this is we're back to what Fineman said
3003.14,5.31,you'd use a quantum computer for is
3004.67,4.98,simulating quantum physics again we get
3008.45,3.24,different numbers and the traditional
3009.65,3.69,approaches but you solve it exactly what
3011.69,4.32,we get is exactly the right answer to
3013.34,4.14,the precision we asked for the problem
3016.01,3.27,here this takes thirty four thousand
3017.48,4.02,gates then you got to run a two to the
3019.28,3.72,14th times get 14 bits back to see then
3021.5,3.15,another two to the 10th time to get rid
3023.0,3.27,of the cognitive ed problems and then
3024.65,3.99,about 50 samples per point to make sure
3026.27,4.41,you got the ground state and 546 points
3028.64,5.16,for the plot this is 10 to the 16th gate
3030.68,4.71,ops we can cheat and so we do with the
3033.8,3.57,quantum chemist oh I'm not going to go
3035.39,4.17,into this now everyone interested this
3037.37,3.9,is a linear algebra you can do to get
3039.56,5.43,your two to the 15th by 2 to the 15th
3041.27,5.61,matrix down to 441 by 441 oh and by and
3044.99,4.23,once you've done that your exponential
3046.88,3.81,powers of two just become matrix
3049.22,3.9,multiplies times themselves and that's
3050.69,4.05,how I solve this actually okay I can't
3053.12,4.47,actually run the gates for the length of
3054.74,5.22,time it would take these are all the raw
3057.59,4.26,numbers for if you now add oh I don't
3059.96,3.45,have all the rotations oh I have errors
3061.85,3.87,all high oh this gets very big and in
3063.41,4.56,fact there's an IRP challenge using a
3065.72,4.62,molecule called ferredoxin which takes
3067.97,4.44,about 10 to the 23rd gate operations
3070.34,3.779,that's a century and a half at current
3072.41,5.399,technology speeds back to when will we
3074.119,6.69,have this however we've come up with a
3077.809,4.56,new technique that will let you take the
3080.809,2.79,scaling down from n to the fourth where
3082.369,3.42,n is the number of orbitals of the
3083.599,4.531,molecule down to n squared with no
3085.789,3.631,reduction in error and in fact if you're
3088.13,3.389,interested this isn't out yet but
3089.42,3.929,there's a paper coming that if you
3091.519,3.901,notice at the bottom there's a 5.8
3093.349,4.041,billion gate operations needed for
3095.42,4.619,ferredoxin we've got it down to
3097.39,4.149,thirty-seven thousand which took your
3100.039,3.78,century and a half down to a week and a
3101.539,4.351,half now it's reasonable and that's with
3103.819,4.651,today's cubed technology in terms of
3105.89,5.729,speeds so we've now reached a point
3108.47,6.0,where we can do it you build a machine
3111.619,5.071,that can do this you can do much further
3114.47,4.049,than chemists can do today they can get
3116.69,4.589,to maybe a hundred orbitals if they're
3118.519,7.07,lucky we can get the hundreds above that
3121.279,6.54,and solve very complex molecular
3125.589,3.791,problems I'm going to give you one more
3127.819,3.78,example that I'm also working on right
3129.38,4.139,now with Matthias you can also do
3131.599,4.02,simpler Hamiltonians you effective
3133.519,3.81,models and when you do that this is
3135.619,3.99,called the Hubbard model this scales
3137.329,4.23,linearly with the size of the problem so
3139.609,3.66,I can actually simulate entire sheets of
3141.559,3.24,superconductors and design
3143.269,4.861,high-temperature superconductors this
3144.799,5.07,way so in fact on the right is from a
3148.13,4.01,paper he previously published on the
3149.869,4.531,left is liquid simulation of the
3152.14,3.699,material these r coupe rates which are
3154.4,2.58,high-temperature superconductors and by
3155.839,3.361,the way the numbers aren't the same
3156.98,3.539,because again we went built it did the
3159.2,4.889,simulation and found their numbers were
3160.519,5.79,wrong so in lots of cases here when you
3164.089,4.26,actually implement it give you one
3166.309,3.571,example Shor's algorithm when we
3168.349,3.121,implemented it we found the paper was
3169.88,3.989,completely wrong they left a gate out
3171.47,3.99,that all you get is random answers you
3173.869,3.301,will actually get the real solution and
3175.46,5.22,no one ever knew it because no one ever
3177.17,5.04,simulated it and there's lots of
3180.68,2.909,documentation i can give anyone who
3182.21,2.97,wants this paper we're actually going to
3183.589,3.301,put it up externally which is just an
3185.18,3.899,overview of what this talk talks about
3186.89,4.949,it's also an 80-page user's manual
3189.079,5.311,there's msdn documentation and that's
3191.839,4.47,probably enough for today so i'm here
3194.39,4.619,for two days anybody wants to talk my
3196.309,5.0,schedule right now is wide open and I'm
3199.009,2.3,at your disposal
3205.75,5.92,questions sure in the remark and you
3210.5,5.61,were saying you need to keep track of
3211.67,7.59,the whole space them either no Theory
3216.11,5.49,around you know getting inside from what
3219.26,5.55,you're going to query in the end and get
3221.6,4.26,some variation of bounds profitez your
3224.81,4.08,entangled as soon as you have
3225.86,4.41,entanglement you can't even look at the
3228.89,2.25,state I'm one of the things we didn't
3230.27,3.3,talk about in here at all these
3231.14,4.41,debugging how do you figure out where
3233.57,3.36,you are in all of this even before you
3235.55,5.4,can do it variation else I even have to
3236.93,5.31,understand the system and I can't and I
3240.95,2.67,have there a bunch of techniques we've
3242.24,3.45,started putting quantum debuggers
3243.62,3.57,together but you can't like single step
3245.69,3.09,and ask what are the values of the
3247.19,3.96,variables because it's distributed
3248.78,4.38,across two to the 30th elements what do
3251.15,3.6,you do well it turns out there are ways
3253.16,2.7,you can make believe you measured we can
3254.75,4.29,do things you're not allowed to do
3255.86,5.67,quantumly but that's a whole separate we
3259.04,4.17,can talk about but it's really it's it's
3261.53,3.9,terrible you can't buy that you also
3263.21,4.74,can't clone these are linear types if
3265.43,4.44,you prefer once you've read it you can't
3267.95,4.83,read it again and it's gone from where
3269.87,5.73,you read it so you can't copy anything
3272.78,5.16,you can't look at it without destroying
3275.6,3.87,it on and on and on and on now again
3277.94,3.84,we're simulating which means we can
3279.47,3.78,cheat so things we can do you copied all
3281.78,2.97,the state vector and do stuff to it
3283.25,5.76,that's illegal and then keep the rest of
3284.75,5.64,it going okay but even so the analysis
3289.01,2.67,is such that I said if they weren't
3290.39,2.4,entangled I could bring this thing down
3291.68,4.23,I don't know when things aren't
3292.79,5.31,entangled you have to tell me as a user
3295.91,3.93,I've just separated these the circuit
3298.1,4.11,did the right thing there now
3299.84,4.59,disentangled but you can say check that
3302.21,4.35,I'm right which is extremely expensive
3304.43,3.3,and it goes through and figures it out
3306.56,2.67,and lets you know if it is then it
3307.73,3.39,really disentangled otherwise it says
3309.23,2.94,you have a circuit bug that type of
3311.12,3.9,thing so we do have all of that
3312.17,4.92,implemented but automatically in any
3315.02,6.0,efficiency being able to do that is
3317.09,7.69,virtually impossible frustrating it's
3321.02,6.5,fun but it's frustrating yeah
3324.78,4.06,for the results age talked about at the
3327.52,4.86,end of your talk on molecular
3328.84,6.18,simulations how much of that is done
3332.38,4.95,using your current simulation and how
3335.02,3.63,much of it is waiting for actual quantum
3337.33,3.75,computer all events with the current
3338.65,5.07,simulator all of it now should let me
3341.08,5.79,caveat everything through water water
3343.72,5.61,h2o I can fit in under thirty cubits the
3346.87,3.54,others I can compile the circuits and
3349.33,2.37,get all that all the numbers in those
3350.41,4.71,tables are from the simulator but I
3351.7,4.35,can't run them right but we verified the
3355.12,2.76,techniques we're doing this
3356.05,4.14,multiresolution Trotter ization that we
3357.88,5.79,can actually throw away ninety-eight
3360.19,5.12,percent of the matrix this is again do
3363.67,4.26,it's basically doing a multiresolution
3365.31,3.97,decimation of the matrix so we
3367.93,2.64,precondition the matrix to figure out
3369.28,4.23,what doesn't matter and throw them away
3370.57,4.65,below the accuracy you care about and by
3373.51,3.21,doing that these are a lot of its
3375.22,3.03,standard linear algebra techniques or
3376.72,5.25,HPC techniques that have never been
3378.25,5.31,applied in this field so but in answer
3381.97,4.11,to your question all everything you saw
3383.56,4.29,up there of h 2 h 2 o those have all
3386.08,3.39,been fully simulated and actually water
3387.85,5.15,only takes about a minute for me to do
3389.47,6.42,once i've done all of those classical
3393.0,4.48,tricks on a quantum computer it would
3395.89,7.38,take longer actually because that's do
3397.48,13.16,all the games give the transition from
3403.27,10.35,the gaze to the amazonian a gate is a
3410.64,9.58,summary of a time step of a hamiltonian
3413.62,8.43,so e to the i HT is the unitary so over
3420.22,3.96,a period of time when you run those
3422.05,4.62,gates they go to a steady-state so the X
3424.18,6.18,the Y the Z that the Hadamard see not i
3426.67,6.03,will steady-state solutions to apply in
3430.36,3.9,the hamiltonian that so the Hamiltonian
3432.7,3.42,is the transition to get from one to the
3434.26,3.81,other normally that's fine if i'm doing
3436.12,3.69,digital operations then i'm fine i'm
3438.07,3.54,saying i want to flip this bit well i
3439.81,3.87,have to move it after actually moved the
3441.61,4.32,qubit and flip it and that's the
3443.68,5.28,hamiltonian doing that the unitary is
3445.93,4.14,the effect of that as as simon was
3448.96,2.46,saying that you know the whole point is
3450.07,3.24,why can't I just do that well the
3451.42,3.54,problem is if I'm doing spin glasses and
3453.31,3.12,things they're all flipping and while
3454.96,3.3,they're partially moving they're talking
3456.43,2.07,to each other and so now I actually have
3458.26,2.09,to go
3458.5,4.47,down into the Hamiltonian actually do
3460.35,4.51,traveling salesman or or whatever the
3462.97,3.75,machine learning type problem and
3464.86,5.91,mapping on to it PageRank is like that
3466.72,6.45,for example you are solving trig
3470.77,4.22,equation yeah the Hamiltonian does is
3473.17,9.47,full Schrodinger wave equation basically
3474.99,7.65,yeah April like I said I'm available
