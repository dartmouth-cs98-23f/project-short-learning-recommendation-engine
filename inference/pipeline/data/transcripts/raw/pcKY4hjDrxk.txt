0.03,4.71,hi the topic is dreadful search and
2.73,4.62,depth-first search in this video I will
4.74,6.12,cover these two traversal methods by
7.35,5.1,taking various examples well for such an
10.86,6.179,effort search our graph traversal
12.45,6.81,methods so we'll understand quickly the
17.039,5.16,difference between them throw this a
19.26,4.92,small example then afterward I'll take
22.199,5.731,another example and I will explain you
24.18,5.55,in detail now for quick understanding I
27.93,5.73,have taken a simple graph actually it's
29.73,6.81,a tree but a tree is also a graph so let
33.66,6.21,us see so for traversal both of these
36.54,5.66,traversal we have to know these two
39.87,5.07,terms now for understanding these
42.2,4.69,traversals we should know two terms one
44.94,4.139,is visiting a vertex means going on a
46.89,4.829,particular vertex second Irma's
49.079,5.041,exploration of vertex exploration means
51.719,4.741,if I am on sub particular vertex then
54.12,5.52,visiting all its adjacent vertices is
56.46,5.099,called as exploration so based on these
59.64,4.169,two terms we can understand traversals
61.559,4.981,so first I will explain in breadth first
63.809,4.38,search see I am selecting vertex one as
66.54,3.72,the starting vertex to find out
68.189,5.22,breadth-first search we can select any
70.26,7.56,vertex as a starting vertex now vertex
73.409,6.841,one I will visit the vertex one now once
77.82,5.07,the vertex is visited this word is I
80.25,5.28,will start exploring means I will visit
82.89,6.15,all adjacent vertices so who are those
85.53,5.49,five four and two in which order I can
89.04,4.259,visit I can visit them in any order so
91.02,8.55,okay I will take two first then four
93.299,8.191,then five next I should select the next
99.57,3.869,vertex for exploration so these are
101.49,3.96,already visited vertices after one I
103.439,4.29,have a set at two four five then I
105.45,4.68,should explore explore what I will
107.729,5.28,explode - so who are a listen to two
110.13,4.41,adjacent to two or seven six three in
113.009,3.841,which order you can take you can take
114.54,5.25,them in any order 7 then three then six
116.85,5.58,in any order you can take that's all all
119.79,4.8,the verses are visited and there is no
122.43,6.059,vertex remaining for exploration
124.59,7.0,this is breadth-first search now let us
128.489,7.491,look at depth first
131.59,7.66,I'll start from vertex one then from one
135.98,7.679,I have stowed start its exploration so I
139.25,7.14,will go to vertex two - now who are
143.659,6.931,other adjacent vertices four and five no
146.39,6.599,don't visit them you have reached a new
150.59,5.729,vertex so you start exploring that
152.989,5.521,vertex okay I'll start excluding - then
156.319,4.801,who are adjacent to this seven six and
158.51,5.61,three so I want to go to three okay go
161.12,5.039,to three then shall I use it six and
164.12,5.55,seven also known this is that first
166.159,5.58,search start exploring three so if I
169.67,4.89,start exploring three there is nothing
171.739,6.0,connected to three okay so it means
174.56,5.009,three is a completely explored then come
177.739,7.95,back and then continue the exploration
179.569,8.78,of - so who are there six explore six
185.689,5.7,nothing is there come back go to seven
188.349,5.651,explore seven visit seven explore 7
191.389,5.791,there is nothing so come back to one now
194.0,5.639,and continue the exploration of one who
197.18,5.16,are adjacent to it for visit fool and
199.639,6.481,explore for there is nothing come back
202.34,7.53,then go to five five no in this way all
206.12,7.92,are explored so the Traverse cells are
209.87,6.69,different results are different so in
214.04,5.099,breadth first search we will explore a
216.56,5.22,vertex then we go to the next vertex for
219.139,5.31,exploration but in depth first search
221.78,5.4,once we extracted exploring once you
224.449,6.12,visited a new vertex we will suspend
227.18,5.339,this vertex and start its exploration so
230.569,4.17,from one we got two so we started
232.519,4.61,exploring - then from - we went on three
234.739,4.89,so we'll start exploring three like this
237.129,4.57,so when the first search approach is
239.629,3.69,different and breadth for such a process
241.699,3.481,is different so I'll take one more
243.319,3.63,example and explain you what is the
245.18,3.709,difference between that first search and
246.949,5.28,depth-first search with a simple example
248.889,7.481,one more example let us find
252.229,8.671,breadth-first search actually this is a
256.37,5.16,binary tree tree is also a graph so let
260.9,3.36,us perform
261.53,7.58,for search and see so as per binary tree
264.26,9.72,I will perform level order 1 then 2 3
269.11,7.57,then 4 5 6 7 4 5 6 7
273.98,5.85,this is breadth-first search means
276.68,7.47,breakfast surges just like a level order
279.83,6.68,on a binary tree then what is the
284.15,7.019,depth-first search
286.51,7.0,visit one ok Explorer 1 so he got two so
291.169,5.641,stop exploring one and start exploring
293.51,5.01,two so four stop exploring two and
296.81,5.22,continuing exploration of four there is
298.52,5.37,nothing so go back and come to five now
302.03,4.83,nothing is remaining so go back to one
303.89,5.39,and come on this side then six and then
306.86,5.46,go back and seven so this is like
309.28,7.96,pre-order so that first search is just
312.32,8.76,like level order and depth-first search
317.24,9.9,is just like pre-order traversal of a
321.08,8.399,graph I have taken a bigger graph now we
327.14,6.18,will learn about bid for search and the
329.479,6.421,first search in detail first of all
333.32,4.53,breadth-first search for performing grid
335.9,10.1,first search I will take one data
337.85,11.819,structure that is Q I have taken a cue
346.0,6.1,now I'll explain you initial step then I
349.669,5.491,will explain you repeating step so what
352.1,5.129,is the initial step start exploration
355.16,3.66,from any one of the vertex so which what
357.229,3.481,x I should select as a starting vertex
358.82,3.93,for that for search you can select any
360.71,5.31,what else you like so I will select
362.75,5.91,vertex one so in the answer you show it
366.02,6.69,one in the graph you draw here again
368.66,6.569,then add it to Q this is the first step
372.71,4.44,initial step now we will perform
375.229,4.291,repeating steps so what are those
377.15,4.889,repeating steps take all the vertex from
379.52,6.48,Q and start exploring it
382.039,7.111,so what X 1 who are adjacent to 1 4 & 2
386.0,6.75,so explore them so first I want to visit
389.15,4.83,for okay add it to result and also add
392.75,4.77,it to Q next
393.98,6.66,to go to to okay added to result and
397.52,6.15,also added to queue no one is completely
400.64,5.91,explored there is no urges on vertex
403.67,5.79,remaining for vertex one this is first
406.55,4.77,iteration completed now repeat the
409.46,4.14,procedure what to do next
411.32,5.73,select next vertex for exploration from
413.6,6.12,queue that is for start exploring for so
417.05,5.52,whose at this into four three so I am
419.72,5.55,drawing it like a tree here so three is
422.57,5.01,adjacent so add it to queue any other
425.27,5.34,adjacent for for nothing is adjacent for
427.58,5.81,four so four is completely explored
430.61,7.31,now select next vertex for exploration
433.39,9.34,that is two who are adjacent to two
437.92,6.61,three five seven eight I can visit them
442.73,4.44,in any order if I check three it's
444.53,7.5,already explored so then I will prefer
447.17,7.91,going on five first so five five next I
452.03,7.47,want to go on eight okay eight so eight
455.08,8.65,and eight next I will go on seven so
459.5,6.02,seven and at seven here not two is a
463.73,4.17,completely explored
465.52,5.11,now select next vertex for exploration
467.9,5.1,who is that three is there any at this
470.63,5.28,one over this is for three yes to eight
473.0,8.04,nine and ten so two is already visited
475.91,11.07,so first I will take ten ten ten and
481.04,7.95,then nine nine added to queue completed
486.98,3.99,three is completely explored
488.99,5.4,now select next vertex for exploration
490.97,7.44,five anybody had just sent to five yes
494.39,9.27,eight and seven and six so eight or the
498.41,10.79,D visited seven already visited 6 this
503.66,8.22,is 6 so 6 and 6 5 is completely explored
509.2,6.91,select the next vertex for exploration 8
511.88,5.19,who is adjacent to 8 2 and 7 - actually
516.11,5.04,we came from there
517.07,5.73,7 lloyd dotted line so vertex which is
521.15,5.0,already visited we are drawing a dotted
522.8,4.45,line then next vertex for exploration 7
526.15,3.14,7
527.25,4.83,is already explored so is there anything
529.29,4.5,remaining four seven No ten there is
532.08,4.32,nothing nearer to ten
533.79,4.92,no nothing I just said to ten there is
536.4,4.53,nothing as at the same to nine and there
538.71,3.51,is nothing at the same to 6 so that's
540.93,4.68,all this is
542.22,6.45,breadth-first search completed and the
545.61,11.34,tea that we got here is breadth-first
548.67,12.18,search spanning tree dotted edges that
556.95,7.59,we got here they are called as cross
560.85,5.01,edges they are called as cross edges let
564.54,4.17,us see what are the things that we have
565.86,5.04,learned first thing as you can start
568.71,5.34,breadth first search from any vertex you
570.9,6.27,like first point second thing is when
574.05,5.28,you are exploring any vertex 1 then you
577.17,5.67,can visit the suggestion vertices in any
579.33,6.51,order you like this or the second thing
582.84,5.28,then both are leniency is given freedom
585.84,6.21,is given to select any vertex then what
588.12,6.09,is the rule here rule is when you are
592.05,5.36,selecting a vertex for exploration you
594.21,5.879,must visit all its adjacent vertices
597.41,5.5,then only you should go to next vertex
600.089,5.971,for exploration so it if I am exploring
602.91,5.22,one then I should explicit a for as well
606.06,6.09,as two then only I should sell it for
608.13,7.47,for exploration this is the rule the
612.15,5.25,next thing is last thing is you should
615.6,8.04,select our next vertex for exploration
617.4,8.01,from Q only so Q and exploration should
623.64,3.51,be completely done these are the two
625.41,4.26,important points about that first search
627.15,6.15,you follow this one then you can get
629.67,8.16,many answers I will write few more valid
633.3,8.28,breadth first search is here first one
637.83,5.94,I'll start from vertex one that is
641.58,5.4,explore the adjacent vertices so first
643.77,5.01,I'll explode two then four then I have
646.98,3.99,to start exploring two because I have
648.78,5.13,added to first so who are at this into
650.97,4.13,two so I will take eight then five and
653.91,3.14,seven then
655.1,4.08,these are Addison to to all these are a
657.05,4.47,different - - then I should explore
659.18,5.25,which one for so water just sent two for
661.52,5.43,three solid over then explore eight who
664.43,7.26,is adjacent to eight five and seven both
666.95,9.12,are visited now explore 7 so this is six
671.69,7.59,now explore three so ten and nine so ten
676.07,6.18,and nine this is one also this one is
679.28,6.18,also a valid answer then one more
682.25,6.99,I'll start exploration from five from
685.46,7.8,five who are adjacent to eight seven and
689.24,9.69,six now explore two who are resistant 2
693.26,9.54,to 3 and 1 now explore 8 7 is already
698.93,5.64,visited 7 everything is visited 6 and
702.8,8.79,nothing is there so everything is
704.57,9.72,visited explore 3 so 9 + 10 + 4 so 4 3 9
711.59,4.77,10 and 4 I have visited 9 explore one
714.29,6.18,nothing is remaining nine ten for not
716.36,5.94,all are visited so this is also valid so
720.47,3.69,like this you can start from any vertex
722.3,4.59,and you can visit the adjacent in any
724.16,7.41,order so you can form numerous number of
726.89,6.99,valid breadth-first search next we will
731.57,5.43,see depth-first search now next is
733.88,6.48,depth-first search for this I will take
737.0,11.67,a stack stack as a data structure used
740.36,10.98,here let us start I can start the
748.67,5.4,traversal from any vertex highlight so I
751.34,6.9,want to start from vertex one so one is
754.07,6.72,visited this is the initial step now the
758.24,6.12,repeating step what I have to do every
760.79,6.93,time as this new vertex is visited start
764.36,11.76,exploring it so or adjacent to that four
767.72,10.74,and two so visit four four four now the
776.12,4.92,role in the first searches
778.46,5.55,once you have visited one vertex still
781.04,3.99,one more is remaining leave that we will
784.01,3.75,see it afterwards
785.03,5.28,first you start exploring four
787.76,4.62,so this is the rule so once you have
790.31,4.829,reached a new vertex start exploring
792.38,5.04,that new vortex what about that one
795.139,5.25,suspend it and keep it in the stable we
797.42,5.849,can explore it later now start exploring
800.389,5.671,for so from four I can go on three
803.269,6.12,so they go to three three is visited now
806.06,6.24,what to do suspend for and start
809.389,7.32,exploring three from three I can go on
812.3,7.26,ten so ten suspend trees start exploring
816.709,5.37,ten there is no adjacent vertex of ten
819.56,4.5,so go back to three so how to know I
822.079,4.101,wait I have to go back this stack will
824.06,4.62,give me their value so this three
826.18,6.82,continue exploring three so I can go on
828.68,8.06,nine 9 and again suspend tree and start
833.0,7.829,exploring 9 from nyla cannot go anywhere
836.74,8.05,then go back to 3 and start exploring 3
840.829,8.551,so who is the descent to 3 2 so 2 is
844.79,7.65,visited then from 2 whose adjacent
849.38,8.22,suspended to and start exploring two so
852.44,8.1,from 2 8 is Addison so take 8 now start
857.6,8.28,exploring 8 so from there I can go on 7
860.54,10.5,so suspend 8 so 7 is visited now we have
865.88,7.319,to explore 7 from 7 I can go on 5 so 5
871.04,5.31,is newly visited now we have to start
873.199,6.12,exploring Phi so suspend seven and push
876.35,8.07,it into the stack then from 5 who is
879.319,8.551,adjacent 6 so visit six suspend 5 and
884.42,5.88,continued exploration of 6 there is
887.87,6.99,nothing at the same to 6 so go back to 5
890.3,7.589,from 5 where I can go further so I can
894.86,5.219,visit 2 which is already completed right
897.889,5.101,I can visit 8 which is already completed
900.079,5.041,so there is nothing remaining 4 5 so
902.99,4.74,what happens in this way is we are going
905.12,4.8,deep and deep right so in this way
907.73,4.83,almost all vertices are visited only
909.92,4.5,they are completely explored so 5 is
912.56,5.16,completely explored go back to the
914.42,5.4,previous vertex who is that 7 7 from 7
917.72,5.46,very can go from 7 they can
919.82,5.73,one two which is already visited then go
923.18,5.07,back to eight from eight nothing is
925.55,7.11,remaining so from to where I can go I
928.25,6.48,can go to one right then nothing is
932.66,4.92,remaining so go back before from four I
934.73,6.48,cannot go anywhere from three one I
937.58,7.94,cannot use it anywhere so that's all
941.21,7.95,right so here is the defer search
945.52,7.92,traversal result and this is a DFS
949.16,9.69,spanning tree this is depth full search
953.44,13.24,spanning tree and these are just are
958.85,10.68,called as back edges so for this graph
966.68,5.13,we can make a tree like and perform
969.53,6.18,preorder so this is the pre-order of
971.81,6.69,DISA tree c14 310 then nine then two
975.71,5.49,eight seven five six one four three nine
978.5,7.07,eight two so nine two eight seven five
981.2,8.39,six so this is like pre-order traversal
985.57,6.52,no I will write few more valid
989.59,8.26,depth-first search directly looking into
992.09,8.55,the graph I'll start from vertex 1 1
997.85,8.16,this is the first one from 1 I will go
1000.64,10.41,to tea from - I'll go to 8 from 8 I will
1006.01,8.49,go to 7th from 7 and go to 5 then 6 from
1011.05,5.73,6 I cannot go anywhere come back to 5 2
1014.5,4.17,is already completed 7 also completed so
1016.78,4.5,what was the route I have taken so come
1018.67,4.74,back to 7 7 is completely explore come
1021.28,7.2,back to 8 nothing remaining come back to
1023.41,7.86,2 so from - I'll go 2 3 then 9 nothing
1028.48,6.06,is there come back and go to 10 then go
1031.27,5.34,back to 3 and go to 4 then one is
1034.54,7.11,already explode so return back before
1036.61,9.93,then 3 then 2 then 1 finished so this is
1041.65,5.809,one answer then one more I'll show I'll
1046.54,5.94,start
1047.459,9.43,vortex train first is three then I'll
1052.48,7.14,use it to fool than 1 then 2 then 5 then
1056.889,5.37,6 from 6 and 8 cannot go anywhere come
1059.62,7.23,back to 5 come back to 5 and go to 7
1062.259,7.081,then 8 right from 8 and I'm back on to
1066.85,4.59,what is already over so simply go back
1069.34,5.66,to seven then five then come back to 2
1071.44,6.479,then 2 from there I have already gone to
1075.0,5.169,1 1 is already completed right so come
1077.919,6.021,back to 4 then come back to 3 so from 3
1080.169,7.561,who are remaining 10 and 9 so 10 then 9
1083.94,5.859,this is also valid so you can start from
1087.73,4.319,any vertex you like and you can visit
1089.799,4.34,any neighboring vertex but only thing is
1092.049,4.141,once you have visited a new vertex
1094.139,5.821,suspend the exploration of current
1096.19,5.969,vertex and start exploring new vortex
1099.96,3.73,that's all about the first search and
1102.159,3.421,breadth-first search and the time
1103.69,7.31,complexity of both these methods is
1105.58,5.42,order of n and this number of vertices
