1.92,4.399,good morning glass
3.76,3.68,welcome to our second topic in the
6.319,3.28,subject
7.44,4.8,introduction to human computer
9.599,5.321,interaction or xci
12.24,5.28,which deals particularly in computer
14.92,5.88,graphics as we have discussed before
17.52,6.32,that the field of hci
20.8,5.2,covers a wide range of topics
23.84,5.439,and its development has relied on
26.0,5.519,contributions from many disciplines
29.279,6.081,some of the main disciplines which have
31.519,7.921,contributed to hci is computer science
35.36,7.44,and it's been using xci principles
39.44,5.279,in the development of its technology
42.8,4.56,software design
44.719,5.041,development and maintenance
47.36,5.039,user interface management
49.76,4.16,and user interface development
52.399,4.401,environments
53.92,4.72,its prototyping tools and lastly
56.8,3.68,computer graphics
58.64,4.32,and for this session
60.48,5.04,we will mainly discuss about computer
62.96,2.56,graphics
70.96,5.519,the goal of this lecture is to introduce
73.6,4.879,to you the basic concept or fundamentals
76.479,4.721,of computer graphics
78.479,4.561,that you could use as your foundation in
81.2,3.04,understanding computer graphics in
83.04,3.439,general
84.24,5.12,and be able to use it during its
86.479,2.881,implementation
94.4,6.92,to begin with let us define what is a
97.759,3.561,computer graphics
101.759,5.201,computer graphics is the use of
103.92,6.4,computers to create and manipulate
106.96,6.159,pictures on a display device
110.32,4.079,it comprises of software techniques
113.119,2.721,to create
114.399,2.641,store
115.84,4.319,modify
117.04,5.439,or represent pictures
120.159,5.28,it is also the manipulation and
122.479,6.92,representation of the image or the data
125.439,3.96,in a graphical manner
131.52,5.359,so let us now proceed with the types of
134.56,6.16,computer graphics
136.879,7.281,there are two types of computer graphics
140.72,7.36,one is what we call the raster graphics
144.16,6.799,and the other one is the vector graphics
148.08,5.519,in the raster graphics pixels are used
150.959,5.521,for an image to be drawn
153.599,5.761,it is also known as a bitmap image in
156.48,4.8,which the sequence of image is into
159.36,4.56,smaller pixels
161.28,5.12,basically a bitmap indicates a large
163.92,6.28,number of pixels together
166.4,3.8,while in the vector graphics
171.44,5.84,mathematical formula are used to draw
173.84,6.24,different types of shapes lines objects
177.28,2.8,and so on
182.879,4.64,so these are as you can see
185.2,5.039,the two types of graphics the vector and
187.519,2.72,the raster
193.44,6.24,well the raster graphics are
196.319,6.801,most of the time it's uh file extensions
199.68,7.36,are ai or the adobe illustrator
203.12,7.199,eps or the encapsulated postscript
207.04,7.6,cgm a computer graphics meta file
210.319,8.961,pdf or the portable document format
214.64,7.84,and sbgs scalable vector graphics
219.28,5.84,and cdr of the coreldraw files
222.48,4.72,corridor is one of the main applications
225.12,4.24,in graphic editing
227.2,4.16,on the raster side we have
229.36,4.48,much of the
231.36,5.12,file extensions being generated by the
233.84,5.36,raster type of graphics
236.48,4.399,are the following emp the bitmap image
239.2,3.759,file
240.879,4.481,the tiff or
242.959,6.881,image file format
245.36,5.84,the pcx or picture exchange format
249.84,3.44,gif
251.2,4.64,is very familiar to us graphic
253.28,5.199,interchange format
255.84,4.72,and the png the portable
258.479,5.841,graphics format
260.56,5.76,and the last one is the jpeg or what we
264.32,5.84,interpret as the join
266.32,3.84,photographic experts group
272.56,4.639,sorry thousands now
274.639,4.56,discuss what is the main task of
277.199,5.201,computer graphics
279.199,5.921,or the purpose being served by
282.4,4.56,a computer graphics
285.12,4.639,so open graphics
286.96,3.92,it is responsible for displaying art and
289.759,3.681,image
290.88,4.16,data effectively and meaningfully the
293.44,3.12,consumer
295.04,4.48,another one is
296.56,4.16,also used for processing image data
299.52,3.679,received
300.72,5.759,from the physical world such as photo
303.199,3.28,and video content
309.039,4.081,the importance of computer graphics
313.199,4.401,computer graphics uh
315.199,4.881,contribute a crucial function in the
317.6,4.8,world of computing as they furnish a
320.08,5.2,means to encompass
322.4,5.359,a visual element to diverse categories
325.28,4.8,of computer applications
327.759,4.88,computer users witnessed them in a
330.08,4.32,multitude of applications including
332.639,4.961,desktop programs
334.4,5.84,web applications and mobile applications
337.6,5.52,and there are experience in virtually
340.24,7.2,all domains ranging from business
343.12,4.32,to engineering to gaming
349.12,5.12,let us now proceed with the
351.6,4.56,various uses of a
354.24,4.88,computer graphics
356.16,4.24,some of the applications of computer
359.12,3.44,graphics are
360.4,5.2,computer art
362.56,5.759,using a computer graphics we can create
365.6,4.8,fine and commercial art which include
368.319,3.841,animation packages
370.4,4.48,paint packages
372.16,5.599,these packages provide facilities for
374.88,4.72,designing object shapes and specifying
377.759,3.28,object motion
379.6,5.76,curtain drawing
381.039,5.121,paintings logo design can also be done
385.36,3.36,so
386.16,4.56,if you are an artistic person you could
388.72,3.919,also express your
390.72,2.64,creativity
392.639,3.28,in
393.36,5.839,using computer graphics
395.919,6.241,in doing the computer art
399.199,6.241,other application
402.16,6.08,is the computer-aided drawing
405.44,4.96,designing of buildings automobile
408.24,4.48,aircraft is done with the help of
410.4,4.96,computer aided drawing
412.72,6.24,this helps in providing minor details to
415.36,5.76,the drawing and producing more accurate
418.96,4.0,and sharp drawings with better
421.12,2.96,specifications
422.96,3.84,so
424.08,6.88,the most or the commonly used
426.8,4.16,application including this application
431.199,5.681,is the
433.039,6.081,autocad if you're familiar with
436.88,5.389,that's a computer-aided drawing
439.12,3.149,[Music]
443.039,2.72,other type
444.56,3.199,of the
445.759,4.961,other type or applications of computer
447.759,6.641,graphics
450.72,3.68,is the presentation graphics
455.12,6.079,so for the preparation of reports or
457.28,5.56,summarizing the financial statistical
461.199,4.0,mathematical
462.84,3.56,scientific economic data for research
465.199,4.241,reports
466.4,5.6,managerial reports moreover creation of
469.44,4.479,bar graphs pie charts
472.0,5.36,time chart can be done using the tools
473.919,3.441,present in computer graphics
477.759,4.88,so computer governance can also be used
480.08,4.559,in the field of
482.639,4.56,entertainment
484.639,5.201,computer graphics find a major part of
487.199,4.56,its utility in the movie industry and
489.84,5.52,game industry
491.759,5.601,used for creating motion pictures
495.36,4.959,like disney pixar
497.36,4.88,music video television shows cartoon
500.319,4.56,animation films
502.24,5.04,while in the game industry for focus and
504.879,3.681,impact and interactivity are the key
507.28,3.68,players
508.56,5.52,computer graphics helps in providing
510.96,5.519,such features in the efficient way
514.08,4.879,so as you can see you can also use a
516.479,5.44,computer graphics
518.959,5.44,in creation of the motion pictures as
521.919,3.441,well as indication of
524.399,3.761,games
525.36,2.8,computer games
528.32,5.519,the other application is in the field of
531.36,5.599,education
533.839,7.041,computer generated models are extremely
536.959,6.801,useful for teaching huge number
540.88,6.16,of concepts and fundamentals
543.76,6.0,in an easy to understand and learn more
547.04,5.12,using computer graphics many educational
549.76,4.639,models can be created through which more
552.16,4.96,interest can be generated
554.399,5.521,among the students regarding the service
557.12,5.68,or even also using
559.92,5.12,computer graphics in the
562.8,3.44,provocation of education
565.04,5.6,to the
566.24,4.4,young generation or to the professionals
571.279,5.881,so another usage is in the field of
574.16,3.0,training
577.36,5.039,specialized system for training like
579.92,4.88,simulators can be used for training the
582.399,4.481,candidates in a way that can be crushed
584.8,4.719,in a short span of time
586.88,4.56,with better understanding
589.519,5.921,training modules using computer graphics
591.44,4.0,is simple and very useful
596.959,6.641,so another usage is in the
600.08,5.92,field of visualization
603.6,4.72,today the need of visualized things have
606.0,4.64,increased drastically the need of
608.32,4.16,visualization can be seen in many
610.64,4.319,advanced technologies
612.48,4.32,data visualization helps in finding
614.959,4.0,inside the data
616.8,4.08,to check and study the behavioral
618.959,4.0,processes around us
620.88,4.8,we need appropriate visualization which
622.959,5.761,can be achieved through proper usage of
625.68,3.04,computer progress
628.8,4.64,so another message is in
632.16,3.44,the field of
633.44,4.32,image processing
635.6,4.96,but these kinds of photographs or images
637.76,4.639,require editing in order to be used in
640.56,5.2,different places
642.399,5.921,processing of existing image or images
645.76,4.48,into refined ones forwarder for better
648.32,4.56,interpretation is one of the main
650.24,5.76,applications of computer graphics
652.88,5.44,so the most commonly used apps in image
656.0,5.68,processing is like the
658.32,6.959,adobe photoshop
661.68,5.839,another usage is in the machine drawing
665.279,4.721,so computer graphic is very frequently
667.519,5.201,used for designing
670.0,6.64,modifying and creation of various parts
672.72,5.679,of machine and the whole machine itself
676.64,3.52,the main reason behind using computer
678.399,4.321,graphics for this purpose is the
680.16,4.96,precision and clarity we get from such
682.72,3.44,drawing is ultimate and extremely
685.12,3.68,desired
686.16,5.679,for the same manufacturing of machine
688.8,3.039,using destroying
692.72,3.76,and
693.68,5.12,the other one is the
696.48,4.359,application about computer graphics in
698.8,6.479,terms of graphical user
700.839,7.801,interface so the use of pictures images
705.279,6.0,icons pop-up menus graphical objects
708.64,3.92,helps in creating a user-friendly
711.279,4.321,environment
712.56,5.279,where working is easy and present using
715.6,4.4,computer graphics we can create such an
717.839,3.601,atmosphere where everything can be
720.0,4.16,automated
721.44,5.68,and anyone can get that desired action
724.16,7.32,performed in an easy fashion
727.12,4.36,so as you can see that the
733.279,4.081,mobile applications
735.519,4.32,the gui or the
737.36,4.719,graphical user interface and you could
739.839,4.24,see the
742.079,4.641,application of computer graphics
744.079,4.32,including those menus on our cell phones
746.72,4.88,computers
748.399,3.201,operating systems
752.079,2.961,so that's all the
753.839,2.0,possible
755.04,4.08,or
755.839,6.401,as of this moment the usage or the uses
759.12,4.0,of graphics computer graphics
762.24,2.399,so
763.12,3.44,in the near future
764.639,4.801,we don't know that
766.56,6.04,this piece of usage
769.44,3.16,would be
773.2,2.24,could be
774.16,3.679,used for
775.44,4.48,or it can add another
777.839,5.721,application or another usage for the
779.92,3.64,equipment practice
790.32,4.48,so let us now proceed with the common
792.56,2.959,terminologies
794.8,2.56,in
795.519,4.0,computer graphics
797.36,4.719,one of the common terminologies that you
799.519,4.801,encounter is called
802.079,4.961,the image processing
804.32,6.16,it is a method to convert an image into
807.04,4.4,digital form and perform some operations
810.48,3.68,on it
811.44,6.959,in order to get an enhanced image or to
814.16,6.32,extract some useful information from it
818.399,4.24,the other one is
820.48,5.039,pixel
822.639,5.361,it is a pixel or picture element in
825.519,4.961,short
828.0,3.36,is the smallest item of information and
830.48,3.84,image
831.36,4.0,pixels are arranged in a two-dimensional
834.32,3.68,grid
835.36,6.0,represented using squares
838.0,6.0,each pixel is a sample of an original
841.36,5.279,image where more samples typically
844.0,3.55,provide more accurate representations of
846.639,2.481,the original
847.55,5.25,[Music]
849.12,3.68,the other one is the resolution
853.519,6.88,resolution is the number of horizontal
856.48,6.32,and vertical pixels on a display screen
860.399,4.8,the more pixels the more information is
862.8,4.88,visible without scrolling
865.199,3.161,screen resolutions have a pixel count
867.68,2.08,such as
868.36,3.88,[Music]
869.76,3.439,hundred times one two hundred which
872.24,2.959,means
873.199,4.721,one thousand six hundred horizontal
875.199,5.841,pixels and one thousand two hundred
877.92,6.24,vertical pixels
881.04,6.0,the next is the
884.16,5.76,aspect ratio
887.04,4.64,it describes the width and height of a
889.92,4.8,screen or image
891.68,5.519,an aspect ratio consists of two numbers
894.72,5.2,separated by a color
897.199,5.281,the first number denoting the image is
899.92,5.279,width and the second its height
902.48,4.24,for example an aspect ratio of 1.3
905.199,5.281,degrees to 1
906.72,7.119,means the image will be 1.33 times the
910.48,3.359,size of its height
914.079,5.241,the next one is called
916.32,3.0,rasterization
920.32,5.6,it is the task of taking an image
923.279,3.841,described in a vector graphics format or
925.92,4.56,shapes
927.12,6.48,and converting it into a raster image
930.48,5.68,a series of pixels dots or lines
933.6,5.84,which when displayed together
936.16,5.599,create the image which was presented or
939.44,5.04,represented by sheets
941.759,6.0,rasterizing a layer will convert any
944.48,6.0,type of vector layer into pixels
947.759,4.961,as the vector layer the image is made up
950.48,4.4,of geometric formulas to create the
952.72,4.4,contents of your image
954.88,4.8,this is perfect for graphics that need
957.12,5.519,to have clean edges on the scale up
959.68,2.959,significantly
962.79,4.89,[Music]
964.16,6.88,so the last one is called
967.68,3.36,scan conversion
971.68,5.279,so its configuration is a process of
974.32,5.28,representing graphics objects
976.959,6.081,a collection of pixels the graphics
979.6,6.32,objects are continuous the pixel views
983.04,3.919,are discrete each pixel can have an
985.92,4.479,either
986.959,3.44,on or off state
993.92,6.58,so let us now proceed to the different
996.48,6.56,components of a computer graphics
1000.5,5.019,[Music]
1003.04,5.919,the first component is modeling by
1005.519,6.481,modeling it's defining objects
1008.959,4.961,in terms of primitives coordinates and
1012.0,4.0,characteristic
1013.92,4.479,modeling in the technical use of the
1016.0,4.88,term refers to the translation of
1018.399,4.88,objects or phenomena from the real world
1020.88,5.12,into mathematical equations
1023.279,4.481,computer modeling is the representation
1026.0,4.4,of three-dimensional objects on a
1027.76,5.12,computer using some form of software
1030.4,6.08,designed for the purpose
1032.88,5.76,the next one is story restoring means
1036.48,4.559,saving or restoring scenes
1038.64,4.72,and images in memory and on physical
1041.039,2.321,disk
1044.0,5.36,the next one is manipulating
1046.64,5.76,by manipulating it changing the shape
1049.36,5.92,position and characteristic of objects
1052.4,4.96,it refers to the multiplication made to
1055.28,4.16,images
1057.36,6.08,the next one is
1059.44,7.04,rendering by rendering it means applying
1063.44,6.8,physical base procedures to generate
1066.48,6.8,for photorealistic images from scenes
1070.24,5.28,using lighting and shading rendering or
1073.28,6.56,image synthesis is the process of
1075.52,5.279,generating a photorealistic or
1079.84,4.4,image
1080.799,6.161,from a 2d or 3d model
1084.24,5.28,the last one is viewing
1086.96,5.599,viewing
1089.52,5.12,discuss about displaying images
1092.559,4.011,from various viewpoints on various
1094.64,5.07,devices
1096.57,3.14,[Music]
1101.52,5.2,let us now proceed for the framework for
1103.84,2.88,interacting
1106.84,7.0,graphics when it's a framework uh it
1109.84,5.839,consists of input and output devices
1113.84,2.56,graphic system
1115.679,2.961,an
1116.4,4.96,application program and application
1118.64,4.48,model a computer receives input from
1121.36,5.199,input devices
1123.12,5.76,and outputs image to a display device
1126.559,5.201,the input and out of device are called
1128.88,4.24,hardware component so it is as you could
1131.76,3.84,see from
1133.12,5.52,this conceptual framework
1135.6,6.319,is how the computer graphics
1138.64,4.159,started from input devices
1141.919,2.961,and
1142.799,5.641,achieved its final form through the
1144.88,3.56,output devices
1151.52,5.039,and now that's the end of our discussion
1154.08,3.839,about the fundamentals of computer
1156.559,2.961,graphics
1157.919,3.12,and i hope that you have learned
1159.52,4.8,something
1161.039,4.721,about this topic and you will be able to
1164.32,4.16,remember it
1165.76,4.4,on the implementation of various
1168.48,4.0,projections
1170.16,5.32,on our next topic about computer
1172.48,3.0,graphics
