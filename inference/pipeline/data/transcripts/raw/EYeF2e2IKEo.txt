0.342,2.042,Hello friends! Welcome to Gate Smashers!
2.384,3.497,"In this video, we are going to discuss neural networks."
5.881,4.086,Neural networks is one of the most important topics in artificial intelligence.
9.967,3.67,This is important because most of the research...
13.637,3.629,This is one of the most preferable topics in the research area.
17.266,2.356,"Secondly, there are so many applications"
19.622,2.509,that we use on a daily basis.
22.131,3.492,And the neural network is somehow working under them.
25.623,2.478,"For example, Google Translate and Google Assistant."
28.101,4.064,Neural network plays a vital role in them.
32.165,5.999,"I have written the name of the topic as
'Neural networks --> Artificial neural networks'."
38.164,2.581,Let's start with neural networks.
40.745,1.812,What are neural networks?
42.557,2.374,The word 'neural' is referred to neurons.
44.931,5.049,"And 'network' means, obviously, the neurons are connected to each other."
49.98,1.429,"For example, the internet."
51.409,5.211,"On the internet, all the PCs, mobiles, and all these are interconnected."
56.62,1.802,And what do they actually do?
58.422,2.694,"Sharing of information.
Sharing of data."
61.116,1.919,We are doing the same here.
63.035,2.296,The neurons inside the human brain...
65.331,2.028,We are talking about the human brain.
67.359,4.676,"Inside the human brain, there are gazillions of neurons."
72.035,1.989,There is a very high number of neurons.
74.024,3.882,All those neurons are interconnected with a network.
77.906,7.369,"That connectivity helps them flow information and data and process it,"
85.275,2.842,and in parallel processing.
88.117,5.261,"And obviously, they pass the data in very less time"
93.378,2.564,and generate the output.
95.942,3.311,"In the same human brain that works like this,"
99.253,7.244,learning algorithms play a vital role in the human brain.
106.497,5.212,The human brain can learn from experiences and train data in itself.
111.709,8.291,The capacity of training and learning makes the human brain a very important organ.
120.0,2.516,What we are doing here is that
122.516,4.71,we want to build machines in the artificial neural network.
127.226,9.183,We want to implement the same thing as how the human brain works.
136.409,2.882,We call it an artificial neural network.
139.291,3.968,"Obviously, there will be no biological neurons like our brains."
143.259,3.743,But there will be artificial neurons.
147.002,5.535,Those will be connected through a network as the neurons in our brains are connected.
152.537,3.868,"They will also learn, train the data,"
156.405,4.144,"and obviously, try to generate better output."
160.549,5.078,The basic aim of neural networks in artificial intelligence...
165.627,4.476,"If anybody asks you what a neural network is, and what its basic aim is,"
170.103,5.478,its main aim is to copy the human brain as it is in the machines
175.581,2.515,and make them learn from their experience.
178.096,2.814,We are implementing the same thing here.
180.91,2.169,I want to tell you the next point
183.079,6.179,"that we already have computers, supercomputers, and high-computational devices available"
189.258,1.741,"which can do parallel processing,"
190.999,4.162,then how are they different from neural networks.
195.161,2.588,I want to explain it to you with a simple example.
197.749,3.016,"The computers that are already available to us,"
200.765,3.564,"if we check 8 raised to the power 8 in that,"
204.329,3.759,it will generate the output in very less time.
208.088,5.894,But the human brain will definitely take some extra time to calculate this.
213.982,3.262,The human brain is a little less efficient.
217.244,5.279,"But, from the point of view of computation and calculations,"
222.523,4.231,the computers are performing so well.
226.754,5.492,What are the areas where normal computers will not perform well?
232.246,2.402,I want to explain it to you with a simple example.
234.648,2.194,"Let's say, it's your first day at the office."
236.842,2.962,You met so many people there.
239.804,4.974,You recognized their faces.
244.778,2.691,"When you will again go to the office the next day,"
247.469,6.493,your brain will detect and recognize those faces.
253.962,6.778,So many people may have shaved or trimmed.
260.74,3.22,Their appearance may have been changed a little.
263.96,3.231,But you will recognize them.
267.191,2.866,The human brain learns and trains.
270.057,6.53,"If we want to do the same thing on a normal computer, it will have to do all the scanning."
276.587,7.158,"If there are 100 people, you will have to scan them first."
283.745,3.311,You will have to scan their photos and give them to the computer.
287.056,3.114,"If you check again the next day,"
290.17,3.576,"if you make any changes to the photo,"
293.746,3.349,"like they shaved their beard or grew their mustache,"
297.095,4.177,the normal computer will not recognize.
301.272,7.831,"Even if it does so, its performance and output will not be 100% accurate."
309.103,3.775,Its accuracy will lie somewhere between a maximum of 40-50%.
312.878,1.771,That's an inaccurate system.
314.649,1.971,I am telling the same here.
316.62,5.757,We use algorithms and programs on the input data
322.377,4.103,and find out a meaningful output.
326.48,4.326,A normal computer does this.
330.806,5.535,"But, now we have implemented the neural networks."
336.341,6.088,"Now the neural networks will improve, learn, and train"
342.429,1.773,like the brain does.
344.202,2.905,I want to tell another simple example.
347.107,3.981,"Nowadays, the Avengers movie is trending."
351.088,2.752,There is a character of Iron Man or Tony Stark in that.
353.84,3.204,"If I show you any photo of Tony Stark,"
357.044,2.128,"if I show any of his photos to the human brain,"
359.172,6.227,"in which there is a long beard or mustache, or he is wearing the mask of Iron Man,"
365.399,3.625,"or he is making any facial expressions,"
369.024,3.316,you will recognize him immediately.
372.34,4.126,Why? Because the human brain trains everything.
376.466,4.177,"As soon as he tilted his face,"
380.643,2.593,"our human brain will train,"
383.236,3.538,"learn, and recognize Tony Stark."
386.774,3.931,But if you want to do the same with a normal computer
390.705,2.092,"in which there is no neural network,"
392.797,3.424,it cannot do this properly.
396.221,9.965,Because you will have to feed all the facial expressions that he is making.
406.186,6.219,It generates the output on the basis of what you feed to it.
412.405,5.053,Whatever output it will generate will not be so accurate.
417.458,3.326,It obviously tries to implement classification.
420.784,3.086,But that will not be completely accurate.
423.87,7.042,"As he will make a new expression, the computer will not recognize it."
430.912,4.834,Or it will say that it matches 20-30% with Tony Stark.
435.746,3.268,"But if you implement the same with a neural network,"
439.014,6.066,then it will recognize Tony Stark 95%.
445.08,3.255,"Here, the accuracy is increasing."
448.335,4.74,Learning by itself is the power of neural networks.
453.075,5.576,We talk about learning algorithms in neural networks.
458.651,5.311,These learning algorithms are the power of neural networks.
463.962,3.023,This happens inside our brains.
466.985,3.732,We want to implement the same in the neural network too.
470.717,2.533,You must have seen some ads too.
473.25,1.604,Alia Bhatt did an ad
474.854,4.11,in which there was something written in Chinese on her friends' t-shirt.
478.964,3.241,She asks what it meant.
482.205,5.49,He says something related to samurai philosophy.
487.695,2.784,"But as soon as she checked it on Google Translate,"
490.479,3.552,it generated the output immediately.
494.031,5.056,It means that the data of Google is already trained.
499.087,4.726,It trains even more data and learning algorithms work there.
503.813,6.056,"As you give it some data, it will convert the input into some meaningful data,"
509.869,6.693,then it will use the neural network on it and try to learn and improve.
516.562,4.246,I have created a small example of biological neurons.
520.808,2.5,"In biological neurons, we have dendrites."
523.308,3.256,Dendrites fetch the input.
526.564,1.798,They receive the input.
528.362,4.287,Then we have the cell body which is used for processing.
532.649,3.011,Then there are axoms through which the data is passed.
535.66,2.095,These are the terminal axoms.
537.755,3.179,They will connect to the next dendrites further.
540.934,4.116,We use so many keywords here.
545.05,6.014,We are implementing this biological neuron in the machine with artificial neuron.
551.064,5.456,"Here, x1, x2, and up to xn are the inputs."
556.52,2.38,There are some associated waits.
558.9,3.603,"On the basis of that, we are applying mathematical functions."
562.503,3.761,"Like here, sigma.
I am using submission here."
566.264,2.731,"In submission, if I am using the linear function,"
568.995,2.669,"the linear functions is x1, w1."
571.664,2.511,I may use the sigmoid function.
574.175,3.731,I may also use a different quadratic function.
577.906,5.462,These mathematical functions try to generate some output.
583.368,3.402,Then we compare that output with the threshold values
586.77,4.106,that whether the value is accurate or not.
590.876,3.68,"What we do in the artificial neural network,"
594.556,6.417,its base is the biological neuron.
600.973,7.092,The base of neural networks of artificial intelligence
608.065,5.765,is that how the brain works and we want to implement the same in the machine.
613.83,3.182,"If we check on Google Assistant,"
617.012,4.569,"if you ask Google Assistant ""What's the timing of Avengers?"
621.581,1.96,It will pick the keywords.
623.541,1.971,"Means, timing, avengers."
625.512,6.665,And it will show you which timings are available at the nearest multiplexes.
632.177,1.3,What I mean to say
633.477,2.374,is that here it's learning.
635.851,7.149,It tries to use keywords to generate an accurate output.
643.0,3.801,We have so many different architectures in neural networks.
646.801,3.199,"We have single-layer, multi-layer, recurrent, etc."
650.0,2.459,We will discuss them next.
652.459,5.479,And how our functions work and how we change the waits.
657.938,6.283,"Initially, we may assign any random waits to the inputs."
664.221,3.085,"But how we train these waits,"
667.306,2.384,"how we make them accurate,"
669.69,1.696,we will see that in further videos.
671.386,2.653,This is a basic introduction to neural networks
674.039,3.226,about what neural networks are and how we use them.
677.265,1.029,Thank you!
