My research area is the study of power
and limitations of computing. In short, it is
the study of what computers can do and
more computers cannot do.
I'm Subhas Khot. I'm a theoretical
computer scientist
We would like our computers to do a lot
of things for us and in theoretical terms
these are called designing algorithms to solve
computation problems. For the last
several decades, computer scientists have
identified a very large class of
problems.
These are known as NP complete problems, which they would really like to solve
fast . But now they have more or less
accepted that these problems cannot be
solved fast. The Unique Games Conjecture, it
states that certain very specific
computational problem about coloring
nodes of a network to satisfy certain
compatibility conditions and the
conjecture states that this problem is
very hard to solve and, in fact, very hard
to even find. There is only approximate
solutions and what the main consequence
or the implication of the unique games
conjecture is that, if you believe that
this one specific problem is hard to
solve, it implies that lots and lots of
other problems, which computer scientists
are very interested in, there also hard
to solve. The Unique Games Conjecture it's it's
not yet proven, however the research
surrounding the conjecture, all these
efforts, they have actually led to many
many developments in computer science
and mathematics.
On the other hand, it's also useful that
certain competition problems simply
cannot be solved fast, and one such
example being factoring integers. For
example, if I tell you number 35 and
you're supposed to find its factors, if I
times  7, this cannot be solved fast for when
the numbers grow really large, and it
turns out that the security of almost on
online systems
,let's say banking, it depends on our
belief that nobody knows how to factor
integers fast. So the Unique Games Conjecture
it led to quite surprising discovery in
entirely unexpected area of research. We
know what elections are and often the
result of an election is simply decided
by majority vote, Uf there are
two candidates, then whichever candidate
gets more votes wins.
The Unique Games Conjecture, it led to
the reason that this votingscheme is
stable under noise,
meaning even if the words where 
miscountered or maybe there was little bit
of noise in recording the votes. It
won't really change the the winner of
the election by much. For several years, I
have been trying to make progress on
proving the Unique Games Conjecture ,and
in the last four or five years me along
with my coauthors, we do have a quite
promising approaches that I'm excited
about. I personally have started
believing that we do have
actually an approach to prove it and I'm
I'm excited in following these
approaches and I see where these go.
