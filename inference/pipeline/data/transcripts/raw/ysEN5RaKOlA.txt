0.05,8.04,"If you want to learn web development, where 
do you even start? It's hard to find the right  "
8.09,5.82,"advice without suffering from information overload.
That's why I've created this beginner's roadmap!  "
13.91,5.31,"it lays out all the basics you need to learn 
web development we're going to go through each  "
19.22,4.14,"step so by the end of this guide you'll have an 
understanding of the basics of web development and  "
23.36,9.21,"what skills you need to learn I recommend doing 
steps 1 2 & 3 in order then depending on whether  "
32.57,6.72,"you want to focus on more front-end or back-end 
you can do steps 4A or 4B. I personally think  "
39.29,3.78,"it's a good idea for front-end web developers to 
learn at least a little bit of back-end and vice  "
43.07,3.84,"versa knowing the basics of both will help 
you know if you like front-end or back-end  "
46.91,7.98,"web development better sound good let's dig deeper 
into the roadmap before you get into actual coding  "
54.89,5.19,"you'll need to understand some general concepts 
as you start your journey into web development how  "
60.08,7.62,"websites work the difference between front-end and 
back-end and using a code editor all websites at  "
67.7,4.74,"the most basic are just a bunch of files that are 
stored on a computer called a server this server  "
72.44,5.01,"is connected to the Internet you can then load 
that website through a browser like Chrome Firefox  "
77.45,5.55,"or Safari on your computer or on your phone 
your browser is also called the client in this  "
83.0,6.39,"situation so every time you're on the Internet 
you the client are loading data from the server  "
89.39,4.92,"as well as submitting data back to the server this 
back and forth between the client and the server  "
94.31,7.68,"is the basis of the internet web developer roles 
typically fall into three categories front end  "
101.99,6.9,"back end and full stack the terms front end back 
end and full stack web developer describe what  "
108.89,4.7,"part of the client-server relationship that you're 
working with fernand means that you're dealing  "
113.59,4.29,"mainly with the client-side it's called the front 
end because it's what you can see in the browser  "
117.88,5.49,"conversely the back end is the part of the website 
that you can't really see but it handles a lot of  "
123.37,5.67,"the logic and functionality that is necessary for 
everything to work one way you can think about  "
129.04,4.38,"this is that front-end web development is like 
the front-of-house part of a restaurant it's a  "
133.42,5.31,"section where customers come to see and experience 
the restaurant the interior decor seating and of  "
138.73,5.19,"course eating the food on the other hand back-end 
web development is like the back of house part of  "
143.92,4.98,"the restaurant it's where deliveries and inventory 
are managed and the process to create the food all  "
148.9,4.32,"happens there's a lot of things behind the scenes 
that the customers won't see they will experience  "
153.22,6.3,"and hopefully enjoy the end product a delicious 
meal fun illustrations aside both front-end and  "
159.52,5.97,"back-end web development serve different but very 
important functions when you build a website the  "
165.49,5.49,"most essential tool that you'll use is your code 
editor or IDE integrated development environment  "
170.98,5.1,"this tool allows you to write the markup and code 
that will make up the website there are quite a  "
176.08,6.09,"few good options out there but currently the most 
popular code editor is vs code vs code is a more  "
182.17,6.66,"lightweight version of Visual Studio Microsoft's 
main IDE it's fast free easy to use and you can  "
188.83,5.97,"customize it with themes and extensions other 
code editors are sublime text Adam and vim if  "
194.8,4.32,"you're just getting started though I'd recommend 
checking out vs code which you can download from  "
199.12,5.19,"their website now that we've covered some of the 
broader concepts of what web development is let's  "
204.31,5.67,"get into more of the details starting with the 
front end the front end of a website is made up  "
209.98,8.49,"of three types of files HTML CSS and JavaScript 
these files are what is loaded in the browser on  "
218.47,6.54,"a client-side HTML or hypertext markup language 
is the foundation of all websites it's the main  "
225.01,5.28,"file type that is loaded in your browser when you 
look at a web site the HTML file contains all the  "
230.29,5.91,"content on the page and it uses tags to denote 
different types of content for example you can use  "
236.2,11.69,"tags to create headline titles paragraphs bulleted 
lists images and so on HTML tags by themselves do  "
247.89,4.14,"have some Styles attached but they're pretty basic 
kind of like what you would see in a Word document  "
252.03,7.95,"CSS or cascading style sheets lets you style that 
HTML content so it looks nice and fancy you can  "
259.98,6.12,"add colors custom fonts and lay out the elements 
of your website however you want them to look  "
266.1,7.08,"you can even create animations and shapes with 
CSS there's a lot of depth to CSS and sometimes  "
273.18,5.16,"people tend to gloss over it so they can move 
on to things like JavaScript however it's really  "
278.34,7.14,"important to be able to convert a design into 
a front-end website layout using CSS javascript  "
285.48,4.47,"is a programming language that was designed to 
run in the browser using JavaScript you can make  "
289.95,5.76,"your website respond to different inputs from the 
user or other sources for example you can build a  "
295.71,4.41,"back to top button that when the user clicks it 
they'll scroll back up to the top of the page  "
300.12,7.41,"as we mentioned HTML CSS and JavaScript are the 
basic building blocks of front-end web development  "
307.53,6.42,"in addition to them there are a few other tools 
that you'll want to learn at this point package  "
313.95,5.04,"managers are online collections of software much 
of it open source each piece of software called  "
318.99,5.04,"a package is available for you to install and 
use in your own projects you can think about  "
324.03,4.5,"them like plugins instead of writing everything 
from scratch you can use helpful utilities that  "
328.53,4.74,"other people have written already for instance 
you can simply use a slider plug-in instead of  "
333.27,5.13,"having to code it all yourself which could take 
days to figure out why reinvent the wheel if you  "
338.4,6.75,"don't have to the most popular package manager is 
called NPM or node package manager you can also  "
345.15,4.68,"use another manager called yarn both are good 
options to know and use although it's probably  "
349.83,5.67,"best to start out with NPM in addition to package 
manager is you'll want to become familiar with  "
355.5,5.73,"build tools module bundlers and build tools are 
another essential part of the front-end workflow  "
361.23,6.81,"on a basic level these tools run tasks and process 
files you can use them to compile your sass files  "
368.04,6.39,"to CSS transpile your es6 javascript files down 
the es5 for better browser support run a local  "
374.43,4.68,"web server and many other helpful tasks saving 
you a ton of hassle if you were to try to do all  "
379.11,4.89,"these essential steps by yourself three tools 
that you'll continue to come across a lot are  "
384.0,6.45,"gulp web pack and parcel personally I like using 
gulp for my own front-end workflows where I just  "
390.45,5.85,"want to compile my sass and JavaScript files and 
not do too much else the last tool you'll need  "
396.3,5.82,"to learn about in this stage is version control 
version control also called source control is  "
402.12,3.9,"a system that keeps track of every code change 
that you make in your project files you can even  "
406.02,4.59,"revert to a previous chain if you make a mistake 
it's almost like having infinite save points for  "
410.61,5.97,"your projects and let me tell you it can be a huge 
lifesaver the most popular version control system  "
416.58,5.19,"is an open source system called git using git you 
can store all your files and then change history  "
421.77,5.91,"in collections called repositories you may also 
have heard of github which is an online hosting  "
427.68,7.14,"company owned by Microsoft where you can store 
all your git repositories at this point you've  "
434.82,3.57,"learned the basics of friend development and 
have a choice to either delve into additional  "
438.39,5.13,"friends skills or learn about basic backend web 
development with additional front-end there are  "
443.52,4.05,"some more intermediate skills that you will 
want to learn I recommend that you look at the  "
447.57,7.05,"following SAS responsive design and a JavaScript 
framework SAS is an extension of CSS that makes  "
454.62,6.12,"writing styles more intuitive and modular it's 
a really powerful tool with sass you can split  "
460.74,4.89,"up your styles into multiple files for better 
organization create variables to store colors and  "
465.63,6.12,"fonts and use mix-ins and placeholders to easily 
reuse styles even if you utilize just some of  "
471.75,3.96,"the basic features like nesting you'll be able to 
write your Styles quicker and with less headache  "
477.18,6.12,"responsive design ensures that your sales will 
look good on all devices desktops tablets and  "
483.3,5.43,"mobile phones the core practices of responsive 
design include using flexible sizing for elements  "
488.73,6.57,"as well as utilizing media queries to target 
styles for specific devices and widths for example  "
495.3,5.58,"instead of setting your contents to be a static 
400 pixels wide you can use a media query and set  "
500.88,7.14,"the content to be 50% width on desktop and 100% 
on mobile building a website with responsive CSS  "
508.02,7.2,"is a must these days especially as mobile traffic 
is outpacing desktop traffic in many cases once  "
515.22,4.74,"you have the basics of vanilla JavaScript down you 
may want to learn one of the JavaScript frameworks  "
519.96,4.71,"especially if you want to be a full-stack 
JavaScript developer these frameworks come with  "
524.67,4.05,"pre-built structures and components that allow 
you to build apps quicker than if you started  "
528.72,7.59,"from scratch currently you have three main choices 
react angular and view react which is technically  "
536.31,5.85,"a library was created by Facebook and is the most 
popular framework right now angular was the first  "
542.16,4.68,"big framework and it was created by Google it's 
still very popular even though it's been surpassed  "
546.84,6.3,"by react recently and views a newer framework 
created by Evan you a former angular developer  "
553.14,5.34,"well it is smaller news and react and angular is 
growing quickly and is also considered easy and  "
558.48,6.81,"fun to use you might be wondering now okay well 
which framework is the best the truth is they are  "
565.29,5.58,"all good and web development there's almost never 
a single choice that is 100% the best choice for  "
570.87,5.82,"every person in every situation your choice will 
most likely be determined by your job or it simply  "
576.69,5.94,"by which one you enjoy using the most if your end 
goal is to land a job at a company try researching  "
582.63,5.01,"which framework seems to be the most common in 
potential job listings don't worry too much about  "
587.64,4.41,"which framework to choose it's more important that 
you learn and understand the concepts behind them  "
592.05,5.52,"and once you learn one framework it'll be much 
easier to learn other ones after that let's move  "
597.57,7.38,"on now to our last section backend web development 
the backend or server side of web development is  "
604.95,5.01,"made up of three main components the server 
a server-side programming language and the  "
609.96,4.65,"database as we mentioned at the very beginning 
the server is the computer where all website  "
614.61,5.67,"files the database and other components are stored 
traditional servers run on operating systems such  "
620.28,5.94,"as Linux or Windows they're considered centralized 
because everything the website files back-end code  "
626.22,6.75,"and data are stored all together on the server 
nowadays there are also serverless architectures  "
632.97,5.64,"which is a more decentralized type of setup this 
type of application splits up those components and  "
638.61,4.86,"leverages third-party vendors to handle each 
of them despite the name though you still do  "
643.47,4.59,"need some kind of webserver to at least store 
your website files some examples of service  "
648.06,6.39,"providers are AWS Amazon Web Services or nullify 
Cir furless set ups are popular because they are  "
654.45,4.41,"fast cheap and you don't need to worry about 
server maintenance they're great for simple  "
658.86,5.34,"static websites that don't require a traditional 
server-side language however for very complex  "
664.2,6.33,"applications the traditional server setup might 
be a better option on the server you need to use  "
670.53,4.59,"a programming language to write the functions 
and logic for your application the server then  "
675.12,5.4,"compiles your code and conveys the result back 
to the client popular programming languages for  "
680.52,7.56,"the web include PHP Python Ruby c-sharp and Java 
there is also a form of server-side JavaScript  "
688.08,6.24,"node.js which is a runtime environment that 
can run JavaScript code on the server finally  "
694.32,5.55,"you'll need to learn about databases databases as 
a name implies are where you store information on  "
699.87,6.42,"your server for your website most databases use a 
language called SQL pronounced sequel which stands  "
706.29,5.7,"for structured query language in the database 
data is stored in tables sort of like complex  "
711.99,7.56,"Excel documents then you can write queries in SQL 
in order to create read update and delete data the  "
719.55,4.65,"database is run on the server meeting servers 
like Microsoft sequel server on Windows servers  "
724.2,6.3,"and my sequel for Linux there are also no sequel 
databases which store the data in JSON files as  "
730.5,5.98,"opposed to the traditional tables one type of no 
sequel database is MongoDB which is often used  "
736.48,6.45,"with react angular and view applications some 
examples of how data is utilized on websites  "
742.93,4.62,"are if you have a contact form on your website 
you could build the form so that every time  "
747.55,5.52,"someone submits the form their data is saved on 
to your database you can also store user logins  "
753.07,4.08,"on the database and write logic in the server-side 
language to handle checking and authenticating the  "
757.15,7.56,"logins and that's how I would recommend you start 
your journey into web development I've compiled  "
764.71,3.63,"a list of resources to help you get started 
learning at any of these stages linked below"
