8.23,1.74,"SCOTT AARONSON: Well, I wanted to create my own video games,"
9.97,1.76,"originally, as a kid."
15.23,3.3,"So, my advisor had a saying, ""If you've never a missed a flight"
18.53,3.17,"you're spending too much time in airports."" It applies more"
21.7,1.33,generally as well.
27.57,8.1,"Probably, like poking holes in a – in a tank for some lizards,"
35.67,3.43,"pet lizards that we bought and checking that indeed, if it's"
39.1,2.87,"ten holes this way and seven holes this way, then it"
41.97,3.6,invariably is going to be 70 holes in total.
49.87,2.76,The biggest thing that most people don't realize so much is
52.63,3.24,"the travel, right, the fact that you really get to see the world"
55.87,1.76,just going to different conferences.
61.73,2.64,Having good ideas.
68.47,6.03,"Well, I think they illuminate what can and can't be done in"
74.5,5.23,"computation according to the laws of physics, which if you"
79.73,4.27,"care about that sort of thing and a lot of people seem to,"
84.0,2.3,then hopefully it's of interest to you.
90.87,5.8,"Well, at the sort of level of the historic greats, I would"
96.67,3.96,"say, Alan Turing. At the level of people who I personally got"
100.63,2.54,"to know, I would say Umesh Vazirani, my advisor at"
103.17,3.5,"Berkeley. He had this saying, to concentrate on the high order"
106.67,4.93,"bits, right, just concentrate on the important stuff. Don't"
111.6,3.17,worry about the trivial stuff and he really sort of showed
114.77,1.26,that by example.
119.93,3.7,What would surprise people is just how little in Theoretical
123.63,4.0,Computer Science we actually rely on computers. We use them
127.63,2.87,to check e-mail and do word processing pretty much
130.5,1.4,like anyone else.
136.17,4.53,"Myself, probably. [Aside from yourself] Oh, aside from myself,"
140.7,3.7,"I guess, my computer is probably the most expensive thing there."
148.87,3.8,"No, I don't play music. Nah, if it's – if it's ambience then"
152.67,4.13,I'll enjoy listening to it but I'm happy to just hear the
156.8,1.17,sounds of the street.
