7.32,6.06,so much fast they had students and
10.21,4.92,researchers and the things you teach are
13.38,4.39,pragmatically minded
15.13,4.59,I practically minded freaking figuring
17.77,4.47,out ways how to solve real problems and
19.72,4.559,fast right so from your experience
22.24,8.25,what's the difference between theory and
24.279,8.46,practice of deep learning well most of
30.49,3.779,the research in the deep mining world is
32.739,3.861,a total waste of time
34.269,6.121,all right that I was getting it yeah
36.6,7.51,it's it's a problem in science in
40.39,6.239,general scientists need to be published
44.11,4.53,which means they need to work on things
46.629,4.14,that their peers are extremely familiar
48.64,3.809,with and can recognize in advance in
50.769,5.46,that area so that means that they all
52.449,5.551,need to work on the same thing and so it
56.229,3.75,really Inc and and the thing they work
58.0,4.68,on there's nothing to encourage them to
59.979,5.581,work on things that are practically
62.68,5.52,useful so you get just a whole lot of
65.56,4.11,research which is minor advances and
68.2,5.6,stuff that's been very highly studied
69.67,5.97,and has no significant practical impact
73.8,3.73,whereas the things that really make a
75.64,3.45,difference like I mentioned transfer
77.53,4.95,learning like if we can do better at
79.09,5.07,transfer learning then it's this like
82.48,5.52,world-changing thing we're suddenly like
84.16,7.1,lots more people can do world-class work
88.0,5.88,with less resources and less data and
91.26,5.14,but almost nobody works on that or
93.88,4.98,another example active learning which is
96.4,4.92,the study of like how do we get more out
98.86,4.32,of the human beings in the loop where's
101.32,3.75,my favorite homage yeah so active
103.18,4.14,learning is great but it's almost nobody
105.07,4.409,working on it because it's just not a
107.32,5.13,trendy thing right now you know what
109.479,5.641,somebody's suicide interrupt you're
112.45,5.04,saying that nobody is publishing an
115.12,4.41,active learning but there's people
117.49,5.669,inside companies anybody who actually
119.53,5.519,has to solve a problem they're going to
123.159,3.781,innovate an active learning yeah
125.049,3.27,everybody kind of reinvents active
126.94,3.03,learning when they actually have to work
128.319,3.81,in practice because they start labeling
129.97,3.27,things and they think gosh this is
132.129,3.44,taking a long time and it's very
133.24,4.77,expensive and then they start thinking
135.569,2.711,well why am i labeling everything I'm
138.01,2.19,own
138.28,3.72,the machines only making mistakes on
140.2,3.03,those two classes they're the hard ones
142.0,2.75,maybe you ought to start labeling those
143.23,3.72,two classes and then you start thinking
144.75,3.52,well why did I do that manually why
146.95,2.54,can't I just get the system to tell me
148.27,5.16,which things are going to be hardest
149.49,6.73,it's an obvious thing to do but yeah
153.43,5.19,it's it's just like like transplant
156.22,4.29,learning it's it's under studied and the
158.62,4.38,academic world just has no reason to
160.51,3.66,care about practical results the funny
163.0,3.09,thing is like I've only really ever
164.17,4.649,written one paper I hate writing papers
166.09,4.02,and I didn't even write it it was my
168.819,3.931,colleague sebastian ruder who actually
170.11,4.47,wrote it I just did the research for it
172.75,3.93,but it was basically introducing
174.58,5.04,transfer learning successful transfer
176.68,8.309,learning to NLP for the first time the
179.62,6.99,algorithm is called GLM fit and it
184.989,3.931,actually I actually wrote it for the
186.61,4.11,course for the first day of course I
188.92,2.97,wanted to teach people in LP and I
190.72,2.79,thought I only want to teach people
191.89,3.54,practical stuff and I think the only
193.51,4.14,practical stuff is transfer learning and
195.43,4.589,I couldn't find any examples of transfer
197.65,4.589,learning and NLP so I just did it and I
200.019,4.53,was shocked to find that as soon as I
202.239,4.711,did it was you know the basic prototype
204.549,3.841,took a couple of days smashed the
206.95,3.18,state-of-the-art on one of the most
208.39,4.11,important data sets in a field that I
210.13,4.35,knew nothing about and I just thought
212.5,6.72,well this is ridiculous
214.48,7.86,and so I spoke to the best unit and he
219.22,5.16,kindly offered to write it up the
222.34,5.01,results and so it ended up being
224.38,4.65,published in a CL which is the top link
227.35,4.41,with computational linguistics
229.03,5.76,conference so like people do actually
231.76,5.19,care once you do it but I guess it's
234.79,5.1,difficult for maybe like junior
236.95,5.28,researchers or like like I don't care
239.89,3.629,whether I get citations or papers
242.23,2.729,whatever I was right there's nothing in
243.519,3.241,my life that makes that important which
244.959,3.9,is why I've never actually bothered to
246.76,4.91,write a pic of myself now for people who
248.859,7.741,do I guess they have to pick the kind of
251.67,6.369,safe option which is like yeah make a
256.6,4.55,slight improvement on something that
258.039,3.111,everybody is already working on
266.75,2.06,you
