0.12,3.2,assembly a low-level programming
1.8,3.24,language allowing humans to give
3.32,3.519,instructions to the computer's Hardware
5.04,3.84,you see computers can only do things in
6.839,3.601,terms of zero or one so assembly was
8.88,3.04,created in order to make computer
10.44,3.6,instructions more workable for human
11.92,3.719,beings this works by using an assembler
14.04,3.319,that translates the human readable code
15.639,3.521,into one's and zeros assembly is one of
17.359,3.0,the world's first programming languages
19.16,2.72,it used to be the standard to run
20.359,3.08,supercomputers back in the day but you
21.88,3.52,still find it used currently to work
23.439,4.721,with CPU memory and it's used sometimes
25.4,4.6,in browsers via web assembly Fortran one
28.16,3.32,of the world's first highle languages
30.0,3.079,the difference between a highle language
31.48,3.16,and a lowlevel language is in a
33.079,3.64,low-level language you can manipulate
34.64,3.84,the computer's memory much more directly
36.719,3.68,it also executes much faster than a
38.48,3.68,highle language the drawback is is that
40.399,3.401,it's much harder to learn a highle
42.16,2.96,language is much easier to understand
43.8,3.439,and there's a lot of support but the
45.12,4.759,code is much slower Fortran was created
47.239,4.401,by IBM in the 1950s the name stands for
49.879,3.48,a formula translator programming in
51.64,3.12,Fortran would be done by using a punch
53.359,3.161,card then would be fed into a card
54.76,3.36,reader and would be translated into code
56.52,3.559,that the computer can understand this
58.12,3.399,translating process is called compiling
60.079,3.361,which basically changes the code that
61.519,4.0,humans can read into the ones and zeros
63.44,3.92,computers can understand comtran also
65.519,3.441,known as commercial translator is
67.36,3.399,another programming language developed
68.96,3.799,by IBM it served as the business
70.759,3.841,equivalent to Fortran in which Fortran
72.759,3.201,was used for scientific Computing it was
74.6,3.12,influenced by another programming
75.96,3.64,language called flomatic a programming
77.72,3.24,language for data processing that ran on
79.6,3.879,this giant supercomputer called the
80.96,4.199,univac 1 lisp also known as list
83.479,3.441,processing was created soon after
85.159,3.361,Fortran it's known for using a lot of
86.92,3.32,parentheses in its code it was an
88.52,3.52,Innovative language which in insired
90.24,3.559,these Concepts in programming cobal
92.04,3.2,standing for common business oriented
93.799,3.96,language was the programming language
95.24,4.28,developed in 1959 for you guessed it
97.759,3.68,businesses even though it was made so
99.52,3.599,long ago it is still used today by many
101.439,3.441,financial institutions to process
103.119,3.521,transactions the code looks like plain
104.88,3.519,English sentences but this would later
106.64,3.36,be translated onto a punch card one of
108.399,4.68,the first adopters of the language was
110.0,4.68,the US Department of Defense IBM RPG IBM
113.079,3.481,report program generator is a
114.68,4.0,programming language created by IBM
116.56,3.72,meant to run on IBM systems it's one of
118.68,4.0,the only programming languages to makes
120.28,4.68,use of rows and columns for its code
122.68,4.16,alol 60 short for algorithmic language
124.96,3.439,1960 is not a very well-known
126.84,3.199,programming language but is one of the
128.399,3.161,languages that inspired one of the most
130.039,3.521,well-known programming languages in the
131.56,3.72,world C it was also one of the first
133.56,4.679,programming languages to use nested
135.28,5.08,functions APL standing for a programming
138.239,3.601,language first appeared in the 1960s is
140.36,3.56,a programming language developed for
141.84,3.92,mathematical equations mostly algebra it
143.92,3.72,uses a lot of math and Greek symbols
145.76,3.6,directly in the code simula a
147.64,3.52,programming language made many decades
149.36,4.0,ago that was one of the world's first
151.16,4.0,object-oriented language objectoriented
153.36,3.8,programming is a way for programmers to
155.16,3.6,use blocks of code that are reusable and
157.16,2.92,can interact with each other instead of
158.76,2.72,pure functions and logic in
160.08,3.6,object-oriented programming you use
161.48,4.08,blocks of code called objects objects
163.68,3.6,are created by things called classes
165.56,3.64,which contain properties and can use
167.28,4.12,methods to explain it simply you can
169.2,4.2,create a class called Pok√©mon name the
171.4,3.88,object Charmander give it properties
173.4,3.759,such as fire type and allow it to
175.28,3.72,execute methods such as flamethrower and
177.159,3.16,scratch Speak Easy A programming
179.0,3.12,language that was mainly M used by
180.319,4.56,physicists in the' 60s it's known for
182.12,4.399,using a colore in its code basic the
184.879,3.121,beginners allpurpose symbolic
186.519,3.881,instruction code was created at
188.0,3.92,Dartmouth in 1963 it was created with
190.4,3.199,the purpose of getting the average lay
191.92,3.599,person to be able to learn how to code
193.599,3.801,you see before that time programming had
195.519,3.64,only been the domain of scientists and
197.4,4.04,mathematicians this was because of its
199.159,3.841,easy to understand syntax syntax is
201.44,4.159,basically the rules to writing in a
203.0,4.48,programming language Ms Ms aka the
205.599,3.601,Massachusetts General Hospital utility
207.48,3.759,multiprogramming system or sometimes
209.2,4.039,just m for short was created to manage
211.239,3.801,Hospital laboratory Information Systems
213.239,3.64,it was also used to manage electronic
215.04,3.68,health records its code tends to be very
216.879,3.64,tur which means you can take most of its
218.72,4.28,word commands and abbreviate them into
220.519,4.241,simple short letters logo an educational
223.0,3.12,programming language made in the' 60s
224.76,3.52,which makes use of what is known as a
226.12,4.0,turtle graphic not an actual Turtle it's
228.28,3.599,the name of the cursor used to draw
230.12,3.8,geometric shapes as determined by the
231.879,4.2,code Pascal a programming language that
233.92,3.8,was very popular in the' 70s even being
236.079,3.08,the default language for many computers
237.72,2.879,back in the day it was one of the first
239.159,3.36,programming language to be used by an
240.599,3.601,IDE which is an integrated development
242.519,3.28,environment basically a dedicated
244.2,3.28,program to write its code one of the
245.799,4.0,most well-known programs created with
247.48,4.2,Pascal was Photoshop C A programming
249.799,3.241,language created in the' 70s that is one
251.68,3.279,of the most popular programming
253.04,3.96,languages of all time created at Bell
254.959,4.041,Labs it is the basis of many operating
257.0,3.759,systems such as Windows and Linux it
259.0,4.639,also inspired many programming languages
260.759,6.841,that came after it such as C++ c
263.639,5.28,objectiv c go Java JavaScript PHP Python
267.6,2.92,and many more it's known for its
268.919,3.921,lowlevel ACC access to the computer's
270.52,4.08,memory by using code called pointers
272.84,3.32,computer memory was much more of a
274.6,3.2,finite resource than the past so
276.16,3.24,programmers had to be much more careful
277.8,3.2,about how they allocated it otherwise
279.4,3.32,it'll cause problems such as memory
281.0,3.52,leaks which is basically when programs
282.72,3.8,use up too much memory in your computer
284.52,4.0,causing the computer to become painfully
286.52,3.679,slow Small Talk a programming language
288.52,3.6,in the' 70s that was known for its
290.199,3.401,object-oriented programming it inspired
292.12,3.12,many object-oriented programming
293.6,3.319,languages that came after it prologue
295.24,3.399,known as the first logic programming
296.919,4.28,language it is known for being modeled
298.639,4.481,after formal logic in philosophy ml also
301.199,3.801,known as meta language pioneered
303.12,3.76,statically typed functional programming
305.0,4.28,which basically means giving information
306.88,4.36,certain types such as strings integers
309.28,3.639,Floats or booleans strings are just
311.24,3.88,words and letters integers are whole
312.919,3.961,numbers floats are real numbers so they
315.12,4.799,can be decimals and Boolean is something
316.88,5.36,that can be either true or false SQL SQL
319.919,4.361,also known as structured query language
322.24,4.0,also even called SQL is a language used
324.28,3.479,for creating and managing databases you
326.24,3.32,store information in things called
327.759,3.401,tables and structure them with rows and
329.56,3.479,columns the code also looks like plain
331.16,3.56,English sentences it is used by many
333.039,3.241,systems even today to store their data
334.72,3.4,such as usernames and passwords
336.28,3.6,transactions account information and
338.12,4.519,more basically think of it as a system
339.88,4.68,of Excel spreadsheets C++ an extension
342.639,4.081,of the C programming language the major
344.56,4.32,difference is C++ has object-oriented
346.72,3.68,programming unlike the original C which
348.88,3.52,didn't it's also known for its steep
350.4,3.56,learning curve C++ is one of the most
352.4,3.88,important programming languages of all
353.96,4.04,time even still in wide use today still
356.28,4.12,being the main programming language in
358.0,4.8,creating operating systems web browsers
360.4,4.16,databases and games Ada a programming
362.8,3.44,language made in the 1980s that is
364.56,3.4,mainly used by the US Department of
366.24,4.6,Defense it is named after the credited
367.96,4.959,world's first programmer Ada l mat Lab
370.84,3.799,Mat lab or Matrix library is a
372.919,3.601,mathematics programming language used by
374.639,3.481,data scientists and Engineers it's a
376.52,3.84,mathematics based programming language
378.12,4.0,that can be used for statistics Robotics
380.36,3.839,and artificial intelligence it's still
382.12,3.88,widely used today mainly by Academia
384.199,3.56,Objective C A programming language
386.0,3.919,inspired by C that was created in the
387.759,3.801,1980s which became the main language for
389.919,3.441,Apple Computers even being the main
391.56,3.88,language for the early iPhones although
393.36,3.88,its popularity has fallen over the years
395.44,3.599,mainly due to Apple replacing it by a
397.24,4.04,newer programming language called Swift
399.039,4.241,in the mid-2020s lab view made by
401.28,3.4,national instruments in the 1980s it is
403.28,3.359,a programming language that doesn't
404.68,3.56,really use traditional code instead it's
406.639,3.321,a graphical programming language where
408.24,3.92,you build user interfaces and handle
409.96,3.6,code using images llang a programming
412.16,2.96,language designed for the Telecom
413.56,3.28,industry Pearl a language that was
415.12,3.479,designed to work very well with text
416.84,3.68,it's used for system administration
418.599,3.521,Network programming finance and more
420.52,3.0,Pearl has been known as the duct tape
422.12,2.84,that holds the internet together if
423.52,3.399,you've ever seen the code it actually
424.96,3.6,looks pretty wacky Wolfram created by
426.919,3.4,Steven Wolfram it's a language that can
428.56,3.6,perform data visualization image
430.319,3.16,processing mathematics and pretty much
432.16,2.479,anything you can think of it can even
433.479,2.72,tell you the shortest route around
434.639,3.161,Europe hcll it's a functional
436.199,3.521,programming language with its unique
437.8,3.28,feature of its variables being immutable
439.72,3.28,which means you can't change them the
441.08,3.72,language is based on Lambda calculus
443.0,3.52,Visual Basic a programming language
444.8,3.679,developed by Microsoft in the early '90s
446.52,4.2,it's used to create Microsoft programs
448.479,4.28,and applications by using guis or
450.72,3.479,graphical user interfaces basically
452.759,2.801,anything you can interact with with your
454.199,3.28,mouse on the screen is part of the
455.56,4.359,graphical user interface it also has a
457.479,4.16,very popular IDE of the same name Lua a
459.919,3.641,language known for its speed and being
461.639,3.4,able to be embedded into other programs
463.56,3.599,it's also known for being very easy to
465.039,3.56,learn Deli nothing much to say about it
467.159,3.281,it's basically Pascal but with
468.599,4.121,objectoriented programming it even comes
470.44,3.879,with its own code editor oaml oaml is a
472.72,3.36,functional based programming language
474.319,3.32,like haskel and earling functional
476.08,3.239,programming languages are good at doing
477.639,2.801,math and objectoriented programming
479.319,3.241,languages are good for building
480.44,3.52,Enterprise level software python python
482.56,2.88,is a general purpose programming
483.96,3.12,language and you can use it to make
485.44,3.96,pretty much anything from desktop
487.08,4.839,applications to websites creating bots
489.4,4.32,or API handling servers and databases
491.919,3.481,game development image processing
493.72,3.08,statistics and so much more that it
495.4,2.72,would need its own video python is
496.8,3.239,currently one of the most popular
498.12,3.199,programming languages for creating AI
500.039,3.44,it's also one of the most popular
501.319,3.56,programming languages in general in fact
503.479,2.801,most beginner programmers start with
504.879,3.481,python as their first programming
506.28,4.0,language not only for its vast utility
508.36,3.679,but also how easy it is to learn one of
510.28,3.52,its only drawbacks is that it tends to
512.039,4.56,be pretty slow compared to other
513.8,4.599,programming languages like C++ Ruby Ruby
516.599,3.56,is a language very similar to python
518.399,3.12,even the code looks similar Ruby is easy
520.159,3.24,to learn and the code is also very
521.519,3.521,readable one of the most popular uses of
523.399,3.841,Ruby is to combine it with a framework
525.04,4.239,called on Rails to create websites
527.24,3.719,adopting the full name Ruby on Rails
529.279,3.281,Ruby on Rails is currently the backbones
530.959,5.841,to many websites we know currently such
532.56,6.0,as Hulu Airbnb coinbase Shopify twitch
536.8,3.159,SoundCloud and many more a lot of its
538.56,3.44,popularity was was its ability to be
539.959,3.361,able to create full stack websites full
542.0,2.92,stack is the combination of the
543.32,3.28,front-end and the backend development of
544.92,2.88,a website a website's front-end is
546.6,3.52,basically everything you can see with
547.8,4.159,your eyes basically the entire interface
550.12,3.44,the text the images the buttons and the
551.959,3.201,videos are all part of the front end the
553.56,3.2,back end is the non-visual part of the
555.16,3.239,website which is mainly the servers and
556.76,3.36,databases account information
558.399,3.281,authentication and data storage is
560.12,3.24,what's part of the back end Java
561.68,3.2,remember the thing some programs ask you
563.36,3.32,to install on your computer yeah that's
564.88,3.28,an actual programming language it gained
566.68,3.32,popularity immediately after it's
568.16,3.4,released and it's still popular today a
570.0,2.92,big advantage that Java has is that it
571.56,3.12,allows you to create programs that are
572.92,3.599,very platform independent that's because
574.68,3.399,Java can be compiled into B code which
576.519,3.121,can be understood by many operating
578.079,3.401,systems all your computer would need is
579.64,3.04,a Java runtime environment to do this
581.48,2.72,which is what you're installing every
582.68,3.399,time your computer asks you to install
584.2,3.28,Java Java can be used to create many
586.079,3.161,things like video games such as
587.48,3.52,Minecraft or mobile apps on Android a
589.24,3.96,meme amongst beginner programmers is
591.0,4.079,that Java's code tends to be prey verbos
593.2,4.16,R A programming language in which its
595.079,3.801,main purpose is statistics it's a widely
597.36,2.96,popular programming language used to
598.88,3.28,organ organized data and data
600.32,3.84,visualization it's very useful for
602.16,4.04,researchers conducting epidemiological
604.16,4.4,studies if you're a researcher studying
606.2,4.879,in fields such as economics psychology
608.56,4.56,biology medicine Etc learning how to
611.079,4.681,code in either python or R is a very
613.12,4.44,useful skill JavaScript JavaScript is
615.76,3.8,not the same as Java in fact it has
617.56,3.88,nothing to do with Java JavaScript is a
619.56,4.56,programming language that is mainly only
621.44,4.8,used in web browsers in fact 98% of the
624.12,3.92,internet uses JavaScript JavaScript is
626.24,3.36,responsible for the main functional
628.04,3.56,aspect of the website it's it's based on
629.6,4.679,the ecmascript standard and is often Us
631.6,4.0,in conjunction with HTML and CSS but
634.279,3.201,sometimes you can create websites which
635.6,3.679,is pure JavaScript using Frameworks such
637.48,5.0,as react and with react mobile you can
639.279,5.0,create mobile apps HTML and CSS HTML and

653.8,3.32,used for the design or aesthetic look of
655.92,3.479,the website it deals with the
657.12,4.56,arrangement of content colors borders
659.399,6.321,gradients opacities and can even perform
661.68,5.8,animations PHP PHP AKA personal homepage
665.72,3.559,but sometimes also called hypertext
667.48,3.56,pre-processor is a programming language
669.279,4.441,mainly used on web servers you can
671.04,4.88,actually embed PHP directly into HTML
673.72,3.679,PHP although waning in popularity is
675.92,3.159,still the backbone of many major
677.399,3.401,websites today it was the language Mark
679.079,3.521,zuger bird first built Facebook in
680.8,3.76,action script a language based on
682.6,3.72,JavaScript in which its main purpose was
684.56,3.36,its use in Flash have you ever played a
686.32,3.88,flash game back in the day that was most
687.92,4.159,likely made using AC script it was first
690.2,4.199,created by macromedia which released
692.079,4.44,action script 1 and version 2.0 but when
694.399,4.44,macromedia was later bought out by Adobe
696.519,4.32,Adobe released action script 3.0 even
698.839,3.8,though as of 2020 Adobe Flash has died
700.839,4.161,out you can still use action script with
702.639,4.401,Adobe animate C A programming language
705.0,5.12,made in the early 2000s by Microsoft it
707.04,4.64,was influenced by C++ and Java C's most
710.12,3.48,common uses are being used in web
711.68,3.68,servers with the Net Framework and video
713.6,3.919,game development with the unity engine
715.36,4.32,Scala Scala was made as an alternative
717.519,3.641,to Java it also uses many of Java's same
719.68,3.32,technology such as the Java virtual
721.16,3.32,machine but unlike Java it has many
723.0,3.36,features of functional programming
724.48,3.44,Powershell basically the Windows command
726.36,4.039,line on steroids come with its own
727.92,4.28,scripting language FSH f is the sister
730.399,3.161,language to C with the difference of it
732.2,3.28,being able to support functional
733.56,3.68,programming Julia a programming language
735.48,3.56,made in the early 2010s in order to
737.24,3.32,perform high level computations data
739.04,3.4,analysis and visualization and
740.56,3.56,Mathematics its main advantage is that
742.44,3.399,it's much faster than other programming
744.12,3.24,languages that do this the code is a lot
745.839,3.401,easier to read and it's much easier to
747.36,3.76,learn oh a programming language designed
749.24,3.56,to create graphical user interfaces for
751.12,3.56,websites it can be compiled into
752.8,3.56,JavaScript Nim a programming language
754.68,4.12,with the Simplicity of python combined
756.36,4.279,with the memory allocation of C++ Raku
758.8,4.64,nothing much to say it's basically Pearl
760.639,5.281,but version six although it has a pretty
763.44,4.639,wacky logo scratch a programming
765.92,4.24,language made in MIT that is completely
768.079,4.44,Visual and block based no seriously the
770.16,3.72,code fits together like Lego blocks it
772.519,2.841,was made with the purpose for teaching
773.88,3.079,children how to code despite its
775.36,3.52,Simplicity you can make pretty complex
776.959,3.601,things with It Go formerly known as go
778.88,3.399,Lang was created at Google to be a
780.56,3.519,modern version of C the code can be
782.279,3.56,similar to python but it's much faster
784.079,3.281,due to its compiling method it's mainly
785.839,3.8,used in servers with Frameworks like
787.36,4.919,Docker holy C A programming language
789.639,4.32,created by Terry a Davis in 2005 made
792.279,3.841,with assembly it was used to create an
793.959,3.801,operating system called Temple OS an
796.12,3.6,operating system inspired by a
797.76,3.48,revelation from God the main interest in
799.72,3.2,this programming language is due to the
801.24,3.24,backstory of the developer although
802.92,3.159,being a talented programmer suffered
804.48,3.479,from and ultimately succumbed from his
806.079,3.961,battle with schizophrenia cotlin known
807.959,4.361,as the easier form of java is a language
810.04,4.64,used to create mobile apps on Android OS
812.32,4.319,the most popular IDE to code cotlin in
814.68,4.48,is Android Studio typescript basically
816.639,4.241,JavaScript but with static typing Dart a
819.16,2.919,programming language created by Google
820.88,2.88,that you can use to create web
822.079,3.76,applications or mobile apps using the
823.76,4.04,flutter framework Swift developed by
825.839,3.481,Apple to replace Objective C it is the
827.8,3.36,standard programming language to create
829.32,3.72,anything in iOS and it comes with its
831.16,3.52,own code editor called xcode you can
833.04,3.88,only code in Swift if you have an Apple
834.68,4.079,computer or use a virtual machine rust
836.92,3.76,okay this is the true modern version of
838.759,3.721,CN C++ it's good if you want to write
840.68,3.68,simple code while also handling memory
842.48,3.2,issues it's a very popular programming
844.36,2.76,language and it's used to make
845.68,3.279,applications where performance is
847.12,3.92,extremely important such as game engines
848.959,3.521,or operating systems solidity a
851.04,3.28,programming language created for the
852.48,3.88,ethereum network programs created in
854.32,3.519,solidity are called smart contracts
856.36,3.08,these Smart Tracks are later deployed to
857.839,3.201,the blockchain however once smart
859.44,3.68,contracts are deployed to the blockchain
861.04,4.12,they cannot be changed or altered again
863.12,3.44,so before a contract is deployed usually
865.16,3.119,developers test them thoroughly
866.56,3.399,beforehand this is done using testing
868.279,3.321,environments such as truffle and hard
869.959,3.481,hat depending on the smart contract can
871.6,3.599,cost memory and even money in the form
873.44,4.319,of ethereum to work its main uses are
875.199,4.521,for creating web 3.0 decentralized apps
877.759,4.88,decentralized Finance applications or
879.72,4.239,defi to even your own tokens or nfts the
882.639,3.041,type of smart contract you'll make will
883.959,4.401,depend on the ERC format you're adhering
885.68,4.64,to ERC standing for ethereum request for
888.36,3.599,comment Elixir a popular programming
890.32,3.879,language that was created in Brazil it
891.959,3.761,runs on the llang beam virtual machine
894.199,3.121,which compiles the language into bite
895.72,2.72,code you can do with Elixir the same
897.32,2.36,things you can do with llang the
898.44,3.959,language which is commonly used for
899.68,4.48,Telecom e-commerce and finance Zig
902.399,3.761,another programming language intended to
904.16,4.08,be the successor of C it was created in
906.16,4.56,the mid 20110 and is slowly gaining in
908.24,4.76,popularity Microsoft power FS a language
910.72,4.44,created in 2021 by Microsoft it is used
913.0,3.72,in a low code program called power apps
915.16,3.2,a low code program is a program that
916.72,3.6,allows you to create applications with
918.36,3.88,little to no code but if you want to add
920.32,3.639,extra logic or functionality to your app
922.24,3.399,it would be done using power effects
923.959,3.401,also the language is based on Microsoft
