8.22,5.4,hey everyone welcome to Simply learn
10.559,5.341,today's video will compare and contrast
13.62,4.98,artificial intelligence deep learning
15.9,4.5,machine learning and data science but
18.6,3.78,before we get started consider
20.4,4.619,subscribing to simplylearn's YouTube
22.38,4.739,channel and hit the Bell icon that way
25.019,5.1,you'll be the first to get notified when
27.119,6.001,we post similar content before moving on
30.119,5.521,let me ask you two interesting queries
33.12,5.16,which among the following is not a
35.64,5.52,branch of artificial intelligence data
38.28,6.0,analysis machine learning deep learning
41.16,5.16,neural networks and the second query is
44.28,4.02,what is the main difference between
46.32,4.079,machine learning and deep learning
48.3,4.439,please leave your answer in the comments
50.399,3.241,section below and stay tuned to get the
52.739,3.96,answer
53.64,4.98,first we will unwrap deep learning deep
56.699,4.621,learning was first introduced in the
58.62,4.919,1940s deep learning did not develop
61.32,5.28,suddenly it developed slowly and
63.539,4.681,steadily over seven decades many Theses
66.6,5.28,and discoveries were made on deep
68.22,5.64,learning from the 1940s to 2000 thanks
71.88,4.32,to companies like Facebook and Google
73.86,4.56,the term deep learning has gained
76.2,5.099,popularity and may give the perception
78.42,4.98,that it is a relatively New Concept deep
81.299,3.541,learning can be considered as a type of
83.4,4.56,machine learning and artificial
84.84,4.98,intelligence or AI that imitates how
87.96,4.799,humans gain certain types of knowledge
89.82,5.28,deep learning includes statistics and
92.759,4.741,predictive modeling deep learning makes
95.1,4.559,processes quicker and simpler which is
97.5,4.619,advantageous to data scientists to
99.659,5.161,gather analyze and interpret massive
102.119,4.801,amounts of data having the fundamentals
104.82,5.1,discussed let's move into the different
106.92,5.1,types of deep learning neural networks
109.92,4.92,are the main component of deep learning
112.02,5.22,but neural networks comprise three main
114.84,4.04,types which contain artificial neural
117.24,5.22,networks or an
118.88,6.64,convolution neural networks or CNN and
122.46,5.28,recurrent neural networks or RNN
125.52,4.159,artificial neural networks are inspired
127.74,4.38,biologically by the animal brain
129.679,4.661,convolutional neural networks surpass
132.12,4.92,other neural networks when given inputs
134.34,5.119,such as images Voice or audio it
137.04,4.86,analyzes images by processing data
139.459,5.201,recurrent neural networks uses
141.9,4.86,sequential data or series of data
144.66,4.14,convolutional neural networks and
146.76,4.199,recurrent neural networks are used in
148.8,4.38,natural language processes speech
150.959,5.341,recognition image recognition and many
153.18,4.919,more machine learning the evolution of
156.3,4.019,ml started with the mathematical
158.099,4.201,modeling of neural networks that served
160.319,5.401,as the basis for the invention of
162.3,5.82,machine learning in 1943 neuroscientist
165.72,4.86,Warren McCulloch and logician Walter
168.12,5.399,Pitts attempted to quantitatively map
170.58,5.519,out how humans make decisions and carry
173.519,5.401,out thinking processes therefore the
176.099,4.86,term machine learning is not new machine
178.92,4.44,learning is a branch of artificial
180.959,4.92,intelligence and computer science that
183.36,4.86,uses data and algorithms to imitate how
185.879,4.921,humans learn gradually increasing the
188.22,4.4,system's accuracy there are three types
190.8,4.5,of machine learning which include
192.62,5.08,supervised learning what is supervised
195.3,5.219,learning well here machines are trained
197.7,5.399,using label data machines predict output
200.519,5.041,based on this data now coming to
203.099,5.101,unsupervised learning models are not
205.56,4.319,supervised using a training data set it
208.2,3.42,is comparable to the learning process
209.879,3.901,that occurs in the human brain while
211.62,3.539,learning something new and the third
213.78,4.08,type of machine learning is
215.159,5.101,reinforcement learning here the agent
217.86,4.68,learns from feedback it learns to behave
220.26,4.559,in a given environment based on actions
222.54,5.04,and the result of the action this
224.819,5.821,feature can be observed in robotics
227.58,4.62,now coming to the evolution of AI the
230.64,4.14,potential of artificial intelligence
232.2,4.619,wasn't explored until the 1950s although
234.78,4.86,the idea has been known for centuries
236.819,5.761,the term artificial intelligence has
239.64,5.819,been around for a decade still it wasn't
242.58,4.62,until British polymath Alan Turing posed
245.459,4.081,the question of why machines couldn't
247.2,4.44,use knowledge like humans do to solve
249.54,4.86,problems and make decisions
251.64,5.04,we can Define artificial intelligence as
254.4,5.16,a technique of turning a computer-based
256.68,5.279,robot to work and act like humans
259.56,4.139,now let's have a glance at the types of
261.959,4.74,artificial intelligence
263.699,5.641,weak AI performs only specific tasks
266.699,5.161,like Apple Siri Google assistant and
269.34,5.04,Amazon's Alexa you might have used all
271.86,4.32,of these Technologies but the types I am
274.38,4.8,mentioning after this are under
276.18,4.62,experiment General AI can also be
279.18,3.78,addressed as artificial general
280.8,4.98,intelligence it is equivalent to human
282.96,5.22,intelligence hence an AGI system is
285.78,3.359,capable of carrying out any task that a
288.18,4.2,human can
289.139,4.981,strong AI aspires to build machines that
292.38,2.64,are indistinguishable from the human
294.12,3.6,mind
295.02,5.22,both General and strong AI are
297.72,4.919,hypothetical right now rigorous research
300.24,4.38,is going on on this matter there are
302.639,4.141,many branches of artificial intelligence
304.62,4.5,which include machine learning deep
306.78,5.9,learning natural language processing
309.12,6.359,robotics expert systems fuzzy logic
312.68,4.239,therefore the correct answer for which
315.479,5.16,is not a branch of artificial
316.919,5.581,intelligence is option a data analysis
320.639,3.12,now that we have covered deep learning
322.5,4.08,machine learning and artificial
323.759,3.72,intelligence the final topic is data
326.58,2.88,science
327.479,4.141,Concepts like deep learning machine
329.46,4.92,learning and artificial intelligence can
331.62,4.74,be considered a subset of data science
334.38,4.44,let us cover the evolution of data
336.36,4.74,science the phrase data science was
338.82,4.26,coined in the early 1960s to
341.1,4.379,characterize a new profession that would
343.08,4.38,enable the comprehension and Analysis of
345.479,3.361,the massive volumes of data being
347.46,3.9,gathered at the time
348.84,4.799,since its Beginnings data science has
351.36,4.14,expanded to incorporate ideas and
353.639,3.961,methods from other fields including
355.5,4.44,artificial intelligence machine learning
357.6,4.74,deep learning and so forth data science
359.94,5.099,can be defined as the domain of study
362.34,4.68,that handles vast volumes of data using
365.039,4.261,modern tools and techniques to find
367.02,4.76,unseen patterns derive meaningful
369.3,5.88,information and make business decisions
371.78,5.74,therefore data science comprises machine
375.18,4.739,learning artificial intelligence and
377.52,4.26,deep learning I hope this was helpful
