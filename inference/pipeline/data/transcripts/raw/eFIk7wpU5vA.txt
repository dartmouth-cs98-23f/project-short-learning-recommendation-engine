0.16,3.6,so a quantum computer is a system that
2.32,3.2,uses quantum properties like
3.76,3.039,superposition and entanglement to
5.52,2.88,perform computations
6.799,3.281,but the quantum computers are being
8.4,2.88,built are doing different things and are
10.08,2.8,using different hardware
11.28,3.519,so in this video let's clear up some
12.88,3.68,terminology on universal gate-based
14.799,3.041,quantum computers and quantum annealers
16.56,2.879,talk about the different hardware
17.84,2.8,implementations and the algorithms that
19.439,2.961,these computers can run
20.64,3.36,and cap it all off with an analysis of
22.4,3.92,what makes a good quantum computer
24.0,3.199,using the divincenzo criteria and ibm's
26.32,2.64,quantum volume
27.199,3.361,and this is also you don't get fooled by
28.96,3.279,silly pop science articles that talk
30.56,3.44,about the sky is falling because we've
32.239,3.84,gotten a certain number of qubits
34.0,3.44,because remember cubic counts don't
36.079,3.681,matter well okay
37.44,4.639,so they do matter some but a handful of
39.76,4.4,amazing qubits is way better than a
42.079,3.521,million cubits that just don't work so
44.16,3.44,just like gpus can process
45.6,4.4,graphics information way faster than
47.6,3.52,cpus certain problems can be solved
50.0,3.28,polynomially
51.12,4.24,or exponentially faster using quantum
53.28,4.0,algorithms by exploiting these effects
55.36,3.76,of superposition and entanglement but
57.28,2.48,what is a quantum annealer and what can
59.12,1.84,it do
59.76,3.119,while they rely on the same quantum
60.96,2.399,mechanical concepts annealers are really
62.879,2.32,good for
63.359,3.521,optimization problems where you can
65.199,4.001,quickly search over a space
66.88,3.76,and find an optimal solution for that
69.2,3.12,you can think of this as looking over a
70.64,2.479,landscape and finding out where the low
72.32,2.88,point is
73.119,3.68,an annealer does that quantum annealers
75.2,3.599,are built for translating quantum
76.799,3.121,unconstrained binary optimization or
78.799,3.041,cubo problems
79.92,3.92,analyzing problems onto quantum hardware
81.84,3.2,efficiently the problems this can solve
83.84,3.279,are traveling salesman
85.04,3.92,scheduling problems optimal placement
87.119,2.96,problems graph coloring problems and
88.96,2.799,even solving games
90.079,3.601,the d-wave machine is probably the most
91.759,3.841,famous example of a quantum annealer
93.68,3.439,it's built using superconducting qubits
95.6,2.24,which is a design based on having a
97.119,2.481,cooper pair
97.84,3.12,which is a pair of electrons or some
99.6,3.36,other fermion with
100.96,3.519,a josephson junction this is actually
102.96,3.519,the same type of qubit that's used for
104.479,4.161,many universal gate quantum computers
106.479,4.561,so they also have this super cool gold
108.64,4.08,steampunk chandelier looking thing which
111.04,3.92,by the way is called a dilution fridge
112.72,3.92,or a creostat this dilution fridge takes
114.96,3.6,the superconducting chip and actually
116.64,2.96,cools it down to temperatures below 15
118.56,2.879,millikelvin
119.6,3.6,then this big box is actually shielding
121.439,3.441,from electromagnetic interference
123.2,3.279,achieved using a radio frequency
124.88,2.239,shielded enclosure and a magnetic
126.479,2.161,shielding
127.119,3.441,since qubits are controlled by this
128.64,4.0,frequency and are very delicate we don't
130.56,2.399,want any outside forces interfering with
132.64,2.16,them
132.959,3.92,for example crosstalk when we try and
134.8,3.28,affect one qubit but accidentally end up
136.879,3.281,affecting another as well
138.08,3.84,so that sounds pretty standard so far
140.16,3.76,right it's the same hardware as these
141.92,3.679,universal gate-based quantum machines so
143.92,3.44,what makes this a quantum annealer
145.599,3.921,the layout of the quantum computer is
147.36,3.92,absolutely the key for putting this cubo
149.52,3.6,and icing objective functions into a
151.28,4.08,format that d-wave can understand
153.12,3.92,and doing so really efficiently binary
155.36,2.32,objective functions can be looked at as
157.04,2.4,graphs
157.68,3.52,and these graphs can be translated onto
159.44,3.36,the quantum hardware so you can take
161.2,3.28,this optimization problem and you
162.8,2.799,construct the hamiltonian equation we
164.48,2.8,need to minimize
165.599,3.041,you can represent it with this graph
167.28,2.72,where the nodes are a and b
168.64,3.04,with the weights corresponding to the
170.0,3.599,equation and the edge between them
171.68,3.839,a b with the weight 7. if this is a
173.599,3.601,traveling salesman problem the 5 and 7
175.519,2.64,can correspond to the time they spend in
177.2,2.8,each location
178.159,4.0,and edge between is the distance between
180.0,4.0,the city d-wave has a couple chip
182.159,4.16,designs the chimera and the pegasus
184.0,4.0,and the pegasus is the latest one this
186.319,3.28,pegasus and chimera structure is
188.0,3.28,optimized to take the graph problem and
189.599,3.441,translate it onto the quantum chip
191.28,3.12,so the chimera hardware basically takes
193.04,2.88,these superconducting qubits and
194.4,2.88,arranges them in a way that you have a
195.92,2.48,unit cell of qubits
197.28,2.72,so the nodes that we have in the
198.4,3.28,equation are mapped to qubits and the
200.0,3.2,edges are mapped to couplers
201.68,3.36,so since we're looking at it like a
203.2,3.36,landscape physics says that everything
205.04,3.6,wants to be in the lowest energy state
206.56,4.0,configuration or the ground state
208.64,4.08,the minimization of that function is the
210.56,3.92,lowest energy state of the whole system
212.72,3.92,so we apply a magnetic field to these
214.48,3.92,qubits changing the superposition and
216.64,2.879,controlling the probability of it being
218.4,2.72,zero or one
219.519,3.761,you can do the same thing with a coupler
221.12,4.399,and that correlates these two qubits
223.28,4.48,so what is the actual annealing part
225.519,3.36,well in thermal annealing we use heat to
227.76,3.52,raise the temperature of
228.879,4.241,say some material when it slowly cools
231.28,2.48,it wants to go back to the lowest energy
233.12,2.479,state
233.76,3.44,for quantum annealing instead of heat
235.599,3.121,it's quantum fluctuations
237.2,3.679,we set up the quantum problem in a
238.72,4.0,hamiltonian and it slowly evolves
240.879,3.601,just like a heated up metal slowly
242.72,3.76,cooling down evolves into its lowest
244.48,4.0,energy state but you may be wondering if
246.48,3.52,it's more limited in the algorithms but
248.48,3.119,is using the same hardware
250.0,3.28,why would we even want to build this
251.599,3.601,annealer the answer is is that the
253.28,3.919,annealer is that much more efficient at
255.2,3.599,solving these optimization problems than
257.199,3.121,a quantum gate based computer is
258.799,3.441,so yes this quantum computer that's
260.32,4.08,universal gate based could do annealing
262.24,4.0,hence universal but it'd be a lot less
264.4,3.359,efficient the opposite is true as well
266.24,3.04,quantum annealers could do other
267.759,3.041,algorithms but it's going to be way less
269.28,2.0,efficient than a gate-based quantum
270.8,2.399,computer
271.28,3.6,so what is universal gate-based quantum
273.199,3.44,computing these quantum systems have a
274.88,3.36,way broader application this system
276.639,4.081,relies on building really reliable
278.24,4.32,qubits we apply basic circuit operations
280.72,2.8,or gates and put them together in any
282.56,3.04,sequence to run
283.52,3.84,more and more complex algorithms quantum
285.6,3.2,computers however have their own set of
287.36,2.48,gates that are very different from
288.8,2.959,classical gates
289.84,3.6,in classical computers we use gates like
291.759,4.241,and not or
293.44,3.68,nand xor and fanout to perform any
296.0,3.12,computation
297.12,3.519,however these gates are irreversible
299.12,2.16,because we lose information in the
300.639,2.56,process
301.28,3.6,for example when we do an or gate we
303.199,3.761,don't know if the first bit was one or
304.88,2.96,the second bit was one or maybe both of
306.96,3.04,them were one
307.84,3.84,so we lose information in that process
310.0,2.88,and the fanout classical gate requires
311.68,2.72,the copying of a bit
312.88,3.44,and we can't do that with quantum states
314.4,2.72,due to the no cloning theorem so what
316.32,2.48,can we do
317.12,3.04,well there's a set of quantum gates
318.8,3.839,unary one qubit
320.16,3.12,binary two qubit and ternary three cubic
322.639,2.161,gates
323.28,3.44,and all these gates are reversible
324.8,3.76,because irreversible gates will destroy
326.72,3.039,the entanglement and superposition and
328.56,3.12,we don't want to do that
329.759,3.521,not until we want to measure the system
331.68,4.799,so these one cubic gates like
333.28,5.28,x y z hadamard and rotation gates change
336.479,4.081,the state of one qubit the hadamard gate
338.56,4.24,puts the qubit in an equal superposition
340.56,4.24,of zero and one two cubic gates like the
342.8,4.0,c naught can entangle two qubits
344.8,3.2,the c naught gate bit flips the state of
346.8,3.119,the target qubit
348.0,3.759,if and only if the control qubit is in
349.919,2.161,the one state there's also a controlled
351.759,1.921,z
352.08,3.36,gate which does a similar thing to c
353.68,3.76,naught but applies a z gate instead of
355.44,3.759,the x bit flip gate and there's also a
357.44,2.479,swap gate to swap the states of two
359.199,2.321,qubits
359.919,3.361,there are also three cubic gates called
361.52,3.92,the fredkin and to foley gates
363.28,3.44,the fretkin gate is a c swap gate so
365.44,3.12,it's a controlled swap
366.72,3.52,which means it will only do that swap if
368.56,3.199,the control qubit is in the one state
370.24,3.6,and the to foley gate is a c
371.759,3.921,c naught gate which means it only does
373.84,3.44,the bit flip if both of the control
375.68,3.2,qubits are in the one state
377.28,2.96,universal gate quantum computers are
378.88,2.8,also coming in a lot of different
380.24,2.88,hardware implementations
381.68,3.68,some are made out of superconducting
383.12,3.359,qubits like the ibm the google and the
385.36,2.959,bleximo machines
386.479,3.28,and others are made out of trapped ions
388.319,2.16,like the ion q and the honeywell
389.759,2.72,machines
390.479,4.321,however other companies like psyquanum
392.479,4.321,are focusing on silicon photonic qubits
394.8,3.76,so will we be able to solve a problem on
396.8,2.88,a quantum computer that can't be solved
398.56,2.96,on a classical machine
399.68,3.359,well we can actually simulate a quantum
401.52,3.84,computer on a classical machine
403.039,4.0,however once we get to 30 or 40 qubits
405.36,2.959,it becomes really hard to do so because
407.039,3.201,it takes so many bits
408.319,3.761,but because a classical computer could
410.24,2.48,in theory simulate a quantum computer of
412.08,2.239,any size
412.72,3.199,assuming they have enough bits that
414.319,2.961,means no we can't solve something like
415.919,1.921,the halting problem with a quantum
417.28,2.24,computer
417.84,3.52,what quantum computers can do is solve a
419.52,4.079,certain set of problems faster
421.36,3.76,but it can't solve everything faster so
423.599,3.761,then a big question
425.12,4.24,is a quantum annealer actually a quantum
427.36,3.839,computer so the official definition of a
429.36,3.6,quantum computer is quantum computers
431.199,4.081,use phenomena like entanglement and
432.96,4.16,superposition to perform computations
435.28,3.52,so yes by this definition quantum
437.12,3.199,annealers are quantum computers
438.8,3.2,they are more limited in the scope of
440.319,3.201,computations that they can do but they
442.0,2.24,still exploit superposition and
443.52,2.079,entanglement
444.24,3.2,but just because it's limited in the
445.599,3.681,scope of algorithms that it can run
447.44,3.68,does not make it not a quantum computer
449.28,3.919,so i say that when you say quantum
451.12,3.04,computer it can refer to both gate based
453.199,2.72,and annealers
454.16,3.599,however you can't efficiently implement
455.919,3.441,shor's algorithm on those annealers
457.759,3.28,so that means if you want to do that you
459.36,3.44,have to have a lot more qubits not even
461.039,3.201,counting all the error correction ones
462.8,2.799,and that's where a lot of the confusion
464.24,2.959,can come in understanding the
465.599,3.28,differences between gate-based quantum
467.199,3.361,computers and quantum annealers gives
468.879,3.521,you context on how the same types of
470.56,2.479,qubits can give very different final
472.4,2.32,results
473.039,3.28,two thousand qubits on a universal
474.72,3.599,gate-based quantum machine is likely
476.319,3.841,more powerful than a quantum annealer
478.319,3.761,with a lot of other factors being equal
480.16,2.879,of course however once you start looking
482.08,2.959,into these factors
483.039,3.921,things can change really drastically the
485.039,3.681,number of qubits isn't everything it's
486.96,3.44,just one factor for power
488.72,3.28,but it's definitely not the only one
490.4,2.88,cubic counts mean nothing if they're
492.0,2.879,really poorly constructed
493.28,2.88,it's also not super helpful to you if
494.879,1.841,you have a quantum annealer with more
496.16,1.84,qubits
496.72,2.96,but the algorithm that you want to
498.0,3.44,implement on it is not very efficient
499.68,3.28,but maybe you have two universal
501.44,3.36,gate-based quantum computers but they
502.96,3.519,have very different error rates
504.8,3.679,that means you're likely to get way
506.479,3.84,noisy calculations or maybe you can't
508.479,3.44,even complete the calculation at all due
510.319,2.16,to the amount of coherence time the chip
511.919,2.56,has
512.479,3.68,or maybe the topology so the way the
514.479,3.601,cubes are connected to one another
516.159,3.281,is so convoluted that you can't really
518.08,1.92,make efficient circuits on it and
519.44,2.159,there's also
520.0,3.279,one other thing you should consider when
521.599,2.721,comparing these cubic counts and the
523.279,3.12,algorithm counts
524.32,3.92,many algorithms show in theory how many
526.399,3.681,qubits are needed for that calculation
528.24,3.599,however in physical implementations of
530.08,3.52,these quantum computers these qubits
531.839,2.801,need air correction qubits and other
533.6,2.88,processed qubits
534.64,3.44,so when i say for example that rsa and
536.48,2.24,elliptic curve cryptography can be
538.08,3.52,broken by
538.72,3.92,2500 to 4 000 cubits i'm referring to
541.6,3.04,logical qubits
542.64,3.68,that algorithm may need 10 million
544.64,3.36,physical cubits to actually run the
546.32,3.36,shallowness and depth of the circuit
548.0,3.68,also play a role in how many supporting
549.68,3.68,qubits you need a shallow algorithm like
551.68,3.04,variational quantum eigensolver will
553.36,2.08,need a lot less of these supporting
554.72,3.04,qubits
555.44,3.28,so what is a bad qubit and what is a bad
557.76,2.8,quantum computer
558.72,3.44,we have the divincenzo criteria which
560.56,2.8,talks about the physical implementation
562.16,2.56,of a quantum computer
563.36,3.28,also note this doesn't talk about what
564.72,3.84,the quantum computer can do but just the
566.64,2.96,physical details the implementation of
568.56,2.48,the hardware itself
569.6,2.799,and i'll link the original paper down
571.04,3.52,below in the description so the
572.399,4.241,dimensions of criteria has five points
574.56,4.32,number one we need a scalable physical
576.64,4.24,system with well characterized qubits
578.88,3.84,so we need physical qubits a two level
580.88,3.76,system that can be entangled
582.72,3.119,that we know the internal parameters of
584.64,3.36,and that we can control
585.839,3.281,number two the ability to initialize the
588.0,2.56,state of qubits
589.12,3.52,so we have to be able to put these
590.56,4.08,qubits in initial states accurately
592.64,3.759,a lot of error with initializing qubits
594.64,3.28,to their beginning state means a lot of
596.399,2.481,error down the road when we actually do
597.92,3.2,the calculation
598.88,3.92,number three long coherence times which
601.12,3.2,are much longer than the amount that we
602.8,3.44,need to do a gate operation
604.32,2.959,the length of coherence or the amount of
606.24,2.64,time that you want the quantum
607.279,3.361,information to be stored needs to
608.88,3.92,increase the more gates that you do
610.64,4.08,number four a universal set of quantum
612.8,3.76,gates for classical computers if you
614.72,3.04,have a gate set that's called universal
616.56,1.44,it means that when you put together
617.76,1.92,those
618.0,3.76,gates we can express any boolean
619.68,3.839,function so for quantum computers it's
621.76,3.199,universal if we can approximate any
623.519,3.121,unitary transformation
624.959,3.361,a unitary transformation is a
626.64,2.96,transformation that preserves the inner
628.32,2.32,product which is a property of the
629.6,2.96,hilbert space
630.64,3.12,and number five a qubit-specific
632.56,3.04,measurement capability
633.76,3.92,we have to be able to measure individual
635.6,3.84,qubits trapped ions and superconducting
637.68,3.76,qubits do really well on all five of
639.44,3.519,these divinchenzo criteria so that's why
641.44,3.36,a lot of companies are using them
642.959,3.12,but there's definitely other contenders
644.8,2.719,there's others that we haven't done a
646.079,3.121,lot of research on so maybe in the
647.519,3.361,future they'll be better candidates
649.2,3.199,so first the cubes themselves actually
650.88,3.04,have to be good but we also need to
652.399,2.0,connect these qubits and have them work
653.92,2.08,together
654.399,3.521,so how do we measure the goodness of the
656.0,3.76,whole quantum chip ibm has come up with
657.92,3.52,a metric called quantum volume and other
659.76,3.44,companies have started using it as well
661.44,3.2,so quantum volume is a single number but
663.2,3.44,it weighs different factors of the
664.64,3.759,quantum chip to measure the performance
666.64,3.84,it uses many more features of a quantum
668.399,4.161,computer including number of qubits
670.48,3.919,and gate and measurement errors and the
672.56,3.36,crosstalk and the topology or
674.399,3.041,connectedness of the quantum chip
675.92,2.88,and this metric was introduced because
677.44,3.36,the number of transistors like in a
678.8,2.88,classical computer doesn't directly map
680.8,2.96,to quantum bits
681.68,3.12,qubits actually decohere or lose that
683.76,3.199,quantum information
684.8,4.159,very quickly a few super fault tolerant
686.959,3.681,qubits with long coherence times that
688.959,2.32,have good gait fidelities and are fully
690.64,2.639,connected
691.279,3.761,are so much more valuable than hundreds
693.279,3.521,of poorly connected qubits with lots of
695.04,3.44,noise and crosstalk so as you see with
696.8,3.76,this quantum volume definition
698.48,4.16,we actually see that the honeywell h1
700.56,3.36,has a higher quantum volume than the ibm
702.64,2.96,27 qubit machine
703.92,3.039,so hopefully next time that you read an
705.6,2.0,article about a quantum computing
706.959,2.241,breakthrough
707.6,3.359,you ask some really deep and serious
709.2,3.439,questions what's the type of quantum
710.959,3.44,computer what's the hardware
712.639,3.521,what are the error rates and what's the
714.399,3.12,topology so if you feel like this video
716.16,3.2,is helpful to you please
717.519,3.681,like this video i appreciate it a lot
719.36,5.039,and subscribe for more videos on quantum
