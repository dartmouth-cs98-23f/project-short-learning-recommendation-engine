second,duration,transcript
10.559,4.681,all right thanks for being here nice to
12.78,4.74,be midway through Midway
15.24,4.08,I'll be talking about pragmatic
17.52,4.56,algorithm game algorithmic game theory
19.32,4.56,which is a talk I gave at the acmec
22.08,5.459,conference I adapted a little bit for
23.88,5.52,you guys but uh just a bit so so let me
27.539,3.421,start by saying what what algorithmic
29.4,2.94,game theory means particularly to that
30.96,4.619,Community
32.34,5.52,um so there was this famous book uh this
35.579,5.16,edited book called algorithmic game
37.86,5.46,theory that ended up uh being sort of an
40.739,6.121,early Point around which this field
43.32,5.34,gelled and it described itself as being
46.86,3.179,research it described this topic of
48.66,3.12,algorithmic Game Theory as being about
50.039,3.661,research at the interface of computer
51.78,4.98,science game theory and economic theory
53.7,4.62,largely motivated by the internet so if
56.76,3.54,you look at the kind of work that that
58.32,3.059,was proposed not just in that book but
60.3,3.899,in work that has called itself
61.379,4.381,algorithmic gain Theory afterwards
64.199,3.001,um it seems that this community is
65.76,3.96,particularly interested in the design of
67.2,6.06,new mechanisms particularly but not only
69.72,5.7,auctions and Market mechanisms trying to
73.26,3.719,analyze existing mechanisms and figure
75.42,3.18,out something about what they do
76.979,3.721,particularly prominent example is
78.6,4.8,sponsored search where the mechanism
80.7,4.38,kind of predates a formalized design
83.4,4.14,approach but then there's a question
85.08,4.74,about what what happens in it and
87.54,4.74,equilibrium computation which of course
89.82,5.28,is a kind of of both a very fundamental
92.28,4.32,computational problem and a kind of
95.1,3.36,Bedrock tool that you would want to use
96.6,4.5,in a lot of this kind of analysis
98.46,5.159,so typically this community has gone for
101.1,6.12,very general settings and attacked them
103.619,5.281,theoretically as indeed we're all kind
107.22,3.719,of familiar both in economics and
108.9,4.679,computer science
110.939,4.68,um and uh I think they've added a lot
113.579,3.421,over the traditional economic kinds of
115.619,4.32,analysis
117.0,5.579,um yielding um both impossibility and
119.939,4.741,optimality results which maybe aren't
122.579,4.14,that uh different from what economists
124.68,3.38,would expect to see the same kinds of
126.719,4.38,things economists have proven for years
128.06,5.44,but added to that kind of
131.099,5.941,um repertoire also that the perspective
133.5,5.04,of approximation and uh I I think really
137.04,2.58,kind of move the ball down the field a
138.54,2.94,bit from the perspective of
139.62,3.6,approximation showing you know for
141.48,3.78,example that they can achieve something
143.22,4.08,close to Optimal Revenue with a simple
145.26,4.8,mechanism or something like that
147.3,4.14,and so so broadly speaking this is what
150.06,3.06,I mean when I say algorithm and Game
151.44,4.68,Theory this kind of field
153.12,5.28,um mostly within CS but but very much in
156.12,3.06,communication with economics
158.4,2.16,um
159.18,3.36,unfortunately I think this field
160.56,4.259,struggles uh of course as any
162.54,4.14,theoretical discipline does
164.819,3.841,um with obtaining
166.68,4.38,um the same kinds of clean theoretical
168.66,4.92,results that address a complex and
171.06,3.959,realistic problems so there tends to be
173.58,3.36,this sort of boundary of analytic
175.019,5.94,tractability Beyond which it's it's hard
176.94,5.579,to go and this approximation framework
180.959,3.06,makes it possible maybe to go further
182.519,3.421,than one might expect but but
184.019,3.72,nevertheless there there sometimes is
185.94,4.5,this experience of hitting a wall and
187.739,4.381,going to uh to something more pregnant
190.44,4.32,more practical
192.12,4.74,so the perspective that I'm going to
194.76,3.899,Advocate today is what I'm calling a
196.86,5.879,pragmatic approach to algorithmic Game
198.659,5.281,Theory and what I want to argue uh you
202.739,3.301,know what I did argue to that Community
203.94,3.719,what I'm what I want to argue to those
206.04,3.96,of you here who see yourself as part of
207.659,4.981,that Community is that it's possible to
210.0,4.08,get more traction on realistic problems
212.64,3.84,that one should be interested in by
214.08,5.04,leveraging 100 or both of two kinds of
216.48,4.56,pragmatism and the first is to care
219.12,3.899,about getting good performance only on
221.04,4.08,problems of interest rather than in
223.019,5.64,relatively unconstrained settings so to
225.12,5.64,try to drill into much narrower and but
228.659,3.061,nevertheless useful categories of
230.76,3.08,problems
231.72,4.86,and the second is to
233.84,6.16,achieve success in statistical rather
236.58,5.64,than analytical terms and so so this
240.0,4.86,means to to adopt a kind of data-driven
242.22,4.2,approach in one's work where the
244.86,4.32,problems of Interest might be defined
246.42,4.62,implicitly by a data set that that gives
249.18,4.08,examples of the kinds of problems one
251.04,4.14,cares about and or there may be
253.26,3.479,data-driven measures of performance so
255.18,3.059,we might be scored on some kind of
256.739,3.921,average measure of performance over a
258.239,4.261,data set rather than simply
260.66,4.599,approving a theorem that says something
262.5,4.44,about how close to optimality we've come
265.259,3.361,um so all of this you can sort of see as
266.94,3.42,a sort of machine learning perspective
268.62,3.84,about how to do
270.36,4.8,um work at the boundary of economics and
272.46,4.08,community and computer science
275.16,2.88,so
276.54,4.2,um in this talk I'm going to talk about
278.04,4.98,work that I've done with collaborators
280.74,4.98,that attacks problems that are kind of
283.02,4.619,core algorithmic Game Theory problems
285.72,3.12,um in the sense that they're the same
287.639,3.241,problems that the algorithmic game
288.84,3.84,theory Community has been itself
290.88,3.599,interested in a more theoretical vein
292.68,4.38,but but that's pragmatic in both of
294.479,5.461,these ways and before launching in let
297.06,3.96,me just say the obvious that I I
299.94,2.699,certainly don't mean to give the
301.02,3.239,impression that I've invented the notion
302.639,5.041,of being pragmatic about algorithmic
304.259,5.641,Game Theory there are many others uh in
307.68,4.799,in this computer science economics
309.9,4.079,Community who do the same and indeed I
312.479,3.241,think one reason that I'm really happy
313.979,3.78,to be at this Workshop is I think that
315.72,3.479,most of you here seem to have this kind
317.759,3.961,of sensibility about the work that you
319.199,4.921,do so I hope that makes you a receptive
321.72,3.96,audience and probably the only way I
324.12,2.7,could really piss you off and lose you
325.68,2.459,would be if I gave you the impression
326.82,2.819,that I was the only one doing this so
328.139,3.661,let me let me reassure you that that's
329.639,3.84,not what I think
331.8,4.2,um so so in particular I'm going to talk
333.479,4.021,about three different lines of work uh
336.0,3.12,you can see them up at the Top If you
337.5,4.22,have good eyes
339.12,5.4,um the the first one I'll talk about is
341.72,5.259,repurposing uh radio spectrum via what's
344.52,4.56,called an incentive auction uh which is
346.979,5.101,something the FCC is in the progress of
349.08,4.26,doing as they do these kind of slides
352.08,3.839,along the way I'm just going to kind of
353.34,5.46,call out my collaborators so my PhD
355.919,4.861,student Alexandra frechette is my main
358.8,4.339,collaborator here and Frank Hunter
360.78,5.22,holder who's lingshu and Steve ramage
363.139,4.961,contributed in to some of the tools that
366.0,4.56,I used in this work
368.1,3.96,so you guys have probably heard about
370.56,3.9,the incentive auction but let me just
372.06,4.32,say just a little bit about it so the
374.46,3.12,FCC had this great idea of having an
376.38,4.319,auction that had something to do with
377.58,4.619,incentives well no that's not quite it
380.699,2.28,um but but the FCC
382.199,2.94,um
382.979,5.16,yeah what a great name right I don't
385.139,5.4,know but uh but but anyway that's what
388.139,5.28,they call it so what can I do about that
390.539,5.22,um the FC the FCC wants to basically
393.419,4.56,sell off radio spectrum to uh mobile
395.759,3.901,phone companies as they do
397.979,3.301,um the problem that they face is that
399.66,3.42,they've kind of already sold all of it
401.28,4.44,there just isn't really good radio
403.08,4.98,spectrum to sell anymore and people
405.72,3.9,still want to watch cat videos on their
408.06,4.259,phones while they're on the subway so so
409.62,3.9,we've got a problem and the solution to
412.319,3.421,this problem
413.52,4.38,um is to take radio spectrum that's
415.74,5.28,being used for something else and
417.9,4.68,repurpose it for use uh in uh in Mobile
421.02,3.78,phones because that's the use that
422.58,4.5,people now care about and in particular
424.8,4.14,it turns out that television you know
427.08,4.38,back in the day when when broadcast
428.94,4.74,television started up it got given
431.46,4.98,really awesome radio spectrum because
433.68,5.4,that it was kind of the the big game in
436.44,4.199,town and now broadcast television is not
439.08,3.72,that important to people people are much
440.639,5.701,more interested in in getting Television
442.8,6.299,over cable or satellite or you know even
446.34,4.44,over the Internet so so it seems like
449.099,3.72,maybe there's there's some economic
450.78,4.199,efficiency gains to be had here by by
452.819,4.621,taking back some of that spectrum and
454.979,3.541,and selling it off to uh to mobile phone
457.44,3.96,companies where it can be used more
458.52,5.519,productively of course the catch here is
461.4,4.919,it's not I'm not a lawyer I'm I don't
464.039,3.6,fully understand the legal side of these
466.319,3.72,things about whether this is necessary
467.639,4.321,or just a good idea but it's at the very
470.039,4.5,least a good idea not to just confiscate
471.96,5.4,this spectrum from the the television
474.539,4.681,stations and and give it back to to the
477.36,4.32,mobile phone companies in order to make
479.22,4.62,this all go down in a sensible way uh it
481.68,5.1,turns out that what one needs to do is
483.84,5.28,to buy the the radio spectrum back from
486.78,3.9,the television stations uh in order to
489.12,3.6,be able to then sell it off to the
490.68,3.72,mobile phone companies so this gives
492.72,3.06,rise to the question of how you would go
494.4,2.639,about doing that how are you going to
495.78,3.96,buy back
497.039,3.66,um the the right to broadcast from a
499.74,3.66,whole bunch of different television
500.699,4.62,stations all of which operate you know
503.4,3.479,at particular powers on particular
505.319,4.081,Channel bills in particular from
506.879,4.561,particular antennas in given regions of
509.4,4.319,the country in this crazy Patchwork all
511.44,4.2,over the United States and you know one
513.719,4.081,by one get different ones of them to
515.64,4.259,sell back their their right to broadcast
517.8,4.02,and somehow assemble this into something
519.899,4.38,that that a mobile phone company would
521.82,4.019,be interested in buying so so that's the
524.279,3.721,the kind of underlying optimization
525.839,3.661,problem that that is going to form the
528.0,3.0,allocation problem for for this
529.5,3.0,incentive option
531.0,3.6,so
532.5,3.839,um so I can tell you this this auction
534.6,4.679,is now approved and ready to go you can
536.339,4.981,see this is the report and order that
539.279,4.5,the Federal Communications Commission
541.32,3.6,um just put out uh announcing that this
543.779,2.481,was going to happen and giving some
544.92,4.08,details about how it's going to happen
546.26,4.24,uh you can see it was just a little over
549.0,4.26,a month ago that this happened so this
550.5,4.86,is a really current thing uh the the
553.26,3.84,reported order makes really entertaining
555.36,4.8,reading I recommend that you sit down
557.1,6.78,with it it's uh 488 pages long and it's
560.16,5.28,written almost entirely by lawyers so
563.88,3.24,um so I think it's great I mean you know
565.44,3.839,you here at a business school presumably
567.12,5.1,do this kind of thing all the time so
569.279,5.341,you know that should be fun for you
572.22,3.84,um but uh you know in case you're not
574.62,3.899,going to read it let me just tell you a
576.06,3.959,little bit about what it would say uh
578.519,3.901,yeah I can sort of put in one slide with
580.019,4.38,the 488 Pages safe from your point of
582.42,4.8,view as economists
584.399,4.56,um essentially there are going to be two
587.22,4.92,different auctions that will happen in a
588.959,4.621,linked way so there'll be a reverse
592.14,3.06,um or descending price auction for
593.58,3.96,broadcasters and in the reverse auction
595.2,5.22,essentially what's going to happen is
597.54,5.58,stations will be offered some very high
600.42,5.039,reserve price to stop being television
603.12,5.82,stations and instead to be people with
605.459,5.281,bags of money and they'll they'll say
608.94,4.14,yes I would take your large bag of money
610.74,6.12,in exchange for not being a television
613.08,5.58,station anymore and the FCC will look at
616.86,4.08,all of these offers to stop broadcasting
618.66,4.02,and and determine that it would be
620.94,3.899,possible to get rid of a whole bunch of
622.68,4.32,spectrum if that were true it would be
624.839,4.68,possible to take all of the TV stations
627.0,4.14,that go up to channel 52 and change that
629.519,3.781,to TV stations that only go up to
631.14,3.54,channel 30 and then they could take that
633.3,3.84,radio spectrum that was used for
634.68,4.74,channels 31 up to 52
637.14,3.3,except for channel 37 if you're one of
639.42,2.28,the people who understands how these
640.44,2.459,things work
641.7,3.3,um turns out there's something special
642.899,4.081,going on there radio telescopes need to
645.0,4.26,operate on channel 37.
646.98,3.72,um and uh and you take that big block
649.26,3.0,and then you can sell that off to the
650.7,3.66,cell phone companies because what cell
652.26,3.78,phones need is a big contiguous block of
654.36,3.419,spectrum they they can't operate on
656.04,4.739,little corners of spectrum in different
657.779,4.62,geographical regions so so then you do
660.779,2.881,that but then you've probably gotten too
662.399,3.18,many people who are willing to accept
663.66,3.299,big amounts of money so then you start
665.579,3.301,lowering the amount of money that you're
666.959,3.06,offering everybody and as the this
668.88,3.44,amount of money that you're offering
670.019,5.161,goes down at some point high value
672.32,4.84,participants might say I'm not so happy
675.18,3.54,anymore to accept your reduced amount of
677.16,3.119,money I would rather go back to being a
678.72,4.02,television station and they they would
680.279,3.961,go back on the air you'd you'd confirm
682.74,2.76,that it's still possible to put them
684.24,3.48,somewhere
685.5,4.74,and uh and you kind of keep doing this
687.72,4.859,until everybody uh you know either is is
690.24,3.9,being paid nothing or is indispensable
692.579,4.5,to you and can't be put back on the air
694.14,4.74,I'll show you that uh schematically in a
697.079,2.82,minute you know why why do you have to
698.88,2.04,go through the government to make this
699.899,2.88,happen
700.92,4.56,um the real reason is
702.779,4.62,um let's say I'm a television station
705.48,5.28,um in let's say right now I'm channel
707.399,5.94,13. so or let's make me a UHF station
710.76,4.139,and Sam Channel 15. um you know that's
713.339,4.68,not a piece of spectrum that's going to
714.899,5.101,get given to the radio uh to the uh the
718.019,3.121,telecoms but instead what could happen
720.0,3.6,is
721.14,4.259,um you could take this and take somebody
723.6,3.239,else who is in a useful piece of
725.399,3.481,spectrum and kind of stick him into my
726.839,4.201,spot on this ability to move around
728.88,4.32,stations uh is something that only the
731.04,3.9,government can do and fundamentally
733.2,4.02,that's needed to get big contiguous
734.94,4.44,blocks of usable Spectrum so so the
737.22,3.66,government is telling the top the TV
739.38,3.899,stations you know this is a one-time
740.88,3.84,chance for you to participate in this
743.279,2.941,auction and I think that's a pretty
744.72,4.32,plausible thing to say because this
746.22,4.38,repacking is uh you know it really has
749.04,2.82,to happen on a national scale to be
750.6,2.7,useful
751.86,3.12,um and you know the government only can
753.3,3.24,do this you know they're going to cause
754.98,3.299,slightly different interference on the
756.54,3.0,stations that get repacked they can only
758.279,3.601,do this because they've been given
759.54,5.78,Authority by a law so this can't really
761.88,3.44,happen just just on the side
765.48,3.96,um so this is the reverse auction the
767.7,4.62,forward auction is then taking this
769.44,4.56,stuff and selling it off to the um to
772.32,3.42,the cell phone companies so so here
774.0,4.38,we're going to have different licenses
775.74,3.96,uh in every region and the prices for
778.38,3.12,these licenses are going to increase
779.7,4.199,until
781.5,3.48,um uh supply and demand meet so you're
783.899,2.221,going to have just a much more
784.98,2.18,straightforward kind of ascending
786.12,4.14,auction
787.16,4.239,this is not absolutely trivial but this
790.26,3.36,is kind of the sort of thing that the
791.399,4.801,FCC has been doing for a long time
793.62,4.62,um all right so so we have this reverse
796.2,3.78,auction we have a forward auction and
798.24,4.32,then we have we have some kind of link
799.98,4.2,between them uh so we have we have some
802.56,3.959,amount of Revenue that we need to
804.18,4.62,achieve to to make everybody happy about
806.519,5.521,what what just happened and if that
808.8,4.68,hasn't happened then basically we
812.04,4.26,um we decided that we were trying to
813.48,4.62,clear too much spectrum and so then we
816.3,3.42,we reduce the amount of spectrum that
818.1,3.9,we're trying to clear and that will have
819.72,3.96,the effect of both lowering the prices
822.0,4.139,that we have to pay because we have to
823.68,4.56,buy out fewer TVs stations and
826.139,4.26,increasing the the per unit prices that
828.24,4.02,we will end up charging telecoms because
830.399,4.081,the supply will have gotten scarcer and
832.26,3.96,so the prices will continue to rise and
834.48,3.539,so so essentially what we'll do is we'll
836.22,3.0,we'll just change the amount of spectrum
838.019,2.76,that we have to clear and then keep
839.22,3.179,running the auction you might notice
840.779,3.781,that these two prices are not directly
842.399,4.38,related to each other right so so this
844.56,4.14,is not a double-sided Market
846.779,3.421,um or if it's a double-sided Market it's
848.7,3.66,very indirectly a double-sided Market
850.2,3.96,because kind of what's happening is the
852.36,4.14,government is you know doing this one
854.16,4.44,auction with everybody and getting all
856.5,3.3,these goods and then kind of glomming
858.6,3.179,them together and turning them into
859.8,3.96,something else and selling them to
861.779,3.661,somebody else so the government gets to
863.76,3.78,keep whatever the difference is and they
865.44,3.48,the Congressional budget office has
867.54,2.7,projected that that difference is 25
868.92,4.02,billion dollars
870.24,3.899,so so the government's take is is a
872.94,2.579,bunch of money
874.139,2.76,so let me tell you a little bit more
875.519,3.961,about the reverse auction which is going
876.899,3.961,to be my focus I found in talking to
879.48,2.64,people that there seems to be a lot of
880.86,2.76,misunderstanding about how this auction
882.12,3.0,works and so
883.62,4.019,um maybe you guys all understand it but
885.12,4.68,I made a very sophisticated PowerPoint
887.639,5.64,animation to explain how this works
889.8,5.64,and and I say this both jokingly and not
893.279,3.36,um I say it jokingly in the sense that
895.44,3.839,when you see it you're going to be
896.639,4.44,disappointed but but I say it seriously
899.279,3.24,in the sense that it took me forever to
901.079,3.841,make
902.519,4.201,this so let's see
904.92,4.2,um so so it turns out that rather than
906.72,4.02,talking about uh buying our television
909.12,3.06,stations which turns out for various
910.74,2.279,reasons to be a little hard to think
912.18,3.0,about
913.019,3.361,um abstractly I'm going to switch to a
915.18,3.54,problem that I think you have more
916.38,5.699,experience with which is the problem of
918.72,6.96,uh Airline over booking right so so you
922.079,5.76,go to the uh your airline of choice and
925.68,3.659,they say you know sorry remember that
927.839,3.18,ticket we sold you for the flight that
929.339,4.381,you're on well it doesn't really
931.019,4.141,correspond to a seat on our plane
933.72,3.059,um in fact you know it turns out there's
935.16,4.38,this law that for some reason we can
936.779,4.021,sell you things that don't exist and if
939.54,3.06,you don't show up for the flight that we
940.8,3.36,keep your money but if we don't have a
942.6,3.9,seat for you that's just too bad for you
944.16,3.96,and now we're gonna see what happens so
946.5,3.6,so let's think about the part of what
948.12,3.42,happens and and in fact what really
950.1,3.299,happens is they just screw you in your
951.54,3.299,strand in Chicago but let's imagine
953.399,4.5,something slightly more reasonable that
954.839,5.701,involves an auction so so the way this
957.899,4.141,is going to work is uh and and for
960.54,3.78,reasons that have to do with this FCC
962.04,4.08,action I'm I'm going to ask that
964.32,3.84,passengers either fly in the cabin
966.12,3.74,they're assigned to or they have to give
968.16,3.96,up their seat I'm not going to allow
969.86,4.06,passengers in first class to move to
972.12,3.3,economy class I'll explain afterwards
973.92,4.38,why that's important
975.42,4.74,so the feasibility constraint that I'm
978.3,3.659,going to have as an airline is that the
980.16,3.06,number of passengers in each cabin is
981.959,3.24,less than or equal to the number of
983.22,3.78,seats I have because I can't fly with
985.199,4.681,people standing up
987.0,4.38,um someday they'll do that but not yet
989.88,4.44,um and I'll use a descending clock
991.38,4.56,auction to set compensations and the way
994.32,3.0,to think about this is I start with a
995.94,4.139,plan that's big enough to hold everybody
997.32,6.0,so so these dots which I individually
1000.079,6.661,placed with my mouse are the people and
1003.32,5.34,this is my plan right so this by analogy
1006.74,4.2,is the current state of affairs with
1008.66,3.84,with television stations they're all
1010.94,2.819,kind of all the television stations have
1012.5,3.12,somewhere to broadcast
1013.759,3.841,the problem is we're going to get rid of
1015.62,3.779,a bunch of the spots right we're gonna
1017.6,3.06,this is clearing a bunch of spectrum
1019.399,3.961,we're going to lose a bunch of the seats
1020.66,4.139,and now we have people without seats
1023.36,3.059,um and and this is where the airline
1024.799,3.241,decides hey we could send a smaller plan
1026.419,4.5,and save ourselves some money
1028.04,4.62,so uh the airline offers compensation so
1030.919,4.081,we say to everybody we'll give you a
1032.66,4.86,thousand dollars if um
1035.0,4.439,uh if you just elect not to fly and
1037.52,3.12,we'll we'll fly you tomorrow morning and
1039.439,2.76,everybody gets to make a choice about
1040.64,4.26,whether that sounds good to them or not
1042.199,4.201,and so some people say no I'm going to
1044.9,3.0,hold on to my seat I'm not going to take
1046.4,3.84,your thousand dollars and they're
1047.9,4.32,they're on the plane and some people say
1050.24,4.38,a thousand dollars would be great why
1052.22,4.14,not I'll do it and and they kind of go
1054.62,3.0,off to the side here and and so here's
1056.36,3.12,our state of affairs with a thousand
1057.62,3.84,dollars the thing to notice now is that
1059.48,4.68,I've got a lot of empty seats so as an
1061.46,4.56,airline I think Hmm these guys you know
1064.16,3.78,don't don't seem to Value money all that
1066.02,4.44,highly I made a bit of a mistake
1067.94,4.26,offering them a thousand dollars so let
1070.46,3.36,me let me change my offer so you say to
1072.2,3.18,everybody remember what that thing I
1073.82,2.94,said about a thousand dollars really I
1075.38,3.72,was lying it's only eight hundred
1076.76,5.4,dollars how do you feel about that
1079.1,4.38,and uh and some of them say well you
1082.16,2.94,know turns out I only did it because you
1083.48,3.42,said a thousand dollars in fact I want
1085.1,4.68,to go back on your stupid plane
1086.9,5.279,and uh and so now some of them move back
1089.78,4.56,and and in fact In First Class
1092.179,3.421,um let's say they all move back so so
1094.34,3.78,what's going to happen in this auction
1095.6,3.9,then is these guys now these blue dots
1098.12,2.52,have nowhere they can go on the plane
1099.5,3.78,because I'm not going to let them go to
1100.64,4.2,a different class and so that means
1103.28,3.48,they've accepted an offer for eight
1104.84,3.54,hundred dollars but I can't make them
1106.76,3.24,any subsequent offers because I can't
1108.38,3.9,back that offer up with anything if I
1110.0,4.2,was to offer them 700 and they said I
1112.28,3.3,won't take your offer I would be in the
1114.2,3.359,embarrassing situation of not being able
1115.58,3.839,to do anything so so I have to freeze
1117.559,4.261,them at the last offer they accepted
1119.419,4.341,these other guys though I can still do
1121.82,5.16,without so for them I lowered the price
1123.76,5.2,and then some of them move back and then
1126.98,4.38,I lower the price again and then some of
1128.96,4.14,them move back and until something
1131.36,3.36,freezes again and now the green guys are
1133.1,3.42,frozen because again there are no spots
1134.72,5.579,for them so I freeze them at a different
1136.52,5.039,price the blue guys are just gluttons
1140.299,3.841,for punishment that's why they're flying
1141.559,3.961,an economy class so we just keep on
1144.14,3.899,hitting them with lower and lower prices
1145.52,4.2,and some of them move back like the
1148.039,4.081,suckers they are they'll even take 300
1149.72,3.66,and eventually two hundred dollars a
1152.12,4.2,couple of them move back and these guys
1153.38,4.26,get Frozen and so so this is how the
1156.32,2.359,auction works so basically we're going
1157.64,3.36,to keep on
1158.679,4.36,lowering prices on people as long as
1161.0,3.98,it's possible to accommodate them back
1163.039,4.38,where they were before and then
1164.98,4.3,basically the the willingness of other
1167.419,3.841,people to eventually
1169.28,3.42,um participate in the auction or quit is
1171.26,3.6,what's going to drive the prices for you
1172.7,3.9,okay so so what does this correspond to
1174.86,3.3,in reality you might think this
1176.6,2.819,corresponds to sort of good spectrum and
1178.16,3.6,medium spectrum and bad Spectrum but
1179.419,3.661,that's that's really not true what I
1181.76,3.539,want this instead to correspond to is
1183.08,3.839,different places so there's nothing
1185.299,3.061,special about first class you know it
1186.919,4.26,might have been the first class got a
1188.36,4.14,worse price than business glass what's
1191.179,2.581,really special is that you can only go
1192.5,3.299,back to the place that you originally
1193.76,4.02,were and and that they're just different
1195.799,3.481,constraints in different places so let's
1197.78,3.66,say first class was really New York
1199.28,3.6,economy class sorry guys it's the
1201.44,4.38,Midwest
1202.88,4.32,um and uh and so we just had different
1205.82,3.54,feasibility constraints in different
1207.2,3.599,places right so so it might be that New
1209.36,2.699,York kind of walks up early because
1210.799,3.0,there are a lot of constraints in the
1212.059,3.181,New York Region where prices are just
1213.799,4.141,falling and falling in Chicago because
1215.24,4.92,you have lots of open space out here
1217.94,3.9,um now now here's the the thing about
1220.16,4.379,the real problem the feasibility
1221.84,6.12,constraints in fact are a crazy jumbled
1224.539,4.801,mess right so so this is a picture of
1227.96,3.0,the feasibility constraints it might be
1229.34,3.48,a picture made by Nick actually I'm not
1230.96,3.599,sure did you make this picture
1232.82,3.3,thanks for the picture Nick I never
1234.559,3.0,thanked you properly I want to take this
1236.12,4.04,opportunity
1237.559,6.301,um so yeah okay that that was special
1240.16,4.96,okay so so this is uh this is a
1243.86,2.88,visualization of the real constraint
1245.12,3.0,graph and and what you can see from this
1246.74,3.66,is just kind of that it sucks right
1248.12,3.78,there's just lots of lines everywhere
1250.4,3.24,um but but in particular what you can
1251.9,3.6,sort of Imagine from this picture is you
1253.64,4.14,know every dot is a station right and a
1255.5,3.6,line is these two stations somehow
1257.78,3.48,constrain each other on what what
1259.1,5.22,channels they're allowed to be on
1261.26,5.76,um and and because there's just not a
1264.32,4.26,lot of nice kind of symmetric cliques in
1267.02,3.539,this graph everything has just got weird
1268.58,4.56,stuff hanging off the side and that
1270.559,4.261,means that it then my nice story about
1273.14,2.94,kind of everyone in economy class is the
1274.82,2.94,same and everyone in business class is
1276.08,3.3,the same is not going to be true in this
1277.76,3.48,graph the question of whether you can
1279.38,3.72,personally go back is going to be a a
1281.24,3.84,personalized choice for everybody
1283.1,4.14,the point means there exists a
1285.08,4.44,constraint between those two stations
1287.24,4.559,that either they can't be on the same
1289.52,4.68,channel they can't be on adjacent
1291.799,3.901,channels they can't be on certain same
1294.2,3.66,or adjacent channels but they're allowed
1295.7,4.5,to be on other ones or some combination
1297.86,5.1,of those sorts of constraints
1300.2,4.5,um and and there are many channels so so
1302.96,3.54,you know typically we're not going to
1304.7,4.68,clear all the Spectrum so is there any
1306.5,4.559,two channels linked by an edge can still
1309.38,2.7,both be accommodated but you know
1311.059,2.761,eventually they're going to start to
1312.08,3.54,constrain each other as I reduce the set
1313.82,4.859,of available channels
1315.62,5.34,so so here's another visualization of
1318.679,4.401,this graph which uh is maybe a little
1320.96,4.32,bit easier to think about because
1323.08,3.219,this one has the advantage that it looks
1325.28,3.06,like the United States but the
1326.299,4.62,disadvantage that you can't see just how
1328.34,4.56,awful the New York Region really is
1330.919,4.441,um it's really awful it has some nodes
1332.9,3.96,with degrees above 200 so so there's
1335.36,3.12,some really really densely connected
1336.86,3.72,parts of this graph
1338.48,3.179,um this just sort of blows it out in a
1340.58,2.88,way that gives you a better sense of the
1341.659,3.541,connectivity of the graph
1343.46,3.36,um so so there's this underlying
1345.2,3.3,computational problem if I want to do
1346.82,3.18,this kind of Airline algorithm the way I
1348.5,5.76,showed it to you this descending clock
1350.0,5.64,auction which is asking for a given set
1354.26,2.46,of people that I think are going to
1355.64,3.24,participate in the auction that have
1356.72,3.54,currently accepted going off air and
1358.88,3.24,another set of people that I have to
1360.26,4.26,repack because they've exited the
1362.12,6.48,auction or they never participated is it
1364.52,5.7,possible for me to also not take you for
1368.6,4.439,every given person is it possible for me
1370.22,4.439,to put you back on the air and somehow
1373.039,3.901,readjust the stations I give to
1374.659,5.041,everybody so the the whole thing works
1376.94,5.099,and if so I get to lower your price and
1379.7,3.959,if not then you're Frozen and I have to
1382.039,2.581,take the last price you accepted in a
1383.659,1.921,sense you're not participating in the
1384.62,2.939,auction anymore
1385.58,3.78,and and so this is this computational
1387.559,3.961,problem that I'm going to have to answer
1389.36,3.78,every time I want to consider lowering a
1391.52,3.12,price for every single station so I'm
1393.14,3.419,going to have to do this you know kind
1394.64,3.18,of on the order of 2000 times every time
1396.559,3.541,I take the clock
1397.82,3.78,and uh you know bad news this is the
1400.1,3.78,part where computer scientists come and
1401.6,3.9,bum you out because uh this is an NP
1403.88,3.659,complete problem
1405.5,3.96,um which the theorists will tell you
1407.539,3.361,means that you should go shoot yourself
1409.46,2.76,in the corner because nothing can be
1410.9,3.12,dealt with Chicago somebody can shoot
1412.22,3.0,you for you you don't have to do it
1414.02,4.56,yourself
1415.22,5.04,um but you should be very sad uh the
1418.58,3.3,pragmatic truth is just because the
1420.26,3.36,problem is NP complete doesn't mean you
1421.88,2.88,can never solve it it just means you
1423.62,3.419,can't be confident that you can always
1424.76,3.6,solve it so so it turns out there are a
1427.039,3.601,whole kind of research communities
1428.36,4.14,within CS about finding practical ways
1430.64,3.659,of solving NP complete problems and they
1432.5,4.02,work all the time you know Google
1434.299,3.841,wouldn't be making a self-driving car if
1436.52,3.48,it weren't possible to solve NP complete
1438.14,3.0,problems with decent reliability all the
1440.0,3.12,time
1441.14,3.0,um you just can't do it absolutely all
1443.12,2.46,the time that's why the car will
1444.14,3.919,sometimes crash
1445.58,2.479,sorry
1448.82,2.16,or something
1450.38,3.24,um
1450.98,5.16,so uh so so here we've got a graph graph
1453.62,4.74,coloring problem with 130 000 um
1456.14,3.659,pairwise relationships between stations
1458.36,4.62,something on the order of a couple of
1459.799,5.641,million uh actual constraints which uh
1462.98,4.26,speak about individual channels
1465.44,3.119,um and the FCC was initially pretty
1467.24,2.88,skeptical about whether this problem
1468.559,3.24,could be solved at a national scale and
1470.12,2.939,they were doing a bunch of pretty hacky
1471.799,2.701,things to try to make the problem
1473.059,3.301,smaller
1474.5,2.64,um in the end uh we're solving this
1476.36,3.179,problem
1477.14,4.38,um exactly and at a national scale using
1479.539,2.88,some tools from empirical algorithmic so
1481.52,4.2,I'll tell you a little bit about how
1482.419,4.861,we're doing that basically the the bunch
1485.72,3.72,of tricks that we've got are to use a
1487.28,4.019,satin coding automatic algorithm
1489.44,3.119,configuration and algorithm portfolio so
1491.299,3.901,I'll tell you kind of a slide about what
1492.559,4.921,each of those things is so okay
1495.2,5.04,um so so what do we do with this thing
1497.48,6.319,um well how many of you know what
1500.24,3.559,propositional satisfiability is
1503.84,3.42,hooray for you okay you guys can get a
1505.58,2.64,coffee I mean they spend like 30 seconds
1507.26,3.18,telling the rest of you what
1508.22,3.72,propositional satisfiability is this is
1510.44,3.359,this is one of the awesome problems in
1511.94,2.94,computer science right this is uh this
1513.799,3.421,is part of the bread and butter of
1514.88,4.52,computer science this is like the you
1517.22,4.319,know Corno
1519.4,4.3,whatever it is Chrono something
1521.539,3.541,something what is that what is it is it
1523.7,3.54,it's like Chrono competition or
1525.08,3.719,something yeah that's why I'm a computer
1527.24,3.299,scientist anyway
1528.799,3.781,um so yeah please edit that part out of
1530.539,4.26,the video we don't know about going on
1532.58,3.3,Milton Friedman would be so unimpressed
1534.799,1.921,with me
1535.88,3.24,um
1536.72,3.959,okay so so basically satisfiability is
1539.12,3.24,what is actually the first problem that
1540.679,3.181,was shown to be NP completers and the
1542.36,3.96,the first little kind of set of problems
1543.86,4.799,and uh it's really easy to think about
1546.32,3.42,because it's so simple and that means
1548.659,3.0,that there are some really powerful
1549.74,3.6,algorithms that work with it because the
1551.659,3.361,the problem itself is so simple that you
1553.34,3.42,can really wrestle with it in great
1555.02,3.899,detail so it's sort of a pure
1556.76,3.659,combinatorial problem it says I've got a
1558.919,4.021,set of variables and each variable can
1560.419,4.321,be true or false then I can make
1562.94,3.3,literals which are the variables that
1564.74,3.72,either the variables themselves or the
1566.24,4.62,negations of the variables I can make
1568.46,4.74,Clauses which are disjunctions of
1570.86,6.0,literals so a clause is something like a
1573.2,5.82,or b or not C right so it's it's a
1576.86,4.199,disjunction of either variables or
1579.02,4.32,negated variables and then I make a
1581.059,4.141,formula which is a conjunction of
1583.34,6.6,Clauses so I end up with something that
1585.2,7.859,looks like a or b or not C and D or e or
1589.94,5.219,not a so I make this whole string of
1593.059,4.381,propositional variables connected with
1595.159,4.921,answers or knots in this particular way
1597.44,4.68,and the question that I then ask is is
1600.08,4.26,there some way of assigning values to
1602.12,4.38,each variable from true or false that
1604.34,3.48,make this whole logic formula evaluate
1606.5,3.6,to true
1607.82,4.32,and you know your first impulse might be
1610.1,4.02,well sure that sounds really easy you
1612.14,3.6,know I just I can just come up with true
1614.12,3.36,and false values and then I I know I
1615.74,3.12,know all about logic right I know how to
1617.48,3.24,evaluate this thing and figure out
1618.86,4.08,whether it's true or false and indeed
1620.72,4.14,it's very easy to to come up with some
1622.94,3.3,assignment of uh true and false values
1624.86,3.299,to all the variables look at it in the
1626.24,4.14,formula figure out if it's true or false
1628.159,4.321,but then you might notice well if I've
1630.38,4.08,got n variables there are two to the N
1632.48,5.46,assignments of of truth values to those
1634.46,5.52,variables and I could try each of them
1637.94,3.54,and test it but is there some more
1639.98,2.88,principled way of figuring out which of
1641.48,4.319,those two to the end things I have to
1642.86,4.559,try or do I have to do all of them well
1645.799,3.061,if you can answer that question then
1647.419,3.0,there's a million dollars waiting for
1648.86,3.299,you at the clay Mathematics Institute
1650.419,4.201,because that would involve answering the
1652.159,5.4,question of whether p is equal to NP and
1654.62,5.7,so we don't know but so far we haven't
1657.559,4.821,found a way so so far more or less you
1660.32,4.5,have to try everything
1662.38,4.6,so this is sort of the combinatory the
1664.82,3.3,the combination lock of combinatorial
1666.98,3.84,problems you just sort of have to to
1668.12,4.14,grind through everything or sort of in
1670.82,3.78,the worst case it seems like you have to
1672.26,3.72,but in practice maybe there's a lot of
1674.6,3.42,structure in your problem right if I
1675.98,5.16,gave you something like
1678.02,4.86,um a or not a and all kinds of other
1681.14,3.419,stuff maybe you could look at that and
1682.88,3.539,say well that's got a contradiction in
1684.559,3.48,it that first Clause simply can't be
1686.419,2.88,satisfied so I don't need to grind
1688.039,3.301,through all the other stuff I can just
1689.299,3.301,spot that contradiction that's a very
1691.34,2.219,simple example of the fact that you
1692.6,3.059,don't always have to grind through
1693.559,3.841,everything and and there are much richer
1695.659,3.361,reasons why you might not have to grind
1697.4,3.899,through everything so that that's this
1699.02,3.96,kind of empirical algorithms framework
1701.299,2.821,you can't do it for for the worst case
1702.98,2.0,input but you can do it for everything
1704.12,4.5,else
1704.98,5.679,so how do we formulate this FTC problem
1708.62,3.539,as a sad problem
1710.659,4.321,um I'll just do this kind of at a high
1712.159,4.681,level but basically we say every station
1714.98,4.62,has to broadcast on one of its allowable
1716.84,4.5,channels that gives me a constraint that
1719.6,4.319,looks like this
1721.34,4.28,um so so one of these at least one of
1723.919,3.841,these variables has to be set to true
1725.62,4.84,the variable which says this day
1727.76,4.74,broadcast on this channel
1730.46,3.599,um so the disjunction of all these
1732.5,3.659,variables has to be true which means at
1734.059,3.781,least one of them has to be true each
1736.159,2.88,station only gets to broadcast on one
1737.84,4.38,channel
1739.039,4.981,um that means and the negation of each
1742.22,5.04,pair of values that station could take
1744.02,4.98,uh disjoint so so at least one of them
1747.26,3.899,has to be false at least one of every
1749.0,4.2,pair has to be false so far those two
1751.159,4.26,things just say every station gets one
1753.2,4.32,channel that doesn't seem like I've done
1755.419,3.421,something very complicated yet
1757.52,2.639,um but the interference thing is the
1758.84,3.719,hard part so then I take all of these
1760.159,4.5,pairwise interference constraints and I
1762.559,3.781,I throw them all in so I say you can't
1764.659,4.441,be on Channel 17 while I'm on channel
1766.34,3.959,18. and I do that two and a half million
1769.1,3.24,times for all of the pairwise
1770.299,3.841,interference constraints and I just
1772.34,3.54,throw them all in there too and then I
1774.14,4.08,give this thing to a SAT solver with it
1775.88,3.779,all of its Glory of tens of thousands of
1778.22,3.36,variables and two and a half million
1779.659,5.52,constraints and
1781.58,5.16,it turns out as a side note that most of
1785.179,3.841,the Clauses have only two variables in
1786.74,4.08,them you'll notice only this first kind
1789.02,3.48,of clause that I gave at the top has
1790.82,3.239,more than two variables in them and
1792.5,3.96,that's a really powerful thing for a SAT
1794.059,4.261,solver because when one of the variable
1796.46,4.02,when one of the literals gets set to
1798.32,3.78,false I can infer that the second one
1800.48,3.6,has to get set to true or the whole
1802.1,3.36,thing's not going to work and that's
1804.08,3.3,that's how I can see the contradiction
1805.46,4.439,doesn't work because if one of them gets
1807.38,3.96,said to false the other one uh
1809.899,2.461,actually the contribution does work
1811.34,2.579,doesn't it
1812.36,2.46,never mind anyway
1813.919,2.521,um
1814.82,3.3,other things don't work
1816.44,3.839,um yeah maybe I don't have a one
1818.12,3.36,variable example but uh but anyway when
1820.279,3.181,one of these things gets set to false
1821.48,3.24,the other one has to be true and then I
1823.46,3.0,know how this thing gets set and it
1824.72,3.179,might appear in other formulas and so
1826.46,3.3,then I can plug in its values in those
1827.899,3.721,other formulas and that can cause other
1829.76,3.36,things to get forced and I can get these
1831.62,3.48,chains in something that's called Unit
1833.12,3.539,propagation where I go grinding through
1835.1,3.24,without having to do search setting all
1836.659,3.781,kinds of variables and that's kind of a
1838.34,3.719,powerful thing so so basically we get
1840.44,3.3,this crazy thing you might think on the
1842.059,3.961,face of it it's so ridiculously big
1843.74,3.6,right I've got like tens of thousands of
1846.02,2.46,variables and in the worst case I think
1847.34,3.12,this thing is exponential in the number
1848.48,3.179,of variables so how could this possibly
1850.46,3.06,work
1851.659,3.301,um the trick we're going to use is
1853.52,3.3,something that my research group has
1854.96,3.54,been working on pretty hard for about a
1856.82,5.64,decade which is called algorithm
1858.5,5.88,configuration and the idea is that
1862.46,3.0,um it it turns out the heuristic
1864.38,2.94,algorithms which is what we're talking
1865.46,3.24,about here algorithms that that don't
1867.32,3.479,come with a worst case performance
1868.7,3.54,guarantee but that sort of embody things
1870.799,4.081,that seem like they should be good ideas
1872.24,5.34,which is what a heuristic is
1874.88,3.84,um tend to have a lot of parameters as
1877.58,3.479,you're building this kind of algorithm
1878.72,4.079,you tend to face a choice about you know
1881.059,3.661,how much pre-processing should I do
1882.799,3.6,should I Branch this way or that way
1884.72,4.559,which variable should I consider first
1886.399,5.64,and the authors of these these
1889.279,4.26,algorithms can and typically do expose
1892.039,3.24,those choices to the end user as
1893.539,4.5,parameters so they can be changed at
1895.279,5.181,runtime so something that you might do
1898.039,4.561,if you know that you have a given
1900.46,4.839,distribution of problems that you need
1902.6,4.079,to attack is to set those parameters in
1905.299,3.36,a way that works particularly well for
1906.679,3.781,your problem so that you effectively
1908.659,5.88,custom design an algorithm that will
1910.46,5.28,work well just for you and so so that
1914.539,3.12,seems good except if you've got
1915.74,4.02,something like 100 parameters you know
1917.659,3.421,setting these things by hand by
1919.76,2.76,repeatedly running the algorithm and
1921.08,3.42,having it take many hours and then
1922.52,4.86,seeing how it did is a pretty hard thing
1924.5,4.799,to do so we've been working on what we
1927.38,4.26,call Meta algorithms algorithms that
1929.299,4.081,take other algorithms as input run those
1931.64,5.1,other algorithms many times essentially
1933.38,4.62,do a statistical experiment design on
1936.74,4.02,these algorithms figure out kind of
1938.0,4.5,what's going on with them and uh and
1940.76,3.12,explore the space and eventually find
1942.5,3.659,some parameter configuration that works
1943.88,3.659,really well you might be skeptical that
1946.159,3.721,such a thing could be make made
1947.539,3.601,practical it's it's beyond the scope of
1949.88,3.779,this talk to say much about how that
1951.14,4.259,works so I'll say one thing but suffice
1953.659,3.12,it to say that this really does work
1955.399,2.101,pretty well
1956.779,3.721,um
1957.5,5.399,so kind of intuitively how do we do it
1960.5,4.14,um Let me give the example of a single
1962.899,3.481,parameter which is small enough that I
1964.64,3.48,can draw it on the board here so so
1966.38,3.36,let's say I have a parameter X which
1968.12,3.84,affects the performance of my algorithm
1969.74,4.319,and I have a parameter y that I want to
1971.96,4.26,minimize think of why as something like
1974.059,4.441,the log of runtime so I'm trying to make
1976.22,4.5,an algorithm that that whose runtime is
1978.5,3.48,minimized on the same instances so I'm
1980.72,2.939,running this over and over again on the
1981.98,4.14,same problems
1983.659,4.5,um so let's let's imagine that this red
1986.12,3.299,line in the graph here is the true
1988.159,3.181,performance of the algorithm as a
1989.419,3.781,function of x
1991.34,3.179,um and of course I don't know that if I
1993.2,3.719,knew that I would just minimize that but
1994.519,3.9,I don't get to ever observe that what I
1996.919,3.421,get to do is run the algorithm at
1998.419,4.86,particular points and observe its run
2000.34,5.28,time at that point so these blue circles
2003.279,4.38,are places where I actually observed the
2005.62,4.5,runtime of the algorithm
2007.659,5.221,um then what I do is I fit a a
2010.12,4.62,regression model to all of this I use a
2012.88,3.36,fancy kind of non-parametric regression
2014.74,3.96,in this case I'm using something called
2016.24,4.14,gaussian process regression the
2018.7,3.959,advantage of gaussian processes is they
2020.38,3.539,give me uncertainty estimates well
2022.659,2.88,they're non-parametric so they're
2023.919,3.12,arbitrarily Wiggly which is important to
2025.539,3.36,me and they give me uncertainty
2027.039,3.901,estimates which are small at points that
2028.899,3.961,I've observed because I I know what's
2030.94,3.42,going on there and they get bigger as I
2032.86,4.919,get away from points that I observe so
2034.36,5.699,so these um these gray ellipses are the
2037.779,4.081,uncertainty estimates at every point and
2040.059,2.941,so what you'll see is you know right at
2041.86,2.88,the Blue Points the uncertainty
2043.0,6.06,estimates are small and as they get away
2044.74,6.359,they're big and then what I do is I try
2049.06,4.68,to find a point that looks like would be
2051.099,4.441,good to evaluate a point that I haven't
2053.74,3.0,seen yet that looks like it might be
2055.54,3.359,better than anything that I've seen
2056.74,3.32,before and what would it take to maybe
2058.899,4.381,be better
2060.06,4.9,you want to both be pretty low on the
2063.28,4.44,line and also have pretty high
2064.96,4.439,uncertainty and so so that Criterion is
2067.72,3.48,called expected Improvement what's the
2069.399,3.72,what's the amount of improvement that I
2071.2,4.56,could gain conditional on being better
2073.119,4.381,than the point that I've got now
2075.76,3.359,um so the green line that I'm showing
2077.5,3.659,you is a scaled version of expected
2079.119,4.621,Improvement on this line and you can see
2081.159,4.44,a good place to evaluate would be right
2083.74,5.399,here according to the line
2085.599,4.861,and because I have high uncertainty at
2089.139,3.78,that point because these two points are
2090.46,3.899,pretty far apart and also the line is
2092.919,2.76,pretty small so here's a point that kind
2094.359,2.76,of makes a good trade-off between the
2095.679,3.241,height of the line and the amount of
2097.119,4.321,uncertainty so I would then do another
2098.92,4.32,experiment right there and I would learn
2101.44,3.659,that in fact it's not as good as the as
2103.24,3.72,the point to its left but then I would
2105.099,4.201,update my uncertainty estimates that I'd
2106.96,4.2,have another point and then I would end
2109.3,4.14,up my second choice would be to go here
2111.16,3.419,which really is a minimum or close to a
2113.44,3.179,minimum and I learned something good and
2114.579,4.741,I kind of keep going so so that's how
2116.619,4.561,this sort of uh search Guided by a
2119.32,4.56,learned model in real time kind of can
2121.18,4.32,work so so this is uh this thing we have
2123.88,4.56,called sequential model based algorithm
2125.5,4.14,configuration or smack that's how it
2128.44,4.5,works
2129.64,5.34,okay so so that that's that's the idea
2132.94,3.54,of algorithm configuration and then I
2134.98,3.54,have the idea of making an algorithm
2136.48,4.02,portfolio which essentially says
2138.52,3.839,different solvers have different areas
2140.5,3.119,of strength and weakness so why should I
2142.359,3.361,have to commit just like a financial
2143.619,3.841,portfolio why should I buy only one
2145.72,4.8,stock why should I have only one
2147.46,5.159,algorithm in my back pocket why not have
2150.52,4.559,access to many uncorrelated algorithms
2152.619,4.441,and thereby leverage the fact that that
2155.079,3.241,the men of the the average of men's is
2157.06,2.46,different than the the men of the
2158.32,1.92,average
2159.52,3.42,um
2160.24,3.9,so uh so basically we leveraged this
2162.94,3.48,idea too we built something called
2164.14,3.78,sadzilla which is a portfolio of sat
2166.42,3.78,solvers this is a pictorial
2167.92,3.84,representation of what it does
2170.2,3.68,um and uh
2171.76,5.76,it's destroying Tokyo in this picture
2173.88,5.38,and uh basically this has become just
2177.52,4.86,kind of a dominantly successful strategy
2179.26,5.64,in the sap Community whatever that is
2182.38,6.6,um so so basically we took all of these
2184.9,6.06,things together and and we built a uh a
2188.98,3.48,SAT solver for the fcc's problem so so
2190.96,2.94,I'm going to kind of conclude here by
2192.46,5.28,showing you experimentally what did this
2193.9,5.939,do on the fcc's problem and uh here's uh
2197.74,4.68,so I need to show you uh how this graph
2199.839,4.201,works so this is uh the run time so
2202.42,3.24,basically I'm given some some
2204.04,3.96,distribution of instances that that
2205.66,5.16,arose in simulations of the auction that
2208.0,4.859,really you know to our best knowledge
2210.82,4.14,reflect what might happen in the fcc's
2212.859,3.98,auction and I've got
2214.96,4.26,um problems of up to
2216.839,4.24,1133 stations
2219.22,4.2,um which means tens of thousands of
2221.079,4.561,variables in the Statin coding on the
2223.42,4.199,full USA interference graph
2225.64,3.9,um so I take those problems and then I
2227.619,3.601,run various sat solvers on them so in
2229.54,3.299,the upper left-hand Corner these are the
2231.22,4.02,names of different and sat solvers that
2232.839,4.26,I ran and I'm showing you a cumulative
2235.24,3.78,density function here which says the
2237.099,3.781,probability of the basically the
2239.02,4.26,fraction of instances that got solved
2240.88,4.32,within every amount of time so looking
2243.28,5.1,for example at this blue line which is a
2245.2,5.04,solver called clasp you know after uh 10
2248.38,4.26,to the zero seconds after one second and
2250.24,4.02,it solved nothing after about two
2252.64,5.4,seconds it was starting to solve things
2254.26,5.16,after 10 seconds it solved a little bit
2258.04,4.02,more than 10 percent of the instances
2259.42,3.96,and and so on and then we ran it for
2262.06,2.82,five minutes we ran everything for five
2263.38,3.36,minutes so after five minutes we just
2264.88,3.42,stopped them because you know we're not
2266.74,4.44,made of time here we have to stop it at
2268.3,5.16,some point and uh and you see that the
2271.18,5.04,best of the solvers got maybe 45 percent
2273.46,4.56,of the instances solved which is already
2276.22,3.359,kind of good I mean something I should
2278.02,3.0,point out is that if you don't solve
2279.579,2.821,something you can just call it
2281.02,3.3,impossible you can just freeze that
2282.4,3.6,station and that basically costs you
2284.32,3.12,money but but that's okay right there's
2286.0,2.579,nothing that goes wrong from an
2287.44,3.0,incentive point of view if somebody gets
2288.579,3.901,frozen early you just pay them too much
2290.44,3.36,and as a computer scientist there's
2292.48,4.26,something really beautiful about that
2293.8,4.559,because there's a trade-off between how
2296.74,3.42,well you can solve the problem and how
2298.359,3.841,much you have to pay people so you can
2300.16,4.679,really go to the FCC and say if I can
2302.2,4.32,give you one percent you know better sat
2304.839,4.321,solving ability I'm going to save you
2306.52,4.2,100 million dollars and you know
2309.16,2.939,normally in the sac Community you don't
2310.72,3.02,get to say things like that so that's
2312.099,4.381,pretty cool
2313.74,4.42,normally you can say if I can you know
2316.48,4.379,do one percent better I can write a
2318.16,4.26,paper in the South Community okay so so
2320.859,5.101,basically we added a specially
2322.42,4.98,configured version of clasp uh we built
2325.96,2.94,a specially configured version of clasp
2327.4,3.42,why do we pick class which looks like
2328.9,4.14,the worst thing here basically because
2330.82,4.5,it was designed by its authors to expose
2333.04,3.42,a lot of parameters so it was designed
2335.32,3.18,to work really well with this
2336.46,4.26,configuration kind of approach and so
2338.5,4.079,it's really suited to this
2340.72,4.08,um and and we built something that
2342.579,4.5,worked dramatically better
2344.8,3.779,um so this is now solving about 75
2347.079,3.721,percent of the instances within five
2348.579,4.921,minutes and so that's already looking
2350.8,4.319,pretty good we then
2353.5,3.119,um basically did both a bunch of
2355.119,3.661,engineering and added some kind of
2356.619,4.441,portfolio ideas to this and built
2358.78,4.38,something that we call sat FC which for
2361.06,4.26,feasibility checking which is this red
2363.16,4.919,line and this is the thing that that
2365.32,5.1,we've made available to the FCC
2368.079,4.081,um and and you can see this is
2370.42,4.38,stochastically dominating everything
2372.16,4.32,else by by pretty healthy down partly
2374.8,3.18,just by by dealing with very easy
2376.48,3.359,instances very quickly there are a lot
2377.98,3.84,of very easy instances
2379.839,4.74,um but we're now solving
2381.82,4.799,um just about everything all but about
2384.579,3.78,two percent of the instances uh within
2386.619,3.541,an eight hour cutoff
2388.359,3.061,um and so so this already gives you some
2390.16,3.3,sense that there's there's only so much
2391.42,3.54,to be gained by parallelization here
2393.46,3.78,there are only 2 000 stations that need
2394.96,3.84,to be checked around
2397.24,3.119,um so what does this look like most of
2398.8,2.88,the problems were satisfiable the blue
2400.359,3.24,bars here are points where it was
2401.68,3.72,satisfiable the red bars are points
2403.599,3.061,where it was unsat the gray bars are
2405.4,2.88,points where we timed down and didn't
2406.66,4.38,know and you can see we timed out in
2408.28,4.799,about one percent of the instances
2411.04,3.24,um so this is the last slide that I'll
2413.079,3.121,give you
2414.28,4.44,um so far I've talked about a situation
2416.2,5.34,where we have people either going off
2418.72,4.619,the air or staying on the air in
2421.54,3.78,practice those of you who are old enough
2423.339,4.5,to remember televisions as compared to
2425.32,4.94,computers and particularly televisions
2427.839,4.621,that you actually accessed on the air
2430.26,4.359,might be aware of the fact that there's
2432.46,4.02,something called UHF and VHF there are
2434.619,4.381,different kinds of Television spectrum
2436.48,4.92,and you might remember that VHF is kind
2439.0,3.839,of bad relative to UHF right it's sort
2441.4,4.8,of a grainier picture it's not quite as
2442.839,5.581,good and so it is now we really have
2446.2,4.02,both of those kinds of spectrum UHF is
2448.42,3.24,the stuff that we actually want to sell
2450.22,3.72,to the telecoms that's more appropriate
2451.66,3.959,for them so one thing that we might be
2453.94,3.84,able to do is say
2455.619,3.601,um the UHF stations could instead of
2457.78,3.54,going off the air maybe we should pay
2459.22,4.139,them a lower amount to accept a lower
2461.32,5.22,quality good to accept VHF Spectrum
2463.359,4.861,instead of UHF spectrum and uh and and
2466.54,3.36,then you know that's another way of
2468.22,3.379,freeing up UHF Spectrum so maybe we
2469.9,4.199,should give them these multiple options
2471.599,3.941,this is tricky and you know then of
2474.099,3.721,course I can do cascading things like I
2475.54,4.74,can buy out a VHF station thereby making
2477.82,4.14,some VHF Spectrum available and then I
2480.28,3.42,can get a UHF guy to move into that and
2481.96,3.6,if those two moves are cheaper than
2483.7,4.379,getting that one guy to go off air maybe
2485.56,5.279,that's a better thing to do so so we
2488.079,4.5,what we and in fact there's not just VHF
2490.839,3.301,but there's upper VHF and lower VHF
2492.579,3.121,which are themselves different so
2494.14,3.06,there's really three bands of spectrum
2495.7,2.1,to care about
2497.2,3.419,um
2497.8,5.22,so it the problem is doing a design on
2500.619,4.561,this kind of space involves multi-minded
2503.02,3.96,bidders it involves bidders who have
2505.18,5.04,values for now multiple things rather
2506.98,4.5,than just going off air and and that
2510.22,3.54,makes the auction design much more
2511.48,4.26,complex because as all of us know here
2513.76,4.5,auction design for multi-minded bidders
2515.74,4.08,is is much uh more difficult to think
2518.26,3.54,about than for single-minded bidders
2519.82,4.98,except in this kind of Glorious Point
2521.8,5.039,case of vcg so
2524.8,3.42,um so this has been an area of active
2526.839,4.081,study for the the groups working with
2528.22,4.2,the FCC right now there are a whole
2530.92,2.699,variety of different proposals on the
2532.42,3.3,table
2533.619,4.021,um I I'm happy to kind of talk to you
2535.72,3.48,about some of the ideas here I've in the
2537.64,4.68,end ended up proposing something which
2539.2,4.08,I'm kind of excited about but I'm out of
2542.32,2.759,time now so I'm not going to tell you
2543.28,2.78,now what that is
2545.079,2.581,um
2546.06,4.72,instead
2547.66,4.32,I will just conclude if my computer
2550.78,3.96,worked the way I thought it did I'll
2551.98,5.28,just conclude here so uh so there we go
2554.74,4.56,so I guess I've told you about uh the
2557.26,4.26,way the FCC incentive action works if
2559.3,3.42,you're interested uh let me say sort of
2561.52,2.339,one sentence about what these other
2562.72,3.3,things are and I'm happy to talk with
2563.859,4.861,you about them on the coffee break
2566.02,4.44,um so one of them is this idea of what I
2568.72,4.2,call computational mechanism analysis
2570.46,4.74,which basically means using computers to
2572.92,4.439,analyze existing mechanisms by solving
2575.2,4.08,exactly for their equilibria on samples
2577.359,3.72,from evaluation distribution of Interest
2579.28,4.68,so we can think about something like
2581.079,5.101,sponsored search auctions and ask
2583.96,4.26,um you know how efficient is some given
2586.18,4.38,mechanism or how much revenue would it
2588.22,4.139,give me on expectation given different
2590.56,3.6,settings of a reserve price parameter or
2592.359,3.841,something like that so that's what I
2594.16,3.72,call computational mechanism analysis it
2596.2,3.659,basically works on the fact that that
2597.88,4.08,they're now as of maybe five years ago
2599.859,4.681,exists some really powerful techniques
2601.96,4.44,for finding the exact equilibria of
2604.54,2.88,compactly represented games so that
2606.4,2.34,might be a technology that would be
2607.42,3.48,interested think to some of you so I
2608.74,4.68,just want to throw that out there the
2610.9,4.62,last thing is about a kind of sabbatical
2613.42,4.32,project that I worked on in Uganda for
2615.52,4.62,building a cell phone based mobile
2617.74,4.56,market for agricultural Commodities
2620.14,5.54,allowing subsistence Farmers to sell
2622.3,5.58,Surplus produce to traders in the cities
2625.68,4.84,using a kind of Craigslist that runs
2627.88,4.26,over SMS which is effectively a kind of
2630.52,4.62,double auction so if you're curious
2632.14,4.62,about the application of economic theory
2635.14,3.66,to development problems I'm happy to
2636.76,3.599,talk about that too so thanks for your
2638.8,4.4,attention and let's all have lunch
2640.359,2.841,cheers
