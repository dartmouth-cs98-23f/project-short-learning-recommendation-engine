second,duration,transcript
1.36,4.32,hey everyone good morning it's frost
3.12,5.2,here and welcome speakeasy js
5.68,3.52,the meetup for mad science hacking and
8.32,3.52,experiments
9.2,4.08,uh i'll be your host this morning so
11.84,3.44,glad you're joining us today
13.28,3.44,um that science is all about building
15.28,3.12,things that make people say i didn't
16.72,5.04,know that was possible
18.4,4.48,uh so today we're joined by nick uh i'm
21.76,1.84,gonna probably get your name last name
22.88,3.44,wrong sorry
23.6,3.919,doron uh is that right yes that's okay
26.32,5.199,amazing
27.519,7.04,great uh nice to have you here
31.519,3.441,yeah thanks for having me for us yeah of
34.559,3.361,course
34.96,4.64,so um so again i'm super excited that uh
37.92,4.319,nick is joining us today because
39.6,4.16,uh he is a full stack engineer and a
42.239,3.361,digital nomad
43.76,3.92,and he's been living out of airbnb since
45.6,5.2,2014 i just learned
47.68,5.6,and i think that is just wow that is
50.8,3.759,pretty cool yeah it's been great to
53.28,4.24,travel all over
54.559,3.441,and do you know when we're in tech we're
57.52,2.48,really lucky
58.0,3.12,we get to travel and work from different
60.0,4.159,places
61.12,5.6,um so it's been really good yeah
64.159,4.241,yeah that's super cool i um i i kind of
66.72,2.56,uh think well we've all been maybe some
68.4,2.48,of us have been doing some more
69.28,4.8,traveling than normal um
70.88,5.52,during uh during the pandemic um
74.08,4.32,but um yeah anyway that's super cool
76.4,4.399,super interesting fact about you
78.4,4.079,uh and yeah so uh we're gonna learn all
80.799,4.081,about quantum computing which i have to
82.479,2.881,say i know nothing about um so i'm i'm
84.88,2.0,super
85.36,3.119,excited to learn about that a bit and
86.88,2.72,then also how it combines with
88.479,3.361,javascript
89.6,3.12,yeah well yeah it's a great place to get
91.84,1.76,started with like
92.72,2.399,even if you don't know a lot about
93.6,2.24,quantum computing i'm not a quantum
95.119,3.841,physicist
95.84,4.56,i did not uh do like a computer science
98.96,3.119,degree in this or anything like that but
100.4,2.56,just coming into this as a web developer
102.079,2.961,and saying
102.96,3.439,what can i understand about this and
105.04,4.24,what can i do
106.399,3.601,in this very rapidly evolving and
109.28,3.76,changing
110.0,4.64,space of quantum computing
113.04,3.84,well great i can't wait to hear it so uh
114.64,5.68,yeah feel free to get started
116.88,5.68,yeah um cool so uh
120.32,3.28,title ready or not quantum computers and
122.56,3.839,js
123.6,3.6,a little bit about me and my day job uh
126.399,3.521,not to
127.2,4.399,ruin the mood with u.s politics but i
129.92,4.56,work in a redistricting
131.599,4.161,and anti-gerrymandering program uh for
134.48,3.119,people not outside the us we just
135.76,4.8,completed the u.s census
137.599,5.441,last year so all of the congressional
140.56,5.6,and city council districts are redrawn
143.04,5.279,to balance the amount of people in each
146.16,3.84,district i also some side projects in
148.319,4.161,natural language processing
150.0,3.48,and my kind of top hacker news link that
152.48,3.839,i've ever had is
153.48,4.36,fortran.io but we're going to talk about
156.319,3.841,quantum computers today
157.84,4.56,and my connection to quantum computers
160.16,4.48,definitely was entirely a side project
162.4,4.0,yet it's one of my side projects is the
164.64,3.76,most legs in terms of
166.4,3.76,it's the one thing i mentioned for in a
168.4,4.96,citation on wikipedia
170.16,4.24,and it got me into a conference at the
173.36,4.159,international
174.4,6.64,atomic energy agency in vienna uh
177.519,4.961,so that is such a bizarre
181.04,3.68,space and there's a lot of different
182.48,4.08,people working on this problem
184.72,3.599,that it's great to interact with them
186.56,3.28,during this
188.319,3.361,so quantum computing has been getting a
189.84,4.479,lot of interest a lot of hype
191.68,3.36,uh recently uh these are some headlines
194.319,2.481,that
195.04,3.119,i've grabbed over some time you know
196.8,4.079,google getting
198.159,3.921,um quantum supremacy so-called squadron
200.879,4.401,supremacy
202.08,5.04,and uh amazon also
205.28,3.92,for launching quantum computing service
207.12,5.36,china europe and the us each
209.2,6.319,investing over a billion dollars
212.48,5.28,in research into quantum specifically
215.519,4.08,so what are what makes people really
217.76,4.88,excited about quantum computing
219.599,4.801,so if you're familiar with moore's law
222.64,3.36,uh the idea is that over time our
224.4,3.759,computers are getting smaller
226.0,4.08,and better and cheaper all at the same
228.159,3.201,time that's how computing is moving so
230.08,3.76,rapidly
231.36,3.76,so you know the first generation was you
233.84,5.119,know the
235.12,6.479,like weaving looms and then vacuum tubes
238.959,3.761,and then transistors which we now use in
241.599,4.481,all these different chips
242.72,6.0,but now uh people who are researching in
246.08,3.84,transistors have made transistors that
248.72,3.76,are the size of
249.92,3.36,just a few atoms and that's the
252.48,3.36,theoretically
253.28,4.639,physically smallest that you can make a
255.84,4.079,transistor so we're hitting kind of a
257.919,4.241,wall there where people are wondering
259.919,4.081,what happens next how can more
262.16,3.2,law be continued and there are a lot of
264.0,4.08,different theories out there with
265.36,5.68,photons lasers
268.08,5.04,doing different three-dimensional things
271.04,4.879,but as you will recall the
273.12,4.48,topic of this talk is quantum computing
275.919,3.761,so i'm just going to focus on this idea
277.6,4.48,which is that quantum computing
279.68,4.0,could for particular applications be
282.08,4.559,much more powerful
283.68,4.239,and faster than classical computing with
286.639,3.361,transistors
287.919,3.761,and be an entirely new generation of
290.0,4.84,computer compared to
291.68,4.4,that same change from vacuum tube to
294.84,3.0,transistor
296.08,3.44,and the applications is useful for it
297.84,3.919,you probably wouldn't you know need to
299.52,4.959,run a web browser in a quantum computer
301.759,3.521,but it can be useful for particular
304.479,3.601,tasks
305.28,4.639,which even at a small scale would have a
308.08,3.92,great commercial application so these
309.919,5.441,are the top three
312.0,4.8,uh areas where i see the most interest
315.36,4.08,in quantum computing
316.8,4.88,one being simulating quantum chemistry
319.44,5.039,if you think about it
321.68,4.56,rather than simulating these molecules
324.479,4.321,and forces and things like that
326.24,4.399,inside of a classical computer and
328.8,4.08,dealing with all those possible
330.639,3.441,options and interactions it might be
332.88,4.319,more helpful to have
334.08,6.72,a computer have
337.199,4.881,quantum molecules inside of it
340.8,3.6,where those are interacting in a
342.08,4.0,particular way and doing computations in
344.4,4.48,a particular way
346.08,4.8,that is more native to that actual
348.88,4.4,problem space
350.88,3.84,the second one that i see i mean you
353.28,2.24,know whenever you see a few different
354.72,4.0,words together
355.52,4.88,like quantum blockchain ml together you
358.72,3.44,think this is just all hype
360.4,4.639,i don't want to listen to it but there
362.16,5.52,is an actual interest in eventually
365.039,5.121,doing some type of machine learning in
367.68,7.28,quantum computing because
370.16,8.479,it can be applied over a very large
374.96,5.2,function and so potentially be easier
378.639,3.12,it'll be easier for it to find the
380.16,3.759,absolute minima
381.759,3.921,and or absolute maxima depending on how
383.919,4.081,you're creating your function
385.68,4.88,and that would make it easier to use
388.0,6.08,these quantum devices to train
390.56,5.759,uh on this machine learning problem
394.08,3.92,i think the most famous one though which
396.319,2.561,um i don't know if people have heard
398.0,2.08,about this before
398.88,2.72,through in association with quantum
400.08,2.88,computing but seems to be the most
401.6,4.4,famous one
402.96,3.6,is that quantum computers can be used to
406.0,3.68,find
406.56,6.88,the prime factors of a number
409.68,3.76,much faster than
414.24,4.079,than classical computers where in
416.24,5.28,classical computers it's seen as a
418.319,3.681,exponentially difficult problem in the
421.52,3.36,quantum
422.0,3.68,computer it is a linearly difficult
424.88,4.4,problem
425.68,5.359,so problems which number uh
429.28,3.039,encryption which you can safely say will
431.039,5.28,not be cracked
432.319,6.0,with a classical computer um will
436.319,3.28,actually be somewhat easier to do in a
438.319,2.641,quantum computer
439.599,3.761,once we have a quantum computer that's
440.96,3.6,the right size we don't know when that's
443.36,3.679,going to be
444.56,3.68,probably in the distant future but it's
447.039,2.641,something that
448.24,3.519,you know we have to talk about because
449.68,2.639,it's it would be a huge deal if i don't
451.759,2.401,know
452.319,3.201,how people how familiar people are in
454.16,2.96,the audience with different kinds of
455.52,5.519,encryption algorithms
457.12,7.44,but aes ecc rsa these are all based
461.039,6.081,on uh
464.56,3.359,factoring prime numbers like both each
467.12,1.919,side has
467.919,2.241,the knowledge of the prime number so
469.039,1.921,they're able to communicate to each
470.16,2.719,other
470.96,3.519,but someone who's intercepting is not
472.879,3.201,able to factor it out
474.479,4.16,well in this case if you have the
476.08,3.76,quantum computer or if you're collecting
478.639,2.56,data now this is something people are
479.84,2.479,also concerned about
481.199,2.641,if you know you're going to have a
482.319,2.961,quantum computer in the future you might
483.84,4.32,be collecting data now
485.28,3.359,to decrypt later on the quantum computer
488.16,2.56,so
488.639,5.28,there's a real fear that problems that
490.72,5.199,we've relied on being complicated
493.919,3.441,will become easier once a large enough
495.919,4.0,quantum computer is
497.36,3.6,built and i should clarify this is not
499.919,3.761,the same thing as p
500.96,4.239,equals np those problems are not useful
503.68,2.88,for encryption because they're very
505.199,4.4,difficult to
506.56,4.72,for both sides to compute and the
509.599,3.521,quantum computer does not make that any
511.28,3.52,better this is just specific problems
513.12,3.68,that people have already
514.8,4.64,studied and come up with quantum
516.8,4.159,circuits that can help them solve it
519.44,3.44,so people have known about this for a
520.959,3.44,long time shore's algorithm which is
522.88,4.88,what this is based on
524.399,6.481,mostly was published in 1994
527.76,5.6,and uh the tom clancy novel night moves
530.88,4.0,in 1999 had a quantum computer as one of
533.36,5.2,the key
534.88,4.639,um key issue key plot points or
538.56,3.04,something like that
539.519,3.841,uh it's been a while since i looked at
541.6,2.88,it um
543.36,2.24,so people have known about this for a
544.48,2.56,while and said you know what there are
545.6,4.16,no quantum computers here
547.04,3.68,we don't have to think about it but the
549.76,2.48,time is getting
550.72,3.92,closer you know now there are actual
552.24,4.32,multiple startups major companies like
554.64,4.08,microsoft and google with
556.56,3.6,research teams we'll talk about how many
558.72,2.119,qubits they have now because that's a
560.16,3.6,little bit
560.839,4.601,controversial but now that people are
563.76,3.04,saying okay we have run a quantum
565.44,3.839,computing
566.8,4.0,problem maybe we should take this a
569.279,3.921,little bit more seriously
570.8,4.479,so some examples of how people are
573.2,4.96,responding to this
575.279,5.361,is in google chrome they have just
578.16,5.92,randomly selected some users
580.64,6.879,to encrypt their data with um
584.08,7.12,both the current like uh
587.519,4.401,aes encryption and a new kind of
591.2,4.24,encryption
591.92,6.16,called lattice-based encryption
595.44,4.0,which is believed to be post quantum
598.08,4.16,effective
599.44,3.92,uh microsoft has been advising companies
602.24,3.76,that have
603.36,4.88,their profits far off into the future
606.0,4.56,for example pharmaceutical corporations
608.24,5.36,there's so many let's say like even what
610.56,5.92,10 20 years of development into a drug
613.6,3.84,that you don't want those emails to be
616.48,2.72,decrypted
617.44,3.839,to be collected now and then decrypted
619.2,3.92,and used for some kind of espionage
621.279,4.56,in the distant future so microsoft
623.12,4.0,started advising particular industries
625.839,3.761,that they should look into this
627.12,5.04,post-quantum encryption already
629.6,3.679,and uh the national standards
632.16,4.08,organization for the us
633.279,4.8,nist is running a competition right now
636.24,5.279,where there's different competing
638.079,4.801,standards for post-quantum encryption
641.519,2.56,that they're evaluating and letting
642.88,2.72,other people look at
644.079,3.041,and this is a very tricky space because
645.6,2.799,one we don't have a lot of quantum
647.12,2.88,computers to test against
648.399,3.12,we don't a lot of quantum computing
650.0,3.68,experts to
651.519,3.281,look over the algorithms and you know
653.68,4.32,challenge
654.8,5.2,these different proposals and
658.0,4.079,also you can't just develop something
660.0,4.079,that's useful against quantum computers
662.079,3.521,it has to be useful against quantum and
664.079,2.721,classical computers
665.6,3.04,because you don't want to start
666.8,4.0,encrypting everyone's data for these
668.64,6.16,theoretical quantum stuff in the future
670.8,5.68,and in the process expose people's data
674.8,3.36,because you used a brand new algorithm
676.48,3.28,that hasn't been fully vetted
678.16,3.6,so they're trying to find the right way
679.76,3.28,to experiment with it and not have like
681.76,5.44,a performance loss
683.04,7.6,or build systems that will become
687.2,5.199,outdated and vulnerable in the future
690.64,2.8,so the problem one which i think we
692.399,2.0,talked about a little bit in the
693.44,3.12,beginning
694.399,3.521,is richard feynman famous physicist said
696.56,3.76,i think i can safely say
697.92,3.68,nobody understands quantum mechanics
700.32,3.519,which is to say that
701.6,3.76,there isn't you know like a little toy
703.839,2.801,kit like you can get a kit that gives
705.36,3.2,you like little circuits and kind of
706.64,3.759,learn a little bit about oh
708.56,3.519,electricity goes in the circuit and you
710.399,3.281,play around with it there isn't like a
712.079,3.2,physical analog
713.68,3.36,that you can play around with with your
715.279,4.961,hands that covers
717.04,5.599,the intricacies of quantum mechanics
720.24,4.64,quantum chemistry things like this i
722.639,3.76,don't really expect as a programmer that
724.88,2.88,i'm going to understand it in the same
726.399,2.88,way that
727.76,3.84,you know if i were on a desert island
729.279,3.12,with a chip fab i wouldn't be able to
731.6,3.12,say okay
732.399,3.841,i'm gonna learn how to put together
734.72,2.4,transistors and learn how to put
736.24,2.399,together
737.12,3.519,chips and learn how to put together a
738.639,3.361,cpu and learn how to make it start
740.639,4.081,running javascript
742.0,4.0,because there's so many steps in between
744.72,4.799,that
746.0,5.68,physical level and the
749.519,3.281,application if i'm just a developer on
751.68,2.56,the end point
752.8,3.76,maybe i just need to know what are the
754.24,4.08,useful applications and
756.56,5.279,what is really going on in there like
758.32,3.519,how people are programming it today
762.0,4.0,um so the one thing i would say that
764.639,2.64,would be a good thing to look into
766.0,2.959,if you're trying to understand this
767.279,3.041,space is there's something called the
768.959,2.401,block sphere which is how people
770.32,4.079,represent
771.36,5.279,each qubit so in classical computing
774.399,3.281,you have bits that add up to a byte and
776.639,4.401,so on
777.68,7.52,in the quantum computing
781.04,6.16,you have qubits and sort of the popular
785.2,4.24,news story thing to say is that they're
787.2,4.319,both zero and one and they could be
789.44,3.519,both zero and one that makes you wonder
791.519,2.721,like what's the usefulness of something
792.959,2.401,that you don't know
794.24,3.039,if it's zero or one what's the
795.36,3.36,usefulness of that so
797.279,3.841,what was really helpful to me to read
798.72,5.04,more about this is that
801.12,3.92,there's uh they're not really zero or
803.76,4.16,one randomly
805.04,3.52,there is a probability space that these
807.92,2.479,are in
808.56,4.16,so you could draw it as a function you
810.399,5.521,can draw it as this kind of sphere
812.72,4.88,and that's the probability that
815.92,3.44,what so it's in this quantum state right
817.6,3.919,now and
819.36,3.279,if something that is not in
821.519,3.361,superposition
822.639,4.481,okay so it's in superposition right now
824.88,5.28,if something is not in superposition
827.12,6.079,hits it then it will resolve into
830.16,4.96,a zero or a one so typically what's that
833.199,3.601,is that's done with um shooting them
835.12,3.6,with a laser pretty cool
836.8,4.479,and then it'll resolve to zero or one
838.72,4.799,and then if you run multiple experiments
841.279,3.041,you'll say okay ten percent of the time
843.519,2.481,it was zero
844.32,3.759,ninety percent of the time it was one
846.0,4.72,and you can use that to represent
848.079,4.56,what was its probability state at that
850.72,5.44,point of the program
852.639,4.801,um so not fully easy to understand
856.16,3.119,but this was the part where i understood
857.44,4.0,okay it's not just like a random number
859.279,5.041,that we're trying to get value out of
861.44,4.48,in fact there's a one thing i read that
864.32,4.319,compared it to more like
865.92,4.719,analog like pre-digital computing
868.639,5.601,because it has a value
870.639,4.88,that is not neither zero nor one but
874.24,3.839,more of like a probability
875.519,3.44,function or wave and that wave can be
878.079,4.56,shifted
878.959,6.161,that wave can be modified and then
882.639,4.0,when you have multiple qubits that are
885.12,4.0,in superposition
886.639,4.961,you can entangle them in some way so
889.12,4.079,that if this could be
891.6,3.679,a few different options and this can be
893.199,2.561,a few different options you can cross
895.279,3.761,them
895.76,5.84,or entangle them and now you have
899.04,4.159,you know multiple interactions happening
901.6,3.679,in that
903.199,3.601,probability space and then you you know
905.279,3.201,you run the program multiple times you
906.8,3.039,shoot the laser to measure it
908.48,3.76,and then you come up with a
909.839,5.921,representation of what was the final
912.24,6.56,probability um yeah problem two
915.76,3.68,uh the hardware uh to run this if you
918.8,1.92,imagine that
919.44,3.12,if anything hits something that's in
920.72,3.119,superposition it's gonna drop out of
922.56,4.56,superposition
923.839,4.881,you can't have this be in open air
927.12,3.04,so something like this that you might
928.72,3.359,see a picture in the news
930.16,3.84,they put it inside of a vacuum they cool
932.079,3.601,it down to absolute zero
934.0,3.36,so the molecules aren't moving around
935.68,2.24,like that they sometimes use lasers to
937.36,2.64,shoot them
937.92,4.08,into not moving around so much called
940.0,4.72,something called laser cooling
942.0,4.8,um so long story short you're not gonna
944.72,4.4,have a quantum computer on your desk
946.8,4.24,like if you have a lab where you might
949.12,4.0,have a absolute zero freezer
951.04,3.76,maybe it's possible but these are always
953.12,3.04,going to be or for the near
954.8,3.599,for the foreseeable future they're going
956.16,4.96,to be extremely complex
958.399,4.321,devices that are used kind of as in a
961.12,4.079,cloud computing center
962.72,3.039,and you interact with them over the web
965.199,3.841,uh
965.759,4.88,i should uh yeah okay um so how many
969.04,3.12,qubits uh right now
970.639,3.2,if you look at wikipedia they're saying
972.16,4.96,the top one is 76
973.839,6.56,quantum computing or superconducting
977.12,5.76,qubits uh so when that number gets up
980.399,3.921,into the thousands then and they're all
982.88,3.04,entangled with each other
984.32,4.4,then there'd be an encryption issue so
985.92,4.64,that's why it still feels very far away
988.72,3.52,um and you can also see these are from
990.56,3.76,2018 2020
992.24,3.76,these numbers are not going up
994.32,4.72,exponentially right now it's very
996.0,4.16,difficult to figure out how to build
999.04,3.44,these
1000.16,4.16,how to make them work reliably and then
1002.48,3.12,also you actually have to physically
1004.32,3.28,design the chip
1005.6,3.76,so that they can connect with each other
1007.6,4.08,so there's like a topology
1009.36,3.44,of building the gates in between each
1011.68,3.599,qubit
1012.8,4.159,in the chip i'll also say that there's a
1015.279,3.12,company called d-wave
1016.959,4.161,which will say that they have hundreds
1018.399,5.841,of qubits and they do but
1021.12,4.959,those are a different kind of qubit
1024.24,3.839,through quantum annealing so you can't
1026.079,3.6,compare different hardwares to each
1028.079,3.681,other
1029.679,4.081,based on that number so they're useful
1031.76,4.159,for other applications but it's not
1033.76,5.279,it's not the same number that they're
1035.919,5.441,comparing apples to oranges in that case
1039.039,3.601,um so like i talked about earlier you
1041.36,4.0,program bits by
1042.64,3.52,connecting these bits together with
1045.36,3.92,gates
1046.16,4.48,and coming up with some kind of
1049.28,3.36,processing out of that and then
1050.64,3.68,eventually you have assembly compilers
1052.64,4.64,and then javascript
1054.32,4.479,in the quantum world you have the qubits
1057.28,4.08,they're connected by these
1058.799,4.161,quantum gates uh right now a lot of
1061.36,3.12,development like i said is going into
1062.96,4.8,the hardware
1064.48,5.68,and topology of the chip then even if
1067.76,5.12,you have multiple qubits
1070.16,4.48,uh those are like the physical qubits in
1072.88,3.28,the sense
1074.64,3.36,there's a problem which is there's a lot
1076.16,4.08,of noise and there could be errors
1078.0,4.32,in digital computing we know how to do
1080.24,4.88,error correction in like connections
1082.32,3.44,in quantum computing you can't do error
1085.12,4.0,correction
1085.76,6.4,against uh something as out of
1089.12,6.24,against um a classical bit because
1092.16,4.72,to measure a value you have to take it
1095.36,4.96,out of superposition
1096.88,4.0,so in order to make a qubit that can
1100.32,4.64,correct
1100.88,6.96,for errors you need to have multiple
1104.96,4.079,physical qubits in connection with each
1107.84,3.36,other
1109.039,3.52,that so this is like a theoretical thing
1111.2,3.68,that hasn't actually been
1112.559,5.12,tested built and tested yet but it could
1114.88,6.56,mean that even if we have a hundred
1117.679,6.561,physical qubits you might have 10
1121.44,3.119,logical qubits or error corrected qubits
1124.24,1.52,so
1124.559,3.041,there are a lot of algorithms being
1125.76,3.12,developed but the number of qubits we
1127.6,4.24,have is very small
1128.88,3.36,and noisy so these algorithms are not
1131.84,2.88,like
1132.24,4.559,ready to run so how long is it until you
1134.72,4.64,can run something like node
1136.799,3.361,uh just probably not it's just so
1139.36,2.64,different
1140.16,4.08,the way that people are writing programs
1142.0,4.32,for quantum computers right now
1144.24,3.28,mostly in python these are two different
1146.32,2.96,libraries
1147.52,4.88,uh you say that you're going to build a
1149.28,5.759,circuit that has in this case two qubits
1152.4,3.92,and then you specify the particular
1155.039,5.281,gates like this is
1156.32,7.04,like down to the assembly and gate level
1160.32,3.84,design of your program and then you run
1163.36,2.0,the measurement
1164.16,3.36,and then like i said before if you look
1165.36,4.559,at the bottom it says trials equals 10.
1167.52,4.32,i'm saying do this program 10 times and
1169.919,5.841,tell me what were the
1171.84,6.48,distribution of results uh the first
1175.76,3.52,attempt that i did to work in this space
1178.32,3.12,was
1179.28,4.24,uh so righetti computing which is a
1181.44,2.56,startup that has a python library i sort
1183.52,2.8,of
1184.0,4.16,cribbed off of their python library to
1186.32,3.68,make a javascript library called js
1188.16,2.72,quill so they have pi quill and minus js
1190.0,2.88,quill
1190.88,3.2,and like you could you can see it's a
1192.88,4.32,pretty similar
1194.08,5.52,idea of i'm going to make a
1197.2,3.92,quantum program i'm going to add these
1199.6,4.0,particular gates
1201.12,3.2,to these particular qubits and then
1203.6,4.16,measure
1204.32,7.76,and run based on that
1207.76,6.72,so that came out i want to say 2017
1212.08,3.52,yeah yeah so i was able to put that in
1214.48,3.439,2017.
1215.6,4.24,this is um linked the link that i have
1217.919,4.481,on wikipedia
1219.84,3.12,from somebody it was really interesting
1222.4,3.12,i still get
1222.96,3.92,interested in that to this day but i
1225.52,4.56,want to rewrite it
1226.88,5.2,uh because there's many other
1230.08,4.0,quantum computing providers right now
1232.08,3.599,from microsoft and google
1234.08,3.599,they're running their own cloud quantum
1235.679,3.441,computer even with these small number of
1237.679,3.041,qubits
1239.12,3.28,they don't always call their gates the
1240.72,3.839,same thing
1242.4,3.92,and there also have been some changes to
1244.559,4.961,the api
1246.32,5.2,i also have a bad habit of like just
1249.52,3.44,kind of hacking something together
1251.52,3.12,and not testing how everything worked
1252.96,3.52,out so i wanted to rewrite it in
1254.64,4.56,typescript which was really big
1256.48,5.36,whenever i was thinking about this a
1259.2,4.24,couple years ago
1261.84,2.719,just to give you an idea of how similar
1263.44,2.479,these things are these are three
1264.559,3.761,different libraries
1265.919,3.681,but you can see they're all the little
1268.32,2.32,box they wrote they're all doing the
1269.6,4.16,same thing they're doing an
1270.64,5.039,h gate a c x or c naught gate
1273.76,3.12,and then they're measuring something so
1275.679,2.88,why are there these three different
1276.88,4.72,python libraries that
1278.559,5.36,are written differently and really i
1281.6,4.88,could probably write something that
1283.919,4.64,um in in javascript that would compile
1286.48,5.04,down into each one of these because
1288.559,4.401,they're all doing very similar things so
1291.52,3.76,the library ended up creating it's
1292.96,5.36,called quantum peep
1295.28,4.08,my pitch for it was right once run
1298.32,2.96,anywhere
1299.36,3.52,so that same program you were looking at
1301.28,4.32,earlier in python
1302.88,3.52,there's an x gate a c naught gate and
1305.6,4.48,then you
1306.4,6.72,do the measurement and then on the right
1310.08,3.68,column you'll see that i can compile it
1313.12,3.76,to
1313.76,3.68,quill which is the righetti program q
1316.88,3.919,sharp
1317.44,5.28,which is the uh
1320.799,3.441,microsoft assembly type language and
1322.72,5.36,chasm which
1324.24,5.52,i believe is the ibm type assembly
1328.08,4.56,so these look very different but you can
1329.76,6.0,build your program in the same way
1332.64,6.32,um so
1335.76,4.64,you can do this kind of compatibility
1338.96,3.44,of however whatever you're familiar with
1340.4,3.6,writing and then run it on another
1342.4,4.48,platform
1344.0,5.6,the road ahead uh this is my last slide
1346.88,4.64,uh adoption is very slow ibm even
1349.6,3.36,had their own javascript library called
1351.52,2.88,kiss kit js
1352.96,3.36,and now they've just completely gone
1354.4,4.0,over to python since that's what
1356.32,3.359,most scientists are using i still see a
1358.4,3.36,lot of people
1359.679,3.921,interacting with js quilt i archived it
1361.76,3.039,and told people that quantum peep is
1363.6,4.16,more
1364.799,4.161,is newer and more compatible um but
1367.76,2.48,people don't really seem to see that
1368.96,3.839,they just want to find some
1370.24,4.16,javascript quantum thing uh we don't
1372.799,2.721,have like a hello world program where
1374.4,2.8,people can run it like you know with
1375.52,3.039,arduino you run a program and the light
1377.2,2.08,blinks and you think okay i know how to
1378.559,3.041,code
1379.28,4.32,with this we don't really have like a
1381.6,4.72,getting started with quantum computing
1383.6,4.16,like this is basically the the world
1386.32,3.12,this like create a gate
1387.76,3.76,and then do a c naught get a controlled
1389.44,4.32,knot gate like this
1391.52,3.68,um people don't really feel inspired by
1393.76,2.399,it they're like what am i doing what's
1395.2,2.56,going on here
1396.159,2.801,um so it'd be great if we got enough
1397.76,2.08,qubits that people could do like a
1398.96,3.92,really interesting
1399.84,5.199,quantum random number generator type
1402.88,3.44,experiment that was interesting to them
1405.039,4.481,is like a hello world
1406.32,3.68,problem also talking about the dangers
1409.52,2.48,of
1410.0,3.039,post-quantum encryption or dangers of
1412.0,4.159,quantum computers
1413.039,5.441,and need for post-quantum encryption at
1416.159,5.041,the international atomic energy agency
1418.48,5.12,was one of the greatest experiences of
1421.2,4.4,my life you think there was like a
1423.6,3.92,one percent chance they contributed one
1425.6,4.0,percent to preventing a small
1427.52,3.68,nuclear exchange i think it was the most
1429.6,2.8,impactful day of my life if you think
1431.2,4.32,about it
1432.4,3.6,that way um but yeah if you just a
1435.52,2.08,little
1436.0,4.24,pitch if you can get involved in any
1437.6,5.199,kind of uh program that
1440.24,3.76,helps control nuclear chemical
1442.799,4.961,biological or ai
1444.0,5.2,weapons in our field you
1447.76,3.44,even if there's a small chance that you
1449.2,6.4,can help a little bit it can have a huge
1451.2,6.4,impact on our livability of our future
1455.6,3.92,not to like put us into a weird mind
1457.6,3.199,space but it's it was really interesting
1459.52,2.56,meeting those people and finding out
1460.799,2.641,what they're working on
1462.08,3.04,so i wanted to make a little pitch for
1463.44,4.4,them so yeah
1465.12,4.88,this is the node module uh this is my
1467.84,5.12,github and twitter is not meld
1470.0,4.72,and we went through this very quickly so
1472.96,2.8,i'd be happy to talk in more detail
1474.72,4.4,about
1475.76,6.0,uh some of these uh quantum
1479.12,8.72,programs and how to kind of wrap your
1481.76,6.08,head around it
1489.12,3.52,thank you so much nick that was amazing
1491.12,4.72,uh thank you
1492.64,4.72,appreciate it so um if you have
1495.84,3.36,questions now you can ask them in the
1497.36,4.799,chat and i'll relay them to
1499.2,3.28,nick and we'll have a little bit of time
1502.159,2.4,for
1502.48,3.199,yeah for questions before we go to our
1504.559,4.561,social uh
1505.679,6.561,happy hour on the rambling platform
1509.12,4.4,um but yeah i i think um i guess
1512.24,2.88,my first question is have you have you
1513.52,2.399,used quantum peep for anything
1515.12,2.799,interesting
1515.919,3.201,uh yourself like what are the were those
1517.919,3.601,interesting programs or
1519.12,3.6,things you've done with it i was really
1521.52,4.72,happy when
1522.72,5.92,they had a uh rigetti had a uh
1526.24,4.64,and ibm both had a thing where you could
1528.64,4.159,run against an actual quantum computer
1530.88,3.6,because they will host a simulator and
1532.799,2.561,then occasionally they'll allow people
1534.48,2.559,to run
1535.36,3.28,a program against an actual quantum
1537.039,3.201,computer and
1538.64,3.2,you know goes into a queue and then it
1540.24,2.96,runs it and then emails results back to
1541.84,4.56,you
1543.2,5.28,um that was really exciting that
1546.4,3.759,you know i was able to write something
1548.48,4.559,you know in javascript at home
1550.159,4.321,and then like run it and then get back
1553.039,1.921,something that someone actually built a
1554.48,2.96,quantum
1554.96,3.92,computer somewhere because definitely
1557.44,4.08,like five years ago
1558.88,3.6,the thought was do quantum computers
1561.52,2.56,even really exist
1562.48,3.28,maybe there are a few qubits people have
1564.08,3.599,built and tested so
1565.76,3.76,to have it be so readily available on
1567.679,4.961,the internet and
1569.52,3.92,um that was really i feel like it's good
1572.64,3.519,it made it
1573.44,3.76,seem so much more real at that point um
1576.159,3.201,but no nothing
1577.2,3.52,i'm not like i've interviewed at a few
1579.36,2.559,places that are doing these more
1580.72,5.12,professionally
1581.919,5.521,um but i haven't had this kind of um
1585.84,5.12,you know a problem where i thought oh i
1587.44,3.52,need to use a quantum computer for this
1592.24,3.28,yeah that it does seem like that is the
1593.76,3.68,stage that things are at but um
1595.52,3.2,but i i totally get the excitement about
1597.44,3.28,knowing that you wrote code in
1598.72,4.48,javascript and eventually later ran on
1600.72,4.319,on a real quantum computer that's super
1603.2,4.719,cool
1605.039,3.52,yeah so so um have you have you got a
1607.919,2.561,sense for
1608.559,3.841,um what people are using the library for
1610.48,4.079,do you know who like has anyone kind of
1612.4,4.48,um anyone interesting kind of like made
1614.559,5.36,issues on the github issue tracker
1616.88,3.84,uh or um like are there any secret
1619.919,4.401,agencies
1620.72,6.16,using it i always get a little nervous
1624.32,5.68,when i get a github star from
1626.88,4.799,uh someone in a country where the us is
1630.0,4.72,not supposed to be doing
1631.679,4.801,technical business with um
1634.72,3.36,so that's always a little exciting but i
1636.48,2.88,really encourage everyone to do it
1638.08,3.36,because right now it's just
1639.36,3.52,it's a physics problem it's not like i
1641.44,3.44,don't really believe it's something that
1642.88,5.44,needs to be kept secret
1644.88,5.36,um what i would say about it is i
1648.32,3.359,don't think i think most scientists are
1650.24,3.28,just using the python thing because
1651.679,3.36,that's a very sciency kind of thing to
1653.52,2.96,do it's very like a lot of researchers
1655.039,4.481,are doing that
1656.48,4.96,um so i think
1659.52,3.039,really where this is what is happening
1661.44,3.359,with this and why there's no
1662.559,5.521,compatibility between these different
1664.799,4.0,python libraries either is there's this
1668.08,3.599,thought that
1668.799,3.441,if we convince researchers to use our
1671.679,3.841,tool
1672.24,5.039,kit now there'll be this buy-in and the
1675.52,3.44,future when they do
1677.279,3.52,larger scale commercial quantum
1678.96,2.8,experiments they're going to be more
1680.799,3.681,partial to this
1681.76,4.08,company and their platform so it's
1684.48,3.52,really like
1685.84,4.319,another cloud computing war over which
1688.0,4.32,cloud computing provider is the best
1690.159,3.841,but then they also control how you
1692.32,4.4,program the computer
1694.0,3.76,um so i hope that there can be more of a
1696.72,4.079,generic thing
1697.76,4.48,and amazon bracket
1700.799,3.441,i mean they have their own quantum
1702.24,3.2,computer team so i'm not sure what's
1704.24,4.08,going on with that
1705.44,5.04,um but they do have some kind of similar
1708.32,5.12,cross-platform abilities for a few
1710.48,2.96,different providers
1713.919,3.041,this seems a little bit similar to uh
1716.08,4.319,nvidia's
1716.96,4.56,cuda framework uh that's proprietary and
1720.399,2.64,how like they kind of
1721.52,3.279,for a while i remember like there were
1723.039,3.041,even classes at stanford that
1724.799,2.961,went when i was there that were
1726.08,3.36,specifically like teaching you cuda this
1727.76,4.399,you know this proprietary
1729.44,3.44,framework and then later on when um amd
1732.159,3.681,wanted to like
1732.88,5.279,get into the space they i think they
1735.84,4.64,were the ones who created opencl which
1738.159,4.24,is like the open source version of cuda
1740.48,3.36,and um you know they have it's funny
1742.399,2.721,like the the company that's behind
1743.84,4.8,howells has an incentive
1745.12,5.679,to create like an open source
1748.64,4.0,uh you know framework or standard for
1750.799,2.561,the for things because it just benefits
1752.64,1.84,them to
1753.36,2.72,to to convince people that this
1754.48,2.96,proprietary thing is bad they should use
1756.08,3.199,the open thing and then um
1757.44,3.119,but anyway so i i don't know what the
1759.279,2.88,state of like
1760.559,3.761,like that kind of computing is i think
1762.159,3.041,opencl is pretty pretty popular but i
1764.32,2.64,don't know how
1765.2,3.28,um yeah like whether it's overtaking
1766.96,4.88,cuda or or what
1768.48,4.799,um but uh yeah it sounds like it's just
1771.84,3.28,a similar thing playing out again
1773.279,3.041,in quantum and these companies are yeah
1775.12,4.4,hoping that you're gonna
1776.32,4.88,you're gonna like choose their um their
1779.52,2.399,library and get get sort of locked into
1781.2,3.28,it
1781.919,3.36,yeah so so were there were there any
1784.48,4.24,things you couldn't
1785.279,5.52,um you couldn't do like uh easily across
1788.72,3.92,uh that like were there any sort of i
1790.799,4.0,guess uh things that were so different
1792.64,3.519,like operations or was instructions that
1794.799,4.721,were so different that you couldn't
1796.159,4.0,make something unified yeah the one
1799.52,2.639,thing that
1800.159,3.12,i had a heck of a time trying to figure
1802.159,3.441,out was
1803.279,3.201,there's particular gates that you give
1805.6,4.24,it and
1806.48,4.48,a number the parameter that you give it
1809.84,4.16,is the gate
1810.96,4.56,and a particular number of degrees or
1814.0,3.76,radians
1815.52,3.039,and then i found out in one case if you
1817.76,3.6,send it
1818.559,4.48,let's say you send it 0.25 then that
1821.36,4.48,means like
1823.039,4.0,pi fourths radians right which is a
1825.84,2.88,normal number in math
1827.039,3.441,but then i'm trying to think okay if
1828.72,4.88,someone writes
1830.48,3.919,one-fourth in my code should i multiply
1833.6,4.0,that by pi
1834.399,6.241,should i turn it into radians and
1837.6,4.319,degrees or how should i represent it and
1840.64,4.48,then how do i write it
1841.919,5.441,into the code and they don't have there
1845.12,5.039,it was really tricky finding examples in
1847.36,5.76,their own documentation to know whether
1850.159,6.321,it was expecting it to be
1853.12,6.48,a number or a
1856.48,4.72,number to multiply pi by or you know
1859.6,3.6,just even finding something like that
1861.2,4.079,the documentation is not very easy
1863.2,3.04,and then they assume that you are a
1865.279,3.52,quantum physicist
1866.24,3.439,so it's like a what kind of gate i have
1868.799,3.12,to look up
1869.679,3.281,did are these names meaning the same
1871.919,6.401,thing
1872.96,8.64,um things like that um
1878.32,4.16,yeah i'm curious like i i think maybe
1881.6,2.24,you explained a little bit at the
1882.48,2.16,beginning but maybe you could talk more
1883.84,2.24,about like
1884.64,2.879,how do you how did you get into this
1886.08,3.12,project like and how do you maybe more
1887.519,1.921,generally choose which projects to work
1889.2,2.4,on
1889.44,3.68,because it sounds like you mainly maybe
1891.6,2.799,you didn't have a specific use case in
1893.12,2.96,mind when building this so
1894.399,3.28,um you just yeah i'm just curious to
1896.08,5.28,know more about why you've
1897.679,6.0,gone so deep into this area yeah so
1901.36,3.52,uh not not to make a whole thing about
1903.679,4.0,blockchain or anything
1904.88,4.159,but 2011 i'm in uruguay working on one
1907.679,3.921,laptop per child
1909.039,4.081,and i read an article about bitcoin i
1911.6,2.4,thought oh interesting and i talked to
1913.12,2.24,somebody about it
1914.0,3.6,and you know it was ever and you know
1915.36,4.64,now that person i talked to about it
1917.6,4.079,they invested maybe like you know 30
1920.0,2.799,bucks into bitcoin and now they have you
1921.679,2.72,know
1922.799,3.521,tens hundreds of thousands of dollars
1924.399,2.801,right based on that whereas i was just
1926.32,2.4,like oh that's really
1927.2,3.199,interesting i was like thinking about it
1928.72,3.199,just very theoretically of like i need
1930.399,3.76,to have this in my
1931.919,4.24,mental model of how the universe works
1934.159,2.721,or what people are doing but i never
1936.159,4.321,thought
1936.88,6.0,i literally should spend a day on this
1940.48,3.919,and find out what people are talking
1942.88,3.36,about and as a result
1944.399,3.76,i didn't really think about that until
1946.24,3.36,you know years later when i'm saying
1948.159,2.161,okay now i really should pay attention
1949.6,3.84,to this
1950.32,4.959,so now for me when i'm hearing about in
1953.44,5.28,this case quantum computing
1955.279,4.481,um i was also interested in um fortran
1958.72,2.559,for a little bit
1959.76,3.6,i was like that's something i've heard
1961.279,4.64,of i know that some people are still
1963.36,4.4,using it that there's like some kind of
1965.919,3.12,problem in finding people who understand
1967.76,3.039,this so
1969.039,3.601,maybe i should understand this in case
1970.799,5.281,it becomes more useful
1972.64,4.96,and no kidding one of the
1976.08,2.64,things i got on linkedin when i
1977.6,1.84,interviewed with a quantum computing
1978.72,2.88,company they
1979.44,4.64,contacted me on linkedin and said
1981.6,2.959,javascript and fortran we used both of
1984.08,3.04,those
1984.559,4.24,at our quantum computing lab and i was
1987.12,4.64,like really
1988.799,5.201,like how could it possibly be but you
1991.76,5.12,know they're doing that like low-level
1994.0,4.64,very fast monitoring of their hardware
1996.88,2.56,so they needed something that was like c
1998.64,3.759,or fortran
1999.44,4.56,or something um so it's interesting to
2002.399,3.681,think about
2004.0,3.84,finding these particular niches i never
2006.08,4.4,finished my undergraduate degree
2007.84,3.92,so for me it's always been finding a job
2010.48,3.039,through
2011.76,4.0,they're like oh how could we ever find
2013.519,5.361,somebody to do this particular thing
2015.76,3.84,with mapping or quantum computing or
2018.88,2.96,something
2019.6,3.6,and then that really goes a long way to
2021.84,2.88,getting in the door of saying like oh
2023.2,2.8,yeah i know a little bit about this i
2024.72,3.679,haven't
2026.0,4.84,done it in production but you know so
2028.399,6.081,and such and such
2030.84,5.24,yeah so is there a public simulator
2034.48,3.12,uh or something like that to try out
2036.08,1.92,that someone's asking in the chat about
2037.6,2.959,like
2038.0,4.0,is there a way they can try it yeah i
2040.559,5.041,saw that question um so
2042.0,6.72,ibm i think still is running like a web
2045.6,6.4,ui where you can put together
2048.72,5.359,a program in the ibm language and then
2052.0,3.119,run it and get some info back and it has
2054.079,4.961,a
2055.119,7.28,little ui there amazon bracket
2059.04,6.96,you have to um there's a a
2062.399,4.881,a write-up on aws docs which explains
2066.0,4.32,you have to invite
2067.28,4.319,their quantum user as a permission on
2070.32,4.319,your notebooks or something
2071.599,6.8,but then you can write something in the
2074.639,7.361,sagemaker notebooks on amazon
2078.399,6.72,as for my own thing i used to have just
2082.0,7.599,a quantum simulator
2085.119,7.921,running in the cloud and then when you
2089.599,5.201,um use the app or not use the app when
2093.04,5.28,you use the library
2094.8,5.52,you could send uh your program to that
2098.32,4.0,but i i don't believe that anyone was
2100.32,2.48,really using it sort of felt like why am
2102.32,2.72,i
2102.8,3.039,you know running this i really think
2105.04,3.2,that
2105.839,4.161,the company that open source that
2108.24,2.56,simulator used to have one running all
2110.0,2.079,the time
2110.8,3.2,and i really think they should keep that
2112.079,4.481,going because it was always
2114.0,3.839,like that was that greatly reduces the
2116.56,4.0,barrier to entry
2117.839,4.721,is if someone is running a simulator
2120.56,3.92,somewhere even with a few
2122.56,3.84,simulated qubits so you can just say
2124.48,4.48,okay i'll send you this
2126.4,3.84,and then does that run does this work
2128.96,4.48,how do i
2130.24,4.24,structure my request or my program to be
2133.44,4.159,like the
2134.48,6.32,library um because that that part of it
2137.599,4.881,isn't documented very well
2140.8,3.52,so you can simulate a small number of
2142.48,3.359,qubits it sounds like but um
2144.32,3.519,but like at what point does it make is
2145.839,4.721,it impossible to simulate like is it
2147.839,4.401,is it um are there are the actual
2150.56,3.12,quantum computers
2152.24,3.599,that um you know have these small
2153.68,4.64,numbers of qubits are those simulatable
2155.839,3.52,or does it quickly get out of hand yeah
2158.32,3.2,so the number
2159.359,5.201,i had heard before with something on the
2161.52,5.44,order of like 50 or 60 qubits
2164.56,3.68,that are entangled with each other you
2166.96,4.48,would then need
2168.24,5.28,the most like the most powerful
2171.44,3.36,classical super computers when you get
2173.52,2.64,up to the point so we now have quantum
2174.8,5.279,computers that do that
2176.16,7.199,at the end of 2019 google did the first
2180.079,6.401,what's considered to be the first um
2183.359,5.121,quantum supremacy experiment where they
2186.48,4.879,were able to do something
2188.48,4.08,in quantum computing which would have
2191.359,4.561,taken
2192.56,4.799,multiple you know weeks to simulate on a
2195.92,3.84,very large
2197.359,4.161,a super computer the thing that's a
2199.76,4.8,little bit sketchy about it
2201.52,4.319,is they invented a problem it wasn't a
2204.56,3.2,practical
2205.839,4.161,problem where they were like trying to
2207.76,6.88,do some material science or something
2210.0,6.8,they said oh if we had this particular
2214.64,3.12,question of you know this distribution
2216.8,2.559,of numbers
2217.76,3.68,like they designed an experiment
2219.359,2.48,specifically so that it would be easier
2221.44,3.919,for
2221.839,5.681,a quantum computer to do it and then
2225.359,3.841,ibm's team because they didn't want to
2227.52,4.96,be seen as being second
2229.2,5.6,at quantum supremacy ibm's team said
2232.48,4.4,actually you could do that experiment
2234.8,4.16,with like doing this with your classical
2236.88,3.36,file system on a supercomputer
2238.96,3.44,so they had a really interesting
2240.24,4.72,dialogue about
2242.4,4.64,what is possible to do for this problem
2244.96,4.0,and whether it makes sense to
2247.04,4.079,talk about this problem when it's not
2248.96,4.639,really a problem that real people have
2251.119,3.121,it's more like designed to be you know
2253.599,3.681,who can
2254.24,4.24,compute this better um
2257.28,2.64,so then there's since then there have
2258.48,2.96,been other problems like this that
2259.92,2.72,people have created and done a quantum
2261.44,4.56,supremacy experiment
2262.64,4.24,and um i think there's just like two or
2266.0,2.88,three
2266.88,3.36,examples that are published that people
2268.88,3.76,have done this
2270.24,3.92,um but it's really interesting to think
2272.64,4.56,about that
2274.16,4.0,um eventually i guess that's the first
2277.2,4.0,step towards
2278.16,5.439,finding a problem which is useful and
2281.2,3.84,is would be cool to get the quantum
2283.599,4.161,computer doing it faster than a
2285.04,2.72,classical one
2288.96,4.08,yeah cool well i think that's all the
2291.839,2.721,time we have questions for
2293.04,3.6,uh for now is there anything else you
2294.56,5.2,want to tell everybody before
2296.64,5.439,we go um
2299.76,4.0,um no nothing in particular um i did see
2302.079,3.841,a couple questions asking
2303.76,4.72,you know is this the end of you know
2305.92,5.52,encryption and privacy and secrecy
2308.48,4.48,um i mean i'm hopeful that the
2311.44,3.04,post-quantum encryption methods that
2312.96,5.04,people proposed
2314.48,6.0,can be evaluated by nist and various
2318.0,4.72,researchers and then people can
2320.48,3.76,come to some conclusions about how
2322.72,4.24,useful they are
2324.24,4.879,and i i think it's just more of like an
2326.96,3.84,accident of how we
2329.119,3.361,designed a decrypted encryption in the
2330.8,3.039,first place we never us
2332.48,3.599,we never figured that there would be
2333.839,4.24,this kind of uh
2336.079,3.04,other hardware that would come out and
2338.079,3.201,make it uh
2339.119,3.361,obsolete in the future so it's more like
2341.28,3.839,we need to have this uh
2342.48,5.359,transition over but if you think about
2345.119,4.081,like something like ipv4 to ipv6
2347.839,3.041,even if people know it's coming for
2349.2,3.76,years and years and years you're you're
2350.88,4.479,still gonna have people not knowing
2352.96,3.36,what's going on or how to implement it
2355.359,2.641,and
2356.32,3.519,it's it's definitely something that is
2358.0,2.96,going to be over multiple years people
2359.839,3.041,figuring out
2360.96,3.76,you know is our system compatible are we
2362.88,3.04,ready is this causing some kind of
2364.72,5.119,additional problem
2365.92,3.919,but i'm optimistic about it for sure
2370.4,4.48,cool well uh thanks so much for uh
2373.359,4.48,making this understandable for us
2374.88,3.52,today and uh for making this library and
2377.839,2.24,uh
2378.4,2.8,just explaining that yeah like letting
2380.079,2.881,everything out in a way that's
2381.2,2.8,surprisingly understandable so i
2382.96,5.36,appreciate that
2384.0,4.32,yeah thanks for hosting yeah of course
