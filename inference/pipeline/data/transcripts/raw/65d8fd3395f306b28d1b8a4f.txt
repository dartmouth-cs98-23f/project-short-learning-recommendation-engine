hey everyone welcome to this week's live
session today's topic is top 10 data
analysis tools but before we begin i'd
like to thank our viewers on youtube and
facebook for actively participating in
these sessions
so let's wait for a while for people to
tune in
if you have any questions do feel free
to leave them in our chat section and we
will be happy to answer them also make
sure to subscribe to our channel and hit
the bell icon to never miss an update
now let's get started
before i start off with the top 10 data
analysis tools i'd like to talk a bit
about data analysis
so have you ever wondered why data
analysis is important
there are zillions of companies across
the world all these companies generate a
lot of data they literally work with
this generated data
these companies depend on data to make
crucial decisions which can impact their
businesses
data in its raw format has to be
converted into meaningful information
which can then be used by organizations
this is done by analyzing the generated
data and for this we have data analysis
so what is data analysis
data analysis is not just a single step
but a set of processes it is the process
of collecting data then cleaning it when
i say cleaning it simply means removing
the irrelevant data and then this data
is transformed into meaningful
information
we can simply relate this process to how
you make a jigsaw puzzle just like how
you gather all the pieces together and
fit them accordingly to bring out a
beautiful picture
data analysis also works on almost the
same grounds
to achieve the goals of data analysis we
use a number of data analysis tools
companies rely on these tools to gather
and transform their data into meaningful
insights so which tool should you choose
to analyze your data which tool should
you learn if you want to make a career
in this field we will answer that in
this session
after extensive research we have come up
with these top 10 data analysis tools
here we will look at the features of
each of these tools and the companies
using them so let's start
off at number 10 we have microsoft excel
all of us would have used microsoft
excel at some point right it is easy to
use and one of the best tools for data
analysis
developed by microsoft excel is
basically a spreadsheet program using
excel you can create grids of numbers
text and formulae it is one of the
widely used tools be it in a small or
large setup
the interface of microsoft excel looks
like this
let's now move on to the features of
excel
firstly excel works with almost every
other piece of software in office we can
easily add excel spreadsheets to word
documents and powerpoint presentations
to create more visually appealing
reports or presentations
the windows version of excel supports
programming through microsoft's visual
basic for applications vba
programming with vba allows spreadsheet
manipulation that is difficult with
standard spreadsheet techniques
in addition to this the user can
automate tasks such as formatting or
date organization in vba
one of the biggest benefits of excel is
its ability to organize large amounts of
data into orderly logical spreadsheets
and charts
by doing so it's a lot easier to analyze
data especially while creating graphs
and other visual data representations
the visualization can be generated from
specified group of cells
those were few of the features of
microsoft excel
let's now have a look at the companies
using it
most of the organizations today use
excel few of them that use it for
analysis are the uk based company ernest
and young then we have urban pro wipro
and amazon
moving on to our next data analysis tool
at number nine we have rapidminer

cluster up to 100 times faster in memory
and 10 times faster when running on disk
it supports multiple languages and
allows the developers to write
applications in java scala r or python
spark comes up with 80 high level
operators for interactive querying spark
code for batch processing joins stream
against historical data or run ad hoc
queries on stream state
analytics can be performed better as
spark has a rich set of sql queries
machine learning algorithms complex
analytics etc apache spark provides
fault tolerance through spark rdd spark
resilient distributed data sets are
designed to handle the failure of any
worker node in the cluster thus it
ensures that the loss of data reduces to
zero

data analysis tools
let's now have a question and answer
session please feel free to post your
queries in the comments section and
we'll respond in the chat
before the question answer session let's
recap quickly in the meanwhile y'all can
post your questions in the comment
section below
so at number 10 we have microsoft excel
then at number nine we have rapidminer
at number eight we have talent at number
seven we have nine at number six we have
sas r and python at number five apache
spark at number four
click view at number three
power bi at number two and finally we
have tableau topping the list at number
one
okay so now let's get to the q a session
i can see there are a lot of questions
from our viewers let me go ahead and
address a few of them
so the first question is which
industries are using sas and has sas
become a declining tool since the
emergence of r and python
well sas is used in different domains of
banking industry like risk analytics
marketing analytics and h analytics
sas is majorly used in the healthcare
sector for clinical research and drug
development
sas offers a wide variety of packages
for advanced level analytics like sas
iml which is similar to r sas e minor
among others
of course companies have started using r
and python for data analysis but sas is
still relevant and remains a leader in
almost every sector of business
usually small companies and startups use
r and python as it's free of cost
another question i see on the screen is
i am a fresher which tool would you
recommend me to learn qlikview or
tableau
honestly you can choose any of the two
tools both the tools have a high demand
these days and a lot of companies are
looking for professionals who know click
view and tab view
but both of them have their own pros and
cons tableau is slower than click view
when it comes to in-memory processing
tableau's interface is more
user-friendly and intuitive
qlikview offers phone support during
regular business hours which tableau
does not
okay someone is asking what is the scope
of microsoft excel in the future will it
get overshadowed with the emergence of
more sophisticated analytics tools
indeed it is true that companies are
inventing a number of analytics tools to
ease their businesses but microsoft
excel continues to be the most preferred
tool for reporting and analysis across
the globe
it is being used by junior level
employees and managers to understand the
data and build reports to make business
decisions
also microsoft's power bi tool is built
on top of excel so in future microsoft
excel will not decay at all i hope
that's answered your question
there is another interesting question
that is why has python become the most
dominating programming language for data
analytics and machine learning
initially the python language was
created only for application development
and web development but since it is open
source there was an opportunity for the
python community to come up with
libraries and packages that could be
used for data analytics
python now provides a wide range of
libraries for numerical computation data
analysis and visualization as well as
machine learning some of these libraries
are numpy pandas matplotlib scipy and
scikit learn
so these libraries and their functions
make python the most powerful
programming language for data analytics
and machine learning
so that brings us to the end of the
question and answer session if you have
more questions please leave them in the
comment section below and we will be
happy to assist you
with that we have reached the end of
this video do you agree with our top 10
list think we missed anything important
