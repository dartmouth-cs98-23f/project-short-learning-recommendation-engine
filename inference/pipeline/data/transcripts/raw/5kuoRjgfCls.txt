0.0,4.8,Computer Graphics is used to create all sorts of images.
6.2,4.4,"But at the end of the day they're just
pixels that have been given a certain colour value."
10.6,2.4,Computer Scientists who work in Computer Graphics
13.0,2.4,"work out how to take an object,"
15.4,3.6,"do some calculations and translate that
to a computer screen."
19.0,4.0,For example: we need to think about an object's rotation;
24.6,2.4,its position in 3D space;
32.0,1.6,and its size. [quack]
33.6,4.4,"This also involves specifying colours mathematically,"
38.6,5.4,"and working out what objects should
appear in front of others."
45.6,4.4,"And how to add shadows, and reflections."
52.0,6.0,"Even working out which pixels to use
to draw a circle, or a line"
58.0,1.8,isn't that simple.
59.8,1.8,"In this chapter, we're going to look at"
61.6,2.6,"some of the challenges
and some of the calculations needed"
64.2,1.8,to get the right pixels
66.6,1.8,in the right places
69.2,2.8,on the screen.
