12.12,5.64,meta Google and a small size d2c startup
15.179,4.501,that is running from Jakarta is it the
17.76,4.2,product their services or their work
19.68,4.259,culture not really the biggest common
21.96,4.8,denominator between old tech companies
23.939,4.861,globally today's data and AI the
26.76,3.9,overarching need of utilizing data for
28.8,4.62,decision making and implementing the
30.66,4.62,almost necessary capabilities of AI in a
33.42,3.479,product or service has become the demand
35.28,3.48,of the hour all things considered
36.899,4.081,wouldn't it be amazing if you can
38.76,5.1,utilize AI to perform some of the most
40.98,5.04,complex processing and analytics task on
43.86,4.62,data I think your answer would be yes
46.02,4.14,with that being said hello everyone and
48.48,4.62,welcome to this extremely important

339.78,3.84,competitive advantage and drive
341.34,4.98,data-driven decision making across
343.62,5.1,various domains thus energy between Ai
346.32,5.04,and analytics is revolutionizing how
348.72,5.28,businesses abstract insights from data
351.36,3.96,leading to transformative outcomes and
354.0,3.539,Innovations
355.32,4.56,if you are watching this I believe you
357.539,4.321,are either an aspiring data analyst or a
359.88,4.98,professional already now the question of
361.86,4.86,the r is Will AI replace you should I
364.86,4.5,even care to proceed with a career in
366.72,4.5,data analytics don't worry we are here
369.36,4.38,to answer your questions and make things
371.22,3.66,less complicated or we believe we can
373.74,4.739,sort it out
374.88,7.379,now ai is designed to assist humans for
378.479,6.241,example chat Jeopardy bad and Bing the
382.259,5.041,smart AI language models can automate
384.72,5.16,the time consuming tasks such as writing
387.3,5.04,down emails performing data extraction
389.88,5.4,transformation and loading and
392.34,5.88,exploratory analysis and Reporting
395.28,5.28,however in the real time every
398.22,4.68,organization has specifically customized
400.56,6.06,needs and requirements a special set of
402.9,5.94,KRS and kpis to address you may have to
406.62,4.799,understand the business requirements and
408.84,4.5,build the custom dashboards you may have
411.419,5.821,to understand the real-time streaming of
413.34,6.78,data integrate AWS with power bi not
417.24,6.48,just these there are a gazillion tasks
420.12,6.299,that need human intervention and logics
423.72,4.44,AI still lacks the human cognition and
426.419,4.141,the ability acquiring the domain
428.16,4.319,knowledge which only a human can you as
430.56,4.38,a data analyst may need to understand
432.479,4.261,that AI can perform a redundant and
434.94,3.84,straightforward task but not the
436.74,4.38,critical operations which completely
438.78,4.979,rely on a human
441.12,4.979,only a human has the caliber to decode
443.759,4.681,the intentions of the client and
446.099,3.781,simplify the technical Concepts to known
448.44,3.599,technical client
449.88,5.7,has a strong focus on the business
452.039,6.06,outcomes most importantly try to unravel
