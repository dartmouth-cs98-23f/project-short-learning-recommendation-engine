0.0,3.72,welcome back to my YouTube channel in
2.34,3.06,this video we'll be discussing the
3.72,3.539,differences between machine learning and
5.4,4.32,natural language processing
7.259,3.96,the phrase artificial intelligence is
9.72,3.48,frequently associated with complex
11.219,4.021,Concepts like machine learning natural
13.2,3.839,language processing and deep learning
15.24,3.9,which are interrelated
17.039,3.601,a popular topic of discussion is the
19.14,3.6,distinctions between natural language
20.64,4.08,processing and machine learning
22.74,3.539,this video aims to clarify the
24.72,3.299,relationship between these two vital
26.279,4.32,subfields of artificial intelligence
28.019,4.38,machine learning and NLP
30.599,2.821,this video is going to be very
32.399,3.361,interesting
33.42,4.139,but before the video starts I recommend
35.76,3.18,you to subscribe our Channel and join us
37.559,2.581,on this journey of Discovery and
38.94,3.48,innovation
40.14,3.72,so let's delve into the details and
42.42,4.2,explore the distinction between machine
43.86,4.44,learning and natural language processing
46.62,3.36,machine learning and natural language
48.3,3.48,processing are both components of
49.98,3.239,artificial intelligence but they differ
51.78,3.66,significantly
53.219,3.781,as you familiar with term AI which is a
55.44,3.0,technology that makes machines smart
57.0,3.3,like humans
58.44,3.66,thus machine learning is a branch of
60.3,3.899,artificial intelligence that utilizes
62.1,4.32,statistical methods to tackle large data
64.199,4.321,sets without any human involvement
66.42,3.78,this technique enables the resolution of
68.52,3.66,problems in a manner similar to how
70.2,4.5,humans approach them but using automated
72.18,4.619,processes and massive amounts of data
74.7,3.84,machine learning algorithms are highly
76.799,4.86,effective in areas like natural language
78.54,5.04,processing computer vision and Robotics
81.659,4.021,it is a valuable approach for addressing
83.58,3.96,real-world AI challenges as it involves
85.68,3.299,algorithms that teach machines to learn
87.54,3.719,and improve Based on data without
88.979,3.96,requiring explicit programming
91.259,4.441,on the other hand natural language
92.939,4.5,processing NLP is a subfield of
95.7,3.48,artificial intelligence that deals with
97.439,3.781,processing raw written text in natural
99.18,4.079,human languages and transforming it into
101.22,4.56,a computer-readable format
103.259,4.441,NLP is capable of Performing intelligent
105.78,4.44,analysis on vast amounts of plain text
107.7,4.44,and producing valuable insights from it
110.22,3.42,this technological advancement has
112.14,3.54,revolutionized communication between
113.64,3.78,humans and machines leading to the
115.68,4.079,creation of innovative applications such
117.42,5.339,as sentiment analyzers text classifiers
119.759,4.981,chat Bots and virtual assistants
122.759,3.841,virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa
124.74,4.739,are some of the most well-known examples
126.6,5.7,of NLP technology that we use daily
129.479,4.681,is NLP considered machine learning
132.3,3.72,the figure below shows that natural
134.16,3.659,language processing and machine learning
136.02,3.719,have some similarities
137.819,4.321,machine learning is frequently used to
139.739,4.561,support natural language processing
142.14,4.62,additionally NLP uses various
144.3,5.579,pre-processing techniques such as
146.76,5.4,1. tokenization a method to identify key
149.879,4.981,components of sentences or words
152.16,4.56,2. POS tagging a machine learning
154.86,5.34,technique that identifies and tags parts
156.72,4.86,of speech nouns verbs etc for entity
160.2,3.539,extraction
161.58,3.72,three entity extraction a machine
163.739,3.601,learning technique that extracts
165.3,4.56,entities from Text data
167.34,4.32,4. limitization and stemming techniques
169.86,5.519,that simplify words to their basic form
171.66,5.46,for easier analysis 5. stop word removal
175.379,3.301,a technique that removes commonly
177.12,5.52,occurring words that do not add meaning
178.68,6.36,to the analysis such as me them and have
182.64,4.14,natural language processing requires an
185.04,4.74,understanding of how humans use language
186.78,4.92,including sarcasm humor and bias in
189.78,3.959,different types of Text data
191.7,3.84,machine learning algorithms can be used
193.739,4.021,to automate the discovery of patterns in
195.54,4.08,Text data but first unstructured text
197.76,3.899,Data must be converted into a structured
199.62,4.08,format such as a table
201.659,3.841,machine learning techniques for NLP
203.7,3.78,involve using statistical methods to
205.5,3.0,identify parts of speech sentiments
207.48,2.1,entities
208.5,2.76,Etc
209.58,3.54,these techniques can be used in
211.26,3.6,supervised learning models where the
213.12,3.42,model is trained on existing data and
214.86,3.54,applied to new data sets or in
216.54,3.419,unsupervised learning where algorithms
218.4,3.839,are used to extract patterns and make
219.959,4.681,decisions from large data sets
222.239,3.481,so can you learn NLP without machine
224.64,2.819,learning
225.72,3.78,machine learning is essential for
227.459,3.961,natural language processing just as math
229.5,3.959,is essential for physics
231.42,3.84,in physics we use math to represent
233.459,3.42,problems as equations and solve them
235.26,3.539,using calculus
236.879,3.961,similarly we use machine learning
238.799,3.421,techniques to formulate and solve NLP
240.84,3.959,problems
242.22,6.12,techniques like POS tagging bag of words
244.799,5.58,bow tfidf and word to Vector are used to
248.34,3.78,structure Text data and machine learning
250.379,3.601,is a necessary prerequisite for these
252.12,3.72,techniques to be effective
253.98,3.659,however there is another term to
255.84,4.38,consider deep learning
257.639,3.78,so the question arises is NLP a part of
260.22,3.18,deep learning
261.419,3.241,the diagram below illustrates the
263.4,3.359,interconnectedness of artificial
264.66,4.74,intelligence machine learning natural
266.759,4.44,language processing and deep learning
269.4,4.2,deep learning a subset of machine
271.199,4.141,learning uses artificial neural networks
273.6,3.18,and large data sets to replicate the
275.34,3.9,functioning of the human brain and
276.78,5.4,recognize patterns for decision making
279.24,4.679,NLP on the other hand aims to enable
282.18,3.42,communication between humans and
283.919,3.901,machines by facilitating real-time
285.6,4.56,access to human languages
287.82,4.08,both NLP and deep learning are parts of
290.16,3.539,artificial intelligence with deep
291.9,3.54,learning enhancing NLP applications
293.699,3.361,through Vector mapping and increased
295.44,2.94,accuracy without significant human
297.06,3.54,intervention
298.38,3.9,the abundance of data also makes deep
300.6,3.36,learning suitable for unsupervised
302.28,3.78,learning in NLP
303.96,3.72,in conclusion machine learning and
306.06,2.94,natural language processing are both
307.68,2.579,integral parts of artificial
309.0,2.639,intelligence but they differ
310.259,3.181,significantly
311.639,3.541,machine learning involves the use of
313.44,3.42,statistical methods to analyze large
315.18,3.84,data sets without human involvement
316.86,3.899,while natural language processing deals
319.02,3.54,with transforming raw written text in
320.759,4.681,human languages into a machine-readable
322.56,4.859,format machine learning is crucial for
325.44,4.02,NLP as it provides the necessary
327.419,3.06,techniques to structure and analyze Text
329.46,2.94,data
330.479,4.141,deep learning a subset of machine
332.4,4.38,learning also plays a significant role
334.62,4.139,in NLP enhancing its applications
336.78,3.0,through increased accuracy and Vector
338.759,3.241,mapping
339.78,4.139,so here the video ends if you enjoyed
