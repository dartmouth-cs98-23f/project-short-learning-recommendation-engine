second,duration,transcript
1.839,4.801,okay let's
3.36,7.199,get into it um
6.64,7.28,web designing and programming
10.559,6.48,well the name itself might look
13.92,6.32,not that complicated you can just
17.039,6.48,imagine like web designing
20.24,5.44,is about putting pretty buttons on top
23.519,4.721,of pretty photos
25.68,3.519,and where programming would be like
28.24,4.64,positioning
29.199,5.841,those buttons and photos with html as
32.88,5.199,css
35.04,5.28,well yes basically it is but um
38.079,3.521,if you start learning about how to
40.32,5.44,design and
41.6,7.439,program a product for our case
45.76,6.639,a website that many people
49.039,6.561,should visit and enjoy using it
52.399,6.32,like the facebook or reddit um
55.6,6.24,learning but learning
58.719,6.72,uh the theoretical
61.84,6.88,theoretical parts of building websites
65.439,4.72,um in order to get attention from the
68.72,5.04,users
70.159,6.801,can get complicated
73.76,6.32,well it's a broad broad field of study
76.96,3.76,um i should say um it's a whole bigger
80.08,4.24,than
80.72,6.719,just choose a color
84.32,6.799,and import a photo with html
87.439,6.881,tag we should go through at least
91.119,5.761,some of the topics that other bigger
94.32,6.72,universities outside our country
96.88,7.76,study so here um
101.04,7.52,we will be talking about hci
104.64,7.36,first human computer interaction
108.56,6.72,first uh it is a study of
112.0,6.56,a relationship between you and your
115.28,6.32,website that is shown on a computer to
118.56,3.04,put it simply
122.32,6.72,um let me prepare my pen
126.479,2.561,i forgot
129.599,3.121,okay um
131.06,5.42,[Music]
132.72,7.44,well computers are becoming
136.48,8.32,more and more ubiquitous in our
140.16,7.76,our world of life computers are
144.8,5.28,everywhere well
147.92,3.679,well that's why we are in computer
150.08,4.96,science department right
151.599,6.961,um learning about about computers
155.04,7.199,so what is computer guys
158.56,6.8,can someone answer that well let's see
162.239,6.241,the short description of a computer
165.36,6.48,it is a electronic device for storing
168.48,3.36,and processing data
172.16,5.04,in the short um well okay so
177.599,4.481,is uh so is computer the desktop
181.44,4.0,computer
182.08,6.159,in front of you yes it is
185.44,4.32,but also the monitor you're watching
188.239,5.121,this video
189.76,7.119,is a computer phone in your pocket is
193.36,6.799,also a computer watch on your wrist
196.879,3.28,card dashboard system
200.959,3.681,that shows the mileage or some
203.2,4.399,electronic toys
204.64,4.159,some refrigerators you could see in the
207.599,4.161,movies which
208.799,4.641,checks the content inside and suggests
211.76,4.96,us the shopping list
213.44,6.719,well in this rapidly growing
216.72,6.879,and developing technology era
220.159,6.481,computers are almost part of everything
223.599,5.521,so again this is the reason we
226.64,3.84,need to study and learn about human
229.12,4.56,computer
230.48,6.319,interaction hci designing
233.68,3.839,and make some great life-changing or
236.799,3.921,maybe
237.519,4.08,world-changing project design well for
240.72,5.04,our case
241.599,8.321,a website website is the product
245.76,8.479,cool way the facebook website
249.92,7.68,changed many people's life you know
254.239,6.641,me let's see
257.6,5.52,the description of hci that i found from
260.88,6.24,the internet
263.12,6.72,and well i find it very accurate
267.12,2.72,um
270.72,9.28,okay human computer interaction
275.68,5.36,hci is a multidisciplinary field of
280.0,3.84,study
281.04,3.76,focusing on the design of computer
283.84,5.04,technology
284.8,7.76,and particularly the interaction between
288.88,7.12,humans and the computers
292.56,5.6,so it is a study of not only the
296.0,4.08,visual designing and programming the
298.16,4.0,project you might imagine
300.08,3.119,but it is about studying and
302.16,4.4,understanding
303.199,6.801,humans and their mind
306.56,4.0,psychology how people how users might
310.0,3.759,work
310.56,4.72,how people interact interact with a
313.759,5.761,certain computerized
315.28,7.84,product interface like website
319.52,6.399,so it's about again it's about how you
323.12,5.12,interact with your smartphones and
325.919,6.0,application on it
328.24,7.2,it is a very broad area of study um
331.919,7.921,phew are you excited
335.44,4.4,okay um
340.72,6.319,um let's take a close look at
344.24,3.519,humans from human computer interaction
347.039,5.281,design
347.759,9.041,the first word um this human
352.32,8.8,okay uh we humans um
356.8,5.36,we here um we humans perceive the world
361.12,4.079,around us
362.16,6.4,through our five senses as we know
365.199,6.801,seeing on hearing
368.56,6.72,and um feeling not
372.0,6.4,this feeling too and this feeling but
375.28,6.88,um tasting and smelling
378.4,7.6,are actually excluded in this very study
382.16,6.8,unless you guys develop a
386.0,3.759,website uh for example a cooking website
388.96,3.92,that
389.759,6.241,senses taste and smell though
392.88,6.24,anyways uh also we have memories
396.0,6.8,or experience skill
399.12,7.04,and knowledge and wisdom
402.8,7.04,so why are we talking about these well
406.16,6.599,again when we design a product
409.84,4.24,a website we must take into
412.759,4.761,consideration
414.08,7.92,every element of the human
417.52,7.6,from way they perceive and interact
422.0,3.12,with the computer
427.36,6.399,um okay because websites
430.639,6.721,are for humans humans use it
433.759,6.641,not cats or hamsters no offense to the
437.36,3.04,cats and hamsters
440.479,7.44,okay as we have mentioned earlier that
444.88,7.12,computers are everywhere
447.919,7.041,tablets smartphones smartwatch cameras
452.0,3.68,thermostat car dashboard plain dashboard
454.96,4.0,gamepad
455.68,6.4,electronic toys fridges video um
458.96,8.0,vr games etc
462.08,8.48,um you know from the gamepad here um
466.96,6.799,you might have understood that computer
470.56,4.56,interface just doesn't necessarily have
473.759,4.56,to be with
475.12,5.6,a touchable or watchable screen
478.319,3.681,it can be all types of shapes with all
480.72,4.08,types of buttons
482.0,5.36,those can be interacted with that's an
484.8,2.56,interface
488.4,6.72,also there are more advanced
491.68,6.48,and more future fields of hci
495.12,4.639,which are virtual reality beings for
498.16,4.719,medical field
499.759,5.201,or architecture designing and of course
502.879,5.6,gaming
504.96,7.04,and um here dexter haptic gloves
508.479,6.8,here which were invented to mimic touch
512.0,6.88,sensations of hardness softness
515.279,7.841,aspringiness and more when using virtual
518.88,5.68,reality um also pre-touch sensing phones
523.12,4.96,here
524.56,6.64,that read your minds
528.08,4.8,well no they don't read our minds well
531.2,4.8,the pre-touched phones
532.88,6.639,should be able to understand how the
536.0,6.56,user is holding it or what fingers
539.519,6.32,are approaching the screen
542.56,6.32,to predict what the user wants to do
545.839,6.161,so it's a prediction game a bit similar
548.88,4.56,with iron man interacting with his
552.0,5.839,computer
553.44,7.04,any marvel fans this would give
557.839,4.161,the sense that your phone can read your
560.48,4.16,mind as it performs
562.0,3.92,actions before you even give you give
564.64,4.4,your phone
565.92,6.4,a clear command
569.04,5.44,and finally a paper id is about
572.32,6.24,digitalizing paper
574.48,6.08,right yes making the paper into a
578.56,5.04,touchscreen
580.56,6.959,this new technology supposedly
583.6,7.04,will give paper the ability to sense
587.519,4.081,its surroundings and respond to gesture
590.64,3.28,commands
591.6,3.52,as well as connect to the internet of
593.92,3.44,things okay
595.12,2.24,cool
598.48,3.76,okay the third word
602.32,7.6,from human computer interaction design
606.48,7.52,interaction is a kind of
609.92,9.919,action that occurs as two or more
614.0,5.839,objects have an effect upon one another
623.279,7.841,okay you push a button on a screen
627.36,7.44,computer will show us a new window
631.12,6.8,as a response and go back and forth
634.8,3.12,that's the interaction
638.48,3.84,action between you and the computer is
641.12,4.88,an interaction
642.32,6.8,in one sentence you can um summarize
646.0,5.6,but even though you are interacting with
649.12,3.68,the computer interface or graphical user
651.6,5.76,interface
652.8,8.56,you are actually doing a task
657.36,7.76,okay that you want to do
661.36,8.64,um to do through the interface
665.12,8.24,here you actually want to send an email
670.0,6.56,or buy issues or shoot zombies
673.36,6.479,etc you shouldn't forget
676.56,7.12,that users i mean p we
679.839,7.12,people use computer to do a task
683.68,4.0,through the graphical interface what i
686.959,3.921,mean
687.68,6.24,what i mean is hci doesn't
690.88,7.199,end with these two human
693.92,7.599,and computer but should always consider
698.079,3.44,this the task
701.68,7.12,so the designer or developer's goal
705.12,7.519,our goal is to help humans
708.8,8.24,feel like they're interacting directly
712.639,7.601,with the task
717.04,5.2,while the interface um kind of
720.24,4.399,vanishes in the middle of that
722.24,6.0,interaction like this
724.639,7.681,which literally means we should let
728.24,6.0,the users spend as much time as possible
732.32,4.56,thinking about the task instead of
734.24,5.52,thinking about the interface
736.88,4.0,like for example like uh people should
739.76,4.879,be thinking about
740.88,6.959,what to write to sarah
744.639,5.841,the friend but um not like people
747.839,5.841,uh should be thinking about should i
750.48,6.08,mean people should not be thinking about
753.68,4.959,like where is the inbox folder where is
756.56,5.2,the new email button or
758.639,8.32,what this button is for
761.76,8.16,okay now the last
766.959,5.201,the last word from human computer
769.92,5.919,interaction design
772.16,7.119,this is the word i love the most
775.839,4.24,design let's see some descriptions that
779.279,4.881,i find
780.079,7.121,them accurate design
784.16,6.239,is the process of imagining and planning
787.2,5.36,the creation of objects systems
790.399,5.521,buildings vehicles etc
792.56,6.56,it is about creating solutions for
795.92,6.719,people okay design
799.12,6.959,is the creation of the products
802.639,6.561,and the services that people use design
806.079,7.121,makes technology usable for people
809.2,7.12,design connects people with technology
813.2,8.16,you get it okay and good design
816.32,5.04,is really about solving problems
821.76,3.759,well the last sentence is the sentence
824.72,4.0,you must
825.519,6.241,repeat to yourselves every time
828.72,7.119,every moment you design something
831.76,4.079,your design should solve problems
836.079,3.921,more the better uh that what designers
839.68,3.36,do
840.0,6.399,they solve problems okay
843.04,6.4,um then what is a
846.399,5.68,good design as i said
849.44,4.399,design should solve problems that's the
852.079,5.361,main thing
853.839,7.041,a good design is effective and efficient
857.44,6.959,in fulfilling its purpose purpose of
860.88,6.56,solving a problem it relies on
864.399,6.641,as few external factors and inputs
867.44,6.88,as possible simple the better and
871.04,6.72,these are easy to measure and manipulate
874.32,6.0,to achieve an expected other output
877.76,5.12,a good design is always the simplest
880.32,6.639,possible working solution
882.88,7.12,okay um
886.959,5.12,every project is a problem or challenge
890.0,3.199,that involves helping other people
892.079,4.721,understand
893.199,3.601,something okay
897.04,6.799,can you see how the water
900.32,6.879,water drum help helped the woman
903.839,6.401,and young children into south africa
907.199,6.161,this photo the design of
910.24,6.32,this water drum changed their lives
913.36,3.76,helping them designers saw the struggle
916.56,3.6,of
917.12,5.44,women and children bringing heavy heavy
920.16,5.44,water to their homes
922.56,6.16,do the designers solve the problem with
925.6,4.88,this simple but very effective and
928.72,5.28,useful drum
930.48,5.52,that holds lots of water and doesn't
934.0,5.92,need to be lifted from the ground
936.0,7.12,not heavy and can travel long distances
939.92,3.2,you can just push it
943.759,7.2,okay what about the next one it says
947.12,6.639,there is no planet b like the plan b
950.959,3.761,well this single poster has one short
953.759,5.44,sentence
954.72,6.32,with one image simple as possible but
959.199,3.601,you do understand the message it's
961.04,4.56,trying to convey right
962.8,4.159,save the earth okay from this you can
965.6,4.4,understand
966.959,3.68,that good design should be meaningful it
970.0,3.519,sends
970.639,5.841,message in the simplest way and the most
973.519,5.841,effective way possible
976.48,5.76,well because well people are lazy they
979.36,5.52,don't want to read lots of texts
982.24,5.76,okay for the third design wayfinding
984.88,6.399,signs that you can see at airports
988.0,6.32,without easy to understand signs
991.279,5.521,how can you find the toilet or the
994.32,4.4,boarding gate when there is no one to
996.8,5.2,ask
998.72,6.16,on old and young people
1002.0,3.92,all around the world that uses all
1004.88,3.36,different languages
1005.92,5.2,should be able able to understand the
1008.24,6.959,toilet size shouldn't they
1011.12,4.079,this design solve the problem
1015.6,4.88,okay when it comes to designing and
1018.56,4.88,developing a product
1020.48,4.88,whether it's a water drum or website or
1023.44,4.08,a poster
1025.36,4.16,you have got to understand what design
1027.52,4.319,thinking is
1029.52,4.159,well same again it's about solving
1031.839,6.48,problems in the most
1033.679,7.201,creative and innovative way
1038.319,4.0,well first you have to emphasize
1040.88,4.799,people's problem
1042.319,6.72,like the water drum problem
1045.679,6.401,then uh um i mean
1049.039,3.76,not then i'm emphasizing um you have to
1052.08,3.52,understand
1052.799,3.681,how and why people are struggling with
1055.6,5.439,what
1056.48,9.68,that's the emphasizing step first step
1061.039,8.561,and then and then define the problem
1066.16,5.519,um like um
1069.6,4.0,you should just think like okay this is
1071.679,4.161,the problem i found the problem
1073.6,3.68,that's the defining and then you get
1075.84,5.12,some ideas and sketch
1077.28,5.84,of the solution solution product
1080.96,4.32,like the water drum sketches and then
1083.12,5.84,make the prototype of them
1085.28,7.04,try try to make the um
1088.96,7.52,a prototype means the similar
1092.32,6.56,working product to the final product
1096.48,3.76,similar to the final product and then
1098.88,5.12,test them to see
1100.24,5.76,how it works and it's not working
1104.0,4.32,you have to fix the box that's the
1106.0,4.799,testing step
1108.32,3.12,okay the most important part of this
1110.799,3.76,cycle
1111.44,6.8,is actually emphasizing the first step
1114.559,6.0,the starting point understanding people
