10.24,4.399,let's now start this lesson by defining
12.48,4.24,what data visualization is
14.639,4.001,data visualization is the technique to
16.72,3.36,present the data in a pictorial or
18.64,3.28,graphical format
20.08,4.56,it enables stakeholders and decision
21.92,5.119,makers to analyze data visually
24.64,4.479,the data in graphical format allows them
27.039,4.961,to identify new trends and patterns
29.119,4.96,easily well you might think why data
32.0,4.48,visualization is important
34.079,4.16,let's explain with an example
36.48,4.32,you are a sales manager in a leading
38.239,4.721,global organization the organization
40.8,5.2,plans to study the sales details of each
42.96,4.88,product across all regions and countries
46.0,3.76,this is to identify the product which
47.84,4.48,has the highest sales in a particular
49.76,4.08,region and up the production
52.32,3.04,this research will enable the
53.84,3.44,organization to increase the
55.36,3.519,manufacturing of that product in the
57.28,3.599,particular region
58.879,4.32,the data involved for this research
60.879,4.721,might be huge and complex
63.199,4.481,the research on this large numeric data
65.6,4.559,is difficult and time consuming when it
67.68,4.56,is performed manually
70.159,4.721,when this numeric data is plotted on a
72.24,4.8,graph or converted to charts it's easy
74.88,4.08,to identify the patterns and predict the
77.04,4.32,result accurately
78.96,3.76,the main benefits of data visualization
81.36,3.6,are as follows
82.72,5.2,it simplifies the complex quantitative
84.96,4.72,information it helps analyze and explore
87.92,3.839,big data easily
89.68,4.16,it identifies the areas that need
91.759,4.081,attention or improvement
93.84,4.239,it identifies the relationship between
95.84,4.48,data points and variables
98.079,5.121,it explores new patterns and reveals
100.32,5.119,hidden patterns in the data
103.2,5.12,there are three major considerations for
105.439,5.36,data visualization they are clarity
108.32,4.96,accuracy and efficiency
110.799,4.64,first ensure the data set is complete
113.28,4.479,and relevant this enables the data
115.439,4.881,scientist to use the new pattern's yield
117.759,4.801,from the data in the relevant places
120.32,4.32,second ensure using appropriate
122.56,3.519,graphical representation to convey the
124.64,3.839,right message
126.079,4.481,third use efficient visualization
128.479,3.521,technique which highlights all the data
130.56,3.36,points
132.0,3.68,there are some basic factors that one
133.92,3.679,would need to be aware of before
135.68,3.279,visualizing the data
137.599,3.201,visual effect
138.959,3.841,coordination system
140.8,4.56,data types and scale
142.8,4.799,informative interpretation
145.36,4.879,visual effect includes the usage of
147.599,4.961,appropriate shapes colors and size to
150.239,4.401,represent the analyzed data
152.56,3.92,the coordinate system helps to organize
154.64,3.28,the data points within the provided
156.48,3.839,coordinates
157.92,5.84,the data types and scale choose the type
160.319,5.521,of data such as numeric or categorical
163.76,3.92,the informative interpretation helps
165.84,4.399,create visuals in an effective and
167.68,5.76,easily interpretable manner using labels
170.239,4.961,title legends and pointers
173.44,3.76,so far you have learned what data
175.2,4.48,visualization is and how it helps
177.2,3.44,interpret results with large and complex
179.68,2.88,data
180.64,3.92,with the help of the python programming
182.56,3.52,language you can perform this data
184.56,3.44,visualization
186.08,3.76,you'll learn more about how to visualize
188.0,5.599,data using the python programming
189.84,3.759,language in the subsequent screens
195.36,4.56,many new python data visualization
197.599,5.841,libraries are introduced recently
199.92,4.56,such as matplot library vispy boca
203.44,4.32,seaborne
204.48,5.839,pigel folium and networks
207.76,5.039,the matplot library has emerged as the
210.319,4.321,main data visualization library
212.799,4.961,let's now learn about this matplot
214.64,3.12,library in detail
219.04,3.919,matplot library is a python
220.959,3.92,two-dimensional plotting library for
222.959,4.721,data visualization and creating
224.879,5.44,interactive graphics or plots
227.68,5.279,using python's matplot library the data
230.319,4.401,visualization of large and complex data
232.959,3.761,becomes easy
234.72,4.879,there are several advantages of using
236.72,4.879,matplot library to visualize data
239.599,4.481,they are as follows
241.599,5.041,it's a multi-platform data visualization
244.08,3.68,tool built on the numpy and scipy
246.64,4.08,framework
247.76,5.119,therefore it's fast and efficient
250.72,4.4,it possesses the ability to work well
252.879,4.001,with many operating systems and graphic
255.12,3.92,back-ends
256.88,4.639,it possesses high quality graphics and
259.04,5.68,plots to print and view for a range of
261.519,6.721,graphs such as histograms bar charts pie
264.72,5.759,charts scatter plots and heat maps
268.24,4.239,with jupiter notebook integration the
270.479,4.401,developers have been free to spend their
272.479,4.0,time implementing features rather than
274.88,3.759,struggling with cross-platform
276.479,4.401,compatibility
278.639,3.761,it has large community support and
280.88,3.759,cross-platform support
282.4,4.48,as it is an open source tool
284.639,5.041,it has full control over graph or plot
286.88,5.759,styles such as line properties fonts and
289.68,2.959,axis properties
294.8,5.28,let's now try to understand a plot
297.759,4.561,a plot is a graphical representation of
300.08,4.32,data which shows relationship between
302.32,3.28,two variables or the distribution of
304.4,3.92,data
305.6,4.879,look at the example shown on the screen
308.32,4.4,this is a two-dimensional line plot of
310.479,4.72,the random numbers on the y-axis and the
312.72,4.4,range on the x-axis
315.199,2.961,the background of the plot is called
317.12,3.84,grid
318.16,5.68,the text first plot denotes the title of
320.96,5.28,the plot and text line one denotes the
323.84,2.4,legend
328.16,3.68,you can create a plot using four simple
330.639,3.28,steps
331.84,5.44,import the required libraries
333.919,5.361,define or import the required data set
337.28,5.52,set the plot parameters
339.28,3.52,display the created plot
344.32,3.599,let's consider the same example plot
346.56,3.359,used earlier
347.919,3.521,follow the steps below to obtain this
349.919,3.601,plot
351.44,3.28,the first step is to import the required
353.52,4.399,libraries
354.72,5.84,here we have imported numpy and pi plot
357.919,4.881,and style from matplot library
360.56,4.72,numpy is used to generate the random
362.8,4.72,numbers and the pi plot which is built
365.28,4.639,in python library is used to plot
367.52,4.48,numbers and style classes used for
369.919,4.481,setting the grid style
372.0,6.0,matplot library inline is required to
374.4,5.84,display the plot within jupiter notebook
378.0,4.16,the second step is to define or import
380.24,4.32,the required data set
382.16,5.599,here we have defined the data set random
384.56,5.6,number using numpy random method
387.759,4.081,note that the range is 10.
390.16,4.159,we have used the print method to view
391.84,4.96,the created random numbers the third
394.319,4.561,step is to set the plot parameters
396.8,2.959,in this step we set the style of the
398.88,3.039,plot
399.759,5.201,labels of the coordinates title of the
401.919,6.081,plot the legend and the line width
404.96,4.72,in this example we have used ggplot as
408.0,3.84,the plot style
409.68,4.4,the plot method is used to plot the
411.84,4.799,graph against the random numbers
414.08,4.959,in the plot method the word g denotes
416.639,4.881,the plot line color as green
419.039,4.401,label denotes the legend label and it's
421.52,4.799,named as line one
423.44,5.68,also the line width is set to two note
426.319,5.681,that we have labeled the x-axis as range
429.12,5.519,and the y-axis as labels and set the
432.0,4.56,title as first plot
434.639,3.041,the last step is to display the created
436.56,3.52,plot
437.68,4.799,use the legend method to plot the graph
440.08,6.72,based on the set conditions and the show
442.479,4.321,method to display the created plot
448.72,3.599,let's now learn how to create a
450.56,3.84,two-dimensional plot
452.319,4.481,consider the following example
454.4,4.32,a nutri worldwide firm wants to know how
456.8,3.679,many people visit its website at a
458.72,3.759,particular time
460.479,4.401,this analysis helps it control and
462.479,4.881,monitor the website traffic
464.88,4.879,this example involves two variables
467.36,4.72,namely users and time
469.759,4.081,therefore this is a two dimensional or
472.08,3.76,2d plot
473.84,3.919,take a look at the program that creates
475.84,4.16,a 2d plot
477.759,5.12,object web customers is a list on the
480.0,4.0,number of users and time hours indicates
482.879,3.121,the time
484.0,5.84,from this we understand that there are
486.0,7.199,123 customers on the website at 7 am
489.84,4.96,645 customers on the website at 8 am and
493.199,4.0,so on
494.8,4.48,the gg plot is used to set the grid
497.199,5.28,style and the plot method is used to
499.28,5.84,plot the website customers against time
502.479,4.641,don't forget to map plot library in line
505.12,4.079,to display or view the plot on the
507.12,4.639,jupiter notebook
509.199,5.2,the website traffic curve is plotted and
511.759,4.561,the graph is shown on the screen
514.399,4.241,it's also possible to change the line
516.32,4.959,style of the plot to change the line
518.64,5.92,style of the plot use define the line
521.279,5.601,style as dashed in the plot method
524.56,3.6,observe the output graph changes to a
526.88,3.44,dashed line
528.16,3.119,also note that the color is defined as
530.32,3.68,blue
531.279,4.881,using matplot library it's also possible
534.0,3.6,to set the desired axis to interpret the
536.16,4.32,required result
537.6,5.28,use the axis method to set the axis
540.48,6.359,in this example shown on the screen the
542.88,7.2,x-axis is set to range from 6.5 to
546.839,5.401,17.5 and the y-axis is set to range from
550.08,3.92,50 to 2000
552.24,4.08,let's now understand how to set the
554.0,4.08,transparency level of the line and to
556.32,3.68,annotate a plot
558.08,4.72,alpha is an attribute which controls the
560.0,5.44,transparency of the line lower the alpha
562.8,7.039,value more transparent the line
565.44,6.56,here the alpha value is defined as 0.4
569.839,3.361,the annotate method is used to annotate
572.0,3.36,the graph
573.2,3.6,the syntax for annotate method is shown
575.36,3.599,on the screen
576.8,4.719,the keyword max is the attribute that
578.959,5.681,denotes the annotation text
581.519,6.161,h a indicates the horizontal alignment
584.64,6.48,va indicates the vertical alignment
587.68,6.4,xy text indicates the text position and
591.12,5.12,x y indicates the arrow position
594.08,3.92,the keyword arrow props indicates the
596.24,4.08,properties of the arrow
598.0,4.72,in this example the arrow property is
600.32,5.04,defined as the green color
602.72,4.64,the output graph is shown on the screen
605.36,5.76,so far you've learned how to set line
607.36,7.039,width title x-axis and y-axis label
611.12,6.159,title of the plot legend line color and
614.399,5.201,annotate the graph for a single plot
617.279,4.881,the plot we created for website traffic
619.6,3.52,in the previous screens is for only one
622.16,2.96,day
623.12,4.64,let's now learn how to create multiple
625.12,3.68,plots say for three days using the same
627.76,3.519,example
628.8,4.56,the data set number of user for monday
631.279,4.881,tuesday and wednesday is defined with
633.36,4.8,respect to its time distribution
636.16,4.56,use different color and line width for
638.16,4.799,each day to distinguish the plot
640.72,5.119,in this example we have used red for
642.959,5.521,monday green for tuesday in blue for
645.839,5.521,wednesday the output graph is shown on
648.48,5.359,the screen a subplot is used to display
651.36,4.56,multiple plots in the same window
653.839,3.521,with a subplot you can arrange plots in
655.92,3.44,a regular grid
657.36,4.88,all you need to do is specify the number
659.36,5.039,of rows columns and plot
662.24,3.2,the syntax for subplot is shown on the
664.399,3.44,screen
665.44,5.04,it divides the current window into an m
667.839,5.601,by n grid and creates an axis for a
670.48,4.08,subplot in the position specified by p
673.44,5.04,for example
674.56,6.48,subplot 2 1 2 creates two subplots which
678.48,4.799,are stacked vertically on a grid
681.04,4.72,if you want to plot four graphs in one
683.279,5.12,window then the syntax used should be
685.76,4.8,subplot 2 1 4
688.399,4.241,layout and spacing adjustment are two
690.56,4.0,important factors to be considered while
692.64,5.52,creating subplots
694.56,6.56,use plt subplots adjust method with the
698.16,5.2,parameters h space and w space to adjust
701.12,5.6,the distances between the subplot and
703.36,3.36,move them around on the grid
707.92,5.12,in this demo you can see how to create
710.56,4.64,two subplots that will display side by
713.04,4.56,side in a single frame
715.2,4.639,two subplots stacked one on top of the
717.6,3.04,other or vertically split in a single
719.839,1.68,frame
720.64,3.12,and
721.519,4.56,four subplots displayed in a single
723.76,2.319,frame
727.12,5.12,first import matplotlib plot and style
738.8,6.839,type percentage matplotlib inline to
741.44,4.199,view the plot in jupiter notebook
746.88,4.48,define the parameters such as
748.56,6.32,temperature wind humidity precipitation
751.36,3.52,data and time data
755.2,4.639,you can see the data being typed here
764.16,4.96,next to create two subplots to be
766.48,6.799,displayed side by side in a given frame
769.12,7.36,for one two one and one two two
773.279,6.081,specify the figure size subplot space
776.48,5.84,title the color for time and temperature
779.36,6.2,data which is blue here and line style
782.32,3.24,and width
817.839,8.361,similarly specify the color for wind
820.56,5.64,which is red its line style and width
839.44,4.8,you can see the temperature and wind
841.44,5.199,subplot charts displayed side by side in
844.24,7.52,a given frame here
846.639,8.76,to create subplots 4 2 1 1 and 2 1 2
851.76,3.639,specify the parameters
868.959,4.32,this will create two subplots stacked
871.199,4.721,one on top of the other or vertically
873.279,5.12,split in a given frame
875.92,5.919,let's use humidity and precipitation
878.399,3.44,data to plot the graphs
883.12,7.8,specify the title color line style and
886.48,4.44,line width for both the graphs
917.36,4.56,you can see the two subplots stacked one
919.92,4.56,on top of the other with two different
921.92,5.68,colors indicating precipitation
924.48,5.52,and humidity here the two graphs are
927.6,2.4,separate
934.72,4.64,finally let's draw four subplots four
937.44,4.0,two two one
939.36,6.64,2 2 2
941.44,7.959,2 2 3 and 2 2 4 that will display in a
946.0,3.399,given frame
958.88,6.16,specify the title subplot data color
962.399,5.641,line style and line width for all four
965.04,3.0,subplots
1034.0,4.64,you can see the four subplots displayed
1036.319,4.801,in a single frame
1038.64,4.88,in this demo you learned how to create
1041.12,4.719,subplots displayed side by side
1043.52,4.88,vertically split subplots and four
1045.839,4.96,subplots displayed in a single frame
1048.4,4.56,using matplotlib
1050.799,4.321,you can create different types of plots
1052.96,5.599,using matplot library
1055.12,4.32,histogram scatter plot heat map pie
1058.559,2.401,chart
1059.44,3.119,error bar
1060.96,4.0,histograms
1062.559,5.281,histograms are graphical representations
1064.96,5.52,of a probability distribution in fact a

1070.48,5.76,using matplot library and its bar chart
1072.88,6.08,function you can create histogram charts
1076.24,4.88,a histogram chart has several advantages
1078.96,4.16,some of them are as follows
1081.12,3.84,it displays the number of values within
1083.12,4.16,a specified interval
1084.96,5.44,it's suitable for large data sets as
1087.28,4.88,they can be grouped within the intervals
1090.4,3.6,scatter plots
1092.16,3.44,a scatter plot is used to graphically
1094.0,2.96,display the relationship between
1095.6,3.6,variables
1096.96,4.8,a basic plot can be created using the
1099.2,4.96,plot method however if you need more
1101.76,4.56,control of a plot it's recommended that
1104.16,4.48,you use the scatter method provided by
1106.32,3.68,matplot library it has several
1108.64,2.96,advantages
