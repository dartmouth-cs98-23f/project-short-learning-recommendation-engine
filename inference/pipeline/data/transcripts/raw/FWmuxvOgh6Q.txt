0.0,3.6,hey guys how's it going so today i want
1.76,3.519,to share a few books with you that i
3.6,3.36,think will help you get better at data
5.279,3.28,structures and algorithms these books
6.96,3.759,are not only useful if you're trying to
8.559,2.96,learn data structures and algorithms for
10.719,2.96,your school
11.519,3.521,or your day-to-day work as a software
13.679,3.201,engineer but also with
15.04,16.8,technical interviews in mind so without
16.88,14.96,further ado let's begin
32.079,3.921,before you begin if you're new here i
34.079,2.801,make videos on software engineering
36.0,2.32,productivity
36.88,3.04,technical interviews and that kind of
38.32,2.8,stuff and if you're into similar things
39.92,2.959,please subscribe and hit the
41.12,3.04,notification bell icon so that you don't
42.879,2.881,miss any new videos
44.16,3.52,all right let's begin so the first book
45.76,4.319,i recommend is this little guy
47.68,4.719,called computer science distilled i came
50.079,2.96,across this book probably a year ago and
52.399,2.8,i think
53.039,4.321,it's an amazing book just to get your
55.199,3.2,head around all the topics that exist in
57.36,2.64,computer science
58.399,2.8,just by looking at the size of the book
60.0,2.64,you'll probably guess that this is
61.199,4.0,probably not an exhaustive
62.64,4.4,list or a detailed explanation of the
65.199,3.201,material but i think it's an amazing
67.04,3.04,starting point that will at least get
68.4,4.0,you familiar with the topics that
70.08,4.24,exist in the space it briefly touches
72.4,3.44,all the topics that you need to learn
74.32,2.88,in order to be good at data structures
75.84,2.88,and algorithms especially for your
77.2,3.2,technical interviews it's also very
78.72,3.92,light-hearted and has a good sense of
80.4,3.28,humor so it's not very dense to read so
82.64,2.64,even if you are just
83.68,3.04,a beginner software engineer or you just
85.28,3.12,started taking classes or you're
86.72,3.92,switching from a different field this is
88.4,3.52,a really nice and easy read to get
90.64,2.64,started so this book is pretty
91.92,4.239,interesting it covers
93.28,4.24,your basics like ideas logic counting
96.159,2.881,probability that you'll need as
97.52,4.4,foundations before even starting
99.04,4.16,algorithms it also has the introduction
101.92,3.36,to your big on notation
103.2,4.4,counting time and how things get slower
105.28,3.119,or faster as your data size increases
107.6,2.72,then it has
108.399,4.4,the strategy section that will cover
110.32,4.64,like iteration recursion backtracking
112.799,3.761,dynamic programming again i can't stress
114.96,3.68,enough that this is just
116.56,3.599,an introduction to all these topics i
118.64,3.2,mean some of these topics are huge like
120.159,3.28,dynamic programming and they cover that
121.84,3.68,in three pages like there's no way but
123.439,4.32,the goal of this book isn't to make you
125.52,3.92,an expert on any of this topic it's
127.759,4.321,basically to help you sort of
129.44,4.24,build the dictionary of topics in your
132.08,2.799,head let's look at an example of what i
133.68,3.12,mean right like there's a section here
134.879,3.521,that talks about hash table it says the
136.8,3.76,hash table is a data structure that
138.4,3.68,allows finding items in constant time
140.56,2.8,searching for an item takes constant
142.08,3.44,amount of time whether you're searching
143.36,3.84,among 10 million or just 10 items
145.52,3.68,okay you get the rough idea you don't
147.2,3.039,know in depth about what a hash table is
149.2,3.119,but it looks like
150.239,3.761,it is pretty efficient and it stores
152.319,3.681,things and you can retrieve them
154.0,3.519,in constant time by now if you've
156.0,2.959,followed this book you've probably read
157.519,2.881,the bigger notation so you kind of have
158.959,3.841,a rough idea about what
160.4,4.16,constant time means so that's cool
162.8,3.68,similarly to the array the hash
164.56,3.679,requires pre-allocating a big chunk of
166.48,3.759,sequential memory to store data
168.239,3.681,okay but unlike the array the items are
170.239,4.321,not stored in ordered sequence
171.92,3.76,the position of an item occupies is
174.56,3.52,magically given
175.68,4.639,by a hash function so this is what i
178.08,2.799,mean this book introduces the topic to
180.319,2.321,you but
180.879,4.08,there are some of the harder topic like
182.64,4.56,how the lookup is constant time or
184.959,3.28,how the hash table gives you such
187.2,3.36,performance
188.239,4.241,is sort of magic right it's not going to
190.56,3.28,explain you in depth how a hash table
192.48,3.36,works but i think it gives
193.84,3.2,a great introduction just one page so
195.84,3.36,that you kind of get
197.04,4.08,a very high level and basic
199.2,2.56,understanding of what a hash table is
201.12,2.399,and this is
201.76,3.199,very similar with everything else it's
203.519,3.28,like there's a section in graph we've
204.959,3.601,seen graphs are the flexible data
206.799,3.52,structure that use nodes and edges to
208.56,3.679,store information they're widely used to
210.319,4.721,represent data like social networks
212.239,4.56,nodes are people edges are friendship
215.04,4.24,relationships telephone networks
216.799,4.08,nodes are telephones and stations edges
219.28,3.44,are communications and much more
220.879,3.44,that's it and then the next topic goes
222.72,3.68,for searching in-depth searching
224.319,4.0,in graph via depth research we keep
226.4,3.68,following edges going deeper and deeper
228.319,3.28,and then they illustrate that via a nice
230.08,3.04,graph again to illustrate my point you
231.599,3.36,get the idea but you're not going to get
233.12,2.64,a full understanding final comment on
234.959,3.761,this book is
235.76,3.44,just the size itself it's so nice and
238.72,2.96,light
239.2,3.599,and compact easy to carry around then
241.68,1.839,you can literally throw it in your
242.799,2.241,backpack
243.519,3.44,especially if you're a student and when
245.04,3.36,you get your free time or break you just
246.959,3.28,pull it out read it or if you're
248.4,2.64,traveling probably not right now during
250.239,2.321,covet but
251.04,3.279,you know regular travel you can just
252.56,3.679,carry it with you you know just refresh
254.319,4.081,some topics you know it almost makes a
256.239,4.24,very serious topic like data structures
258.4,4.32,and algorithms kind of fun with little
260.479,3.761,colorful diagrams and just the size of
262.72,3.199,the book so highly recommend it
264.24,3.44,especially for beginners so once you've
265.919,2.081,graduated from that book you want to go
267.68,3.12,ahead and
268.0,3.28,get this book called rocking algorithms
270.8,3.52,this
271.28,6.16,book also follows a very similar pattern
274.32,5.28,of being very lighthearted funny lots of
277.44,4.64,diagrams to illustrate the point
279.6,3.68,but goes in more depth compared to that
282.08,3.36,book so once you've
283.28,4.32,read that book and you've sort of have a
285.44,3.759,vocabulary of words you've learned that
287.6,3.36,there's thing called hash tables that
289.199,3.121,exist you've learned that there's graphs
290.96,4.0,and how they represent
292.32,4.48,relationship between things and you can
294.96,3.679,search through them via depth
296.8,3.44,first or breadth first and you can do
298.639,2.961,certain algorithms on them but you have
300.24,2.72,no clue how to do them right like
301.6,3.2,that book doesn't give you any
302.96,2.64,algorithms like actual pseudo code or
304.8,3.839,any code
305.6,5.84,it's just an understanding and overview
308.639,4.081,this is very similar but it goes into a
311.44,3.039,little bit more detail
312.72,3.6,and then the table of contents for this
314.479,3.521,book is very similar you'll still get a
316.32,3.599,bigger analysis you'll still get the
318.0,3.919,sorting algorithms the basic data
319.919,3.761,structures greedy algorithms
321.919,3.761,searching dynamic programming that kind
323.68,3.519,of stuff but because you can see it's
325.68,3.6,thicker it's larger
327.199,3.681,it does go into more depth it's like if
329.28,3.6,that's level one this is gonna go level
330.88,3.599,two i'm gonna focus on the same example
332.88,3.039,for each of these books so you kind of
334.479,3.361,get how in-depth they go
335.919,3.921,so let's look at what this book has to
337.84,3.84,say about hash tables in the other book
339.84,3.6,you've learned that hash tables can give
341.68,4.959,you constant time lookups
343.44,5.28,and sort of how hash function
346.639,3.761,makes that happen is magic right in this
348.72,3.12,book however they talk about hash
350.4,2.639,functions what is a hash function how
351.84,2.96,does it store things
353.039,3.921,and then there are a bunch of examples
354.8,3.28,really nice and then it talks about like
356.96,3.76,time complexity
358.08,3.839,how a performance of hash table is not
360.72,3.28,guaranteed right like
361.919,3.12,if your hash function is bad or not
364.0,2.4,efficient then
365.039,2.72,you're not going to get a constant time
366.4,2.96,lookup and then at this point you're
367.759,3.361,like wait but the other book told me
369.36,2.959,that it sort of magically happens right
371.12,2.56,like it happens for
372.319,2.961,built-in hash functions and stuff but
373.68,2.88,now you want to understand what the
375.28,2.72,magic behind it is
376.56,3.44,this book's going to explain you that
378.0,4.24,and then it also talks about collisions
380.0,3.919,that's what happens when a hash function
382.24,3.12,tries to insert two different values to
383.919,2.241,the same spot that's when collision
385.36,2.8,happens
386.16,3.84,and then it sort of introduces that and
388.16,3.599,then it also talks about when the hash
390.0,3.6,function can resize and that's called
391.759,3.361,maintaining a load factor see look those
393.6,2.96,things you didn't know in that book but
395.12,1.919,now you're gonna understand in this book
396.56,3.12,right
397.039,4.561,and again let me re reiterate that this
399.68,2.32,is also a very light read it doesn't
401.6,3.039,have
402.0,3.919,any code it doesn't give you pseudo code
404.639,3.84,it just gives you very
405.919,4.961,illustrated examples and lots of graphs
408.479,5.601,and diagrams to show you
410.88,5.2,or to help you understand the idea even
414.08,4.239,better than that book so i think it's a
416.08,3.44,very natural progression to go from that
418.319,3.841,book to this book
419.52,3.519,and still till now you can go through
422.16,3.039,these books
423.039,3.761,without having much data structures and
425.199,2.241,algorithms experience you don't need
426.8,2.399,that much
427.44,3.36,so even if you are like in school and
429.199,2.481,you just started taking like the basic
430.8,3.28,classes
431.68,4.4,and you wanted to go a step ahead and
434.08,4.399,kind of like get started early
436.08,3.04,these are great books to get started or
438.479,2.241,if you're
439.12,2.88,into like mechanical engineering or
440.72,1.84,different sort of engineering you want
442.0,2.639,to get to
442.56,3.28,coding or you you're thinking about
444.639,2.96,prepping for a big
445.84,2.96,fan company interview like top tech
447.599,3.281,company interview and you don't know
448.8,3.76,what sort of topic you need to cover
450.88,3.12,these two books will sort of give you an
452.56,3.359,idea and you can gauge your
454.0,3.919,understanding you know these may come
455.919,4.56,very naturally to some people and
457.919,3.361,these books do help in that they don't
460.479,3.28,talk about it
461.28,4.88,in the technical jargon that most books
463.759,4.401,do and it's very natural and they give
466.16,3.92,real life examples so it's kind of help
468.16,4.159,you grasp the topic so i think
470.08,3.839,these are this is a great second book to
472.319,3.201,have and then once you've figured that
473.919,3.12,out maybe you've done your own research
475.52,2.48,you've gone online you've looked at it
477.039,3.121,in a little bit of
478.0,3.84,depth and you kind of wrote some code
480.16,3.439,you're you're in school and now you've
481.84,2.96,taken the data structures and algorithms
483.599,4.401,class that's when you
484.8,5.119,bring in the big boy and this is this is
488.0,3.52,a big one and it's it's almost like the
489.919,3.441,bible of algorithms book
491.52,3.44,it's called introduction to algorithms
493.36,4.399,this as everything again
494.96,4.48,those two books have same topic but in
497.759,4.16,this book you will see
499.44,3.28,much more technical detail it will cover
501.919,3.201,everything you left
502.72,3.52,pseudo code you love your mathematical
505.12,2.96,analyses and
506.24,4.239,everything you really need so let's look
508.08,4.24,at the same thing on this guy
510.479,4.24,all right in this case now we're talking
512.32,4.159,about time complexities to begin with
514.719,3.521,even in the first paragraph itself it
516.479,3.761,starts talking about collisions
518.24,3.279,but then it talks about how do you solve
520.24,3.279,collisions and there's a technique
521.519,3.76,called chaining it talks about that
523.519,3.521,it'll give you much everything is in
525.279,3.441,mathematical notation here
527.04,3.76,and there are theorems and proofs and
528.72,4.559,how you can get amortized
530.8,4.0,constant time or you know like uh upper
533.279,3.521,bound and a lower bound to your
534.8,3.92,time complexity is very mathematical at
536.8,4.24,this level if you're understanding
538.72,3.679,algorithms and if you've gotten this far
541.04,2.479,you're you're good to go
542.399,3.201,you know same with graphs
543.519,3.681,representations of a graph we can choose
545.6,2.4,between two standard ways to represent a
547.2,4.319,graph where
548.0,5.6,graph is a set of vertices and edges
551.519,4.401,as a collection of adjacency list as an
553.6,4.72,n or an adjacency matrix
555.92,4.32,either way applies to both directed and
558.32,3.92,undirected graph because the adjacency
560.24,2.88,list representation provides a compact
562.24,4.08,way to represent
563.12,5.04,sparse graph those where the edges are
566.32,2.4,much lesser than the vertices and
568.16,2.56,usually
568.72,3.119,that's the method of choice as you can
570.72,3.76,see it didn't
571.839,4.241,may take any effort to explain like how
574.48,3.919,oh graphs are like social networks
576.08,3.439,and telephone communications that kind
578.399,3.281,of stuff it's
579.519,3.76,going directly to the mathematical and
581.68,3.92,very uh technical
583.279,4.161,uh lingo here but if you have graduated
585.6,4.239,from those two books i think this is the
587.44,4.959,book that you eventually want to get to
589.839,4.0,because this will give you like the real
592.399,4.481,implementation details
593.839,4.881,and thorough understanding of
596.88,4.079,algorithms but i do want to add a note
598.72,3.679,here that you don't really need to know
600.959,3.44,everything in this book like some of it
602.399,3.601,is super mathematical you don't get
604.399,2.481,carried away by this and that's also the
606.0,3.04,reason that
606.88,3.199,i did not recommend this book as number
609.04,3.12,one because
610.079,3.521,if you've never really done data
612.16,2.0,structures and algorithms you're just
613.6,3.359,starting
614.16,3.84,and you take a look at things in this
616.959,3.041,book you will you'll
618.0,3.12,quit computer science i'll i'll promise
620.0,2.8,you that but
621.12,3.36,trust me once you once you go through
622.8,2.56,the other two books and you have a good
624.48,3.039,understanding of
625.36,3.84,what algorithms are and what sort of
627.519,2.0,things they do maybe like brush up on
629.2,2.4,some
629.519,3.841,math like both those book covers like
631.6,3.359,some discrete math and probability
633.36,3.68,counting that kind of stuff
634.959,3.841,you'll find this uh much more
637.04,3.2,approachable and then the final book i
638.8,4.4,had for you is this is
640.24,4.0,this ties very directly to technical
643.2,3.199,interviews not just
644.24,3.68,like learning as a software engineer
646.399,2.161,it's called elements of programming
647.92,2.64,interviews
648.56,3.2,um this is a great book mine is an older
650.56,3.6,edition i think it's like
651.76,3.92,eight or ten years old so it's in c plus
654.16,4.64,plus and you can get this
655.68,4.56,um in java and python these days so i'll
658.8,2.159,link both of those in the description
660.24,3.68,below
660.959,4.32,but this is a very technical interview
663.92,3.2,question first
665.279,3.12,approach compared to the other two books
667.12,4.0,so this is a great one
668.399,4.481,to either use side by side as you're
671.12,3.2,learning topics or maybe go through all
672.88,3.44,of them and once you feel comfortable
674.32,4.0,start kind of looking into this and the
676.32,3.6,chapters here are organized in a very
678.32,3.6,similar approach because like like i
679.92,3.68,said like the topics are same right like
681.92,4.08,so you'll talk about hash table it's
683.6,3.52,gonna give you a brief introduction of
686.0,3.44,what a hash table
687.12,4.8,is but after that it's just gonna go to
689.44,4.8,a problem right like for example
691.92,3.919,design a hash function for a chess game
694.24,3.2,to maintain the states your function
695.839,2.721,should take the state and the hash code
697.44,2.959,for the state and the move and
698.56,4.0,efficiently compute the hash code for
700.399,4.641,the updated state so this is like a real
702.56,4.88,practical implementation of hash code or
705.04,3.68,a usage of ash code right away right so
707.44,2.959,the other question is
708.72,3.44,let s be an array of strings write a
710.399,3.44,function that finds the closest pair of
712.16,3.359,equal entries so not only are you
713.839,2.321,learning the data structures but this
715.519,4.161,will actually
716.16,5.2,give you real life examples on
719.68,3.68,how you can use that data structure or
721.36,3.52,an algorithm to solve interview type
723.36,3.12,questions i know a lot of you guys also
724.88,4.079,have lead codes so maybe
726.48,3.52,lead code and this is unnecessary but if
728.959,3.921,you think of it lead code
730.0,3.519,is like 160 a year so that's more than
732.88,2.399,10 bucks
733.519,4.241,a month you know but this is going to be
735.279,3.201,a like 30 40 bucks and honestly like if
737.76,3.36,you can solve
738.48,4.0,almost all questions on this book you
741.12,3.279,don't need anything else like
742.48,3.919,this not only gives you thorough
744.399,3.281,explanations of how this works but it's
746.399,3.12,written from
747.68,3.76,engineering leaders from all of the big
749.519,2.721,companies you know so i highly recommend
751.44,2.8,this book
752.24,3.76,so those are the three uh four books
754.24,3.36,that i recommend for getting better at
756.0,4.24,data structures and algorithms
757.6,3.919,one final note that i wanted to add is i
760.24,4.8,do suggest that you
761.519,6.56,at least have an understanding of basic
765.04,4.72,constructs of programming and very
768.079,2.481,elementary data structures like what is
769.76,2.56,an array
770.56,3.839,what is a string what are primitive
772.32,4.88,types what is an int what is a float
774.399,4.641,how do you you know initialize variables
777.2,4.16,or how do you write an if else condition
779.04,4.0,how do you write a for loop while loop
781.36,3.12,that's it that's that if you know that
783.04,3.599,much then you'll start understanding
784.48,3.68,what these are but if you if not
786.639,3.121,maybe the first two books are still
788.16,3.919,approachable but
789.76,3.519,after that um you you'll get in trouble
792.079,4.401,but um
793.279,5.201,and for those um there are many free
796.48,3.599,resources online that you can learn
798.48,3.039,or if you're in school they're already
800.079,4.0,probably teaching you but
801.519,3.281,i will share a couple of other courses
804.079,2.961,that are
804.8,4.08,from uh really good universities and
807.04,3.68,they're free on youtube so you can kind
808.88,3.759,of watch those videos together
810.72,3.679,with these readings and that should help
812.639,2.401,you out a lot that's it if you have any
814.399,2.081,questions
815.04,3.039,write them in the comment below i'll try
816.48,3.599,to respond to each of them if you have a
818.079,4.0,question that pertains specifically to
820.079,3.921,you then reach out to me on instagram
822.079,2.241,and dm me and i try to respond to those
824.0,5.839,too
824.32,5.519,so until next time see ya bye
