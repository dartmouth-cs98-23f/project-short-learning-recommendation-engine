0.949,4.091,thank you very much fat yeah today I'm
3.51,3.69,going to talk about computer graphics
5.04,4.44,and visualization and basically it is an
7.2,5.13,area that evolved quite drastically and
9.48,4.949,nowadays we can computer generated or
12.33,3.99,generate on a computer photorealistic
14.429,4.381,imagery and even deal with very large
16.32,4.83,scale data sets this open up many
18.81,3.75,applications and various areas and this
21.15,2.61,is also why it's very exciting to work
22.56,3.12,in this field because there's so many
23.76,4.17,options on the table that are there to
25.68,4.23,explore in this sense I'm also very
27.93,4.259,happy to have a theme of different
29.91,4.98,people behind me that will follow me in
32.189,4.231,this endeavor at geo Delta at the
34.89,3.329,computer graphics and visualization
36.42,4.62,group which I'm heading we are four
38.219,5.071,faculty members in total 17 members 12
41.04,3.63,PhD students 20 master students many
43.29,3.12,other people that are involved in the
44.67,4.619,projects i'm showing here today so the
46.41,4.71,credit does not only go to me now what
49.289,4.261,do we do in this group well we have
51.12,4.86,basically four focus areas the first one
53.55,5.009,is named technology geometry processing
55.98,4.98,rendering techniques and medical or data
58.559,4.441,visualization so in order to give you a
60.96,3.87,glimpse of what these topics stand for I
63.0,3.9,prepared a couple of examples to show
64.83,3.719,you this little bit further game
66.9,3.69,technology is about automatically
68.549,3.781,generating content and this becomes more
70.59,3.87,and more important at nowadays because
72.33,4.469,we have procedurally generated worlds in
74.46,4.409,which players or even people are trained
76.799,3.721,and for that reason the content is not
78.869,3.151,that easy to produce anymore because
80.52,3.599,these worlds can be like gigantic
82.02,3.599,contain many many people that are
84.119,4.86,interacting with it and therefore
85.619,4.801,procedural methods are key here we also
88.979,3.93,developed an asst content design
90.42,4.44,interfaces that allows people to very
92.909,4.17,easily proceed you to generate content
94.86,4.11,but just a few scribbles and therefore
97.079,4.29,create entire 3d environments that can
98.97,4.079,then be explored these environments
101.369,3.75,there of course populated with geometry
103.049,6.18,and it is one of the other topics that
105.119,5.971,we're looking at in detail how do we
109.229,3.901,represent information how do we capture
111.09,3.959,information from our surrounding how we
113.13,4.23,transform that into a digital
115.049,5.191,representation that then people can
117.36,5.46,interact with here at the bottom you'll
120.24,5.43,also see an example of an animation and
122.82,4.5,deformation algorithm so we also look at
125.67,3.809,what are realistic deformations of
127.32,4.76,objects in order to make them really
129.479,4.761,reliable in the spiritual world
132.08,4.11,one key example here is of course also
134.24,3.27,how do I represent this information how
136.19,3.81,do I represent the data and the
137.51,5.16,information that is hidden in it in one
140.0,4.95,direction that we recently took is to
142.67,3.6,look at how we can represent for example
144.95,4.23,performance capture where you had
146.27,5.16,scanners that you could register this
149.18,4.98,virtual character here and then
151.43,4.59,basically decimate its information in
154.16,5.01,such a way that we only extract the most
156.02,5.07,valuable available information in other
159.17,4.65,words we can go ahead and then basically
161.09,5.01,transform a performance capture on the
163.82,3.93,left with all the details into something
166.1,3.36,that becomes more and more approximate
167.75,3.75,and the user can control this level of
169.46,3.749,detail automatically so the most
171.5,3.99,important movements are captured which
173.209,4.081,can then be used to query databases to
175.49,4.53,transfer the motion on to other
177.29,5.07,characters or to do another analysis
180.02,4.53,steps in such a way you have really a
182.36,4.2,system that allows you to then take any
184.55,4.32,kind of moving input and represented
186.56,4.73,with very few primitives that capture
188.87,5.16,the entire information of this sequence
191.29,5.199,now in these images you already see the
194.03,4.17,next topic that we of course address in
196.489,3.931,this group which is rendering techniques
198.2,3.96,ultimately you want to show something on
200.42,3.96,the screen which means that you have to
202.16,4.02,transform this kind of virtual object
204.38,4.29,into something that is displayable on
206.18,4.47,your device we're looking at realistic
208.67,4.05,rendering including shadows shading
210.65,4.2,global illumination non-photorealistic
212.72,5.04,rendering which is more for illustrative
214.85,4.859,purposes or to explain things better the
217.76,3.81,HD studies that show that with the right
219.709,4.441,abstraction you can increase
221.57,3.84,memorability as well as also reaction
224.15,3.0,time of the people that are interacting
225.41,3.18,with the data so it becomes very
227.15,3.809,important to look at this different
228.59,4.98,topic and automatically this links in
230.959,4.411,with perception how do we perceive the
233.57,4.41,images that we show how do we actually
235.37,5.07,perceive animations or even interactive
237.98,4.05,data evis trations and finally
240.44,3.78,computational photography how do we
242.03,4.2,integrate real-world data into our
244.22,3.42,approaches in order to make them more
246.23,3.99,accessible we can take this even further
247.64,4.319,with more photorealistic landscapes in
250.22,3.84,this case here you have even
251.959,5.461,participating media which is fog and
254.06,5.67,share it becomes very difficult to do on
257.42,4.77,because light interaction happens in the
259.73,4.32,entire scene and we need to compute all
262.19,3.72,of these values in real time this
264.05,3.69,becomes extremely important for example
265.91,4.23,if you want to train people in a driving
267.74,4.2,simulator or in plane simulator because
270.14,3.57,all of a sudden you need to integrate
271.94,3.39,all these weather effects in order to
273.71,3.36,make the simulation reduces little world
275.33,4.35,is represented well we heard this before
277.07,4.77,data is exploding with information
279.68,3.96,everywhere and dealing with large-scale
281.84,4.74,data sets is really a fundamental
283.64,5.82,challenge that we need to address we
286.58,4.89,look at topics like data analysis in
289.46,4.74,order to get new insights of this
291.47,4.98,information and produce representations
294.2,3.3,that people can explore extract the
296.45,3.87,knowledge that they're actually looking
297.5,7.02,for and then use the insides in their
300.32,7.77,own applications in this sense let me
304.52,5.7,show you a couple of different themes
308.09,4.56,related to our data and medical
310.22,4.86,visualization direction on large-scale
312.65,4.41,data display interaction methods visual
315.08,5.37,analytics and medical visualization I
317.06,5.64,think the key idea behind integrating
320.45,4.92,the user and visualization techniques in
322.7,4.95,big data is that if you look at a data
325.37,4.35,development and recently used you have
327.65,5.07,basically a development of compute power
329.72,5.49,and data that before well behaved quite
332.72,3.99,nicely right so we could basically deal
335.21,4.56,with the data sets that we add at hand
336.71,5.16,but this is about to change this means
339.77,3.51,that the processing and analysis that we
341.87,3.96,did before will not be sufficient
343.28,4.95,anymore these two curves cross and we
345.83,4.71,are basically out powered by the amount
348.23,4.5,of data that is coming in consequently
350.54,4.5,what we need is a new way to deal with
352.73,4.44,data which means that you need to
355.04,4.11,visualize it interact with and then
357.17,3.57,guide what kind of data to keep what
359.15,3.57,kind of data to involve in your
360.74,3.9,processes and that means that the user
362.72,4.38,has to be in the loop and we have visual
364.64,5.01,beings so visualization is one of the
367.1,5.64,key elements to have there to prove my
369.65,4.74,point you're a very simple example this
372.74,3.57,data set here if you look at it well
374.39,3.87,it's very different difficult to grasp
376.31,4.29,what is shown here but in fact it's just
378.26,3.66,an app with different temperature levels
380.6,3.21,and when I show you an image you
381.92,3.57,immediately grasp what is going on you
383.81,4.11,can see tendencies regions that are
385.49,3.93,conformed so you get much better in size
387.92,2.51,but this means that you need the right
389.42,2.93,tools and the right
390.43,5.22,solutions in order to make this really
392.35,5.31,happen one domain that specifically key
395.65,4.68,benefits from this is the medical domain
397.66,4.86,here you can see a large-scale medical
400.33,3.84,skin usually these are in your order or
402.52,3.66,a couple of gigabytes that are coming
404.17,3.15,out of those machines and now you need
406.18,4.17,to write technique in order to
407.32,5.1,illustrate the outcome here at the lower
410.35,3.54,left the video just shows an interaction
412.42,3.51,with such a data set where you for
413.89,3.78,example strip off the skin only look at
415.93,4.56,the bones look at different organs and
417.67,6.0,then really make decisions based on this
420.49,4.92,input because of its large and huge
423.67,3.99,amount of data we also looked at
425.41,5.34,compression techniques meaning how can
427.66,5.19,we actually reduce the retail level that
430.75,3.69,is given in such box of representations
432.85,4.29,for this tiny cube that has been
434.44,4.77,measured the GCU seen that looks like a
437.14,4.62,3d environment that you might have seen
439.21,5.13,from it that's a cheap video game but in
441.76,4.74,fact this is made up of tiny little data
444.34,4.35,cubes so we could also use the medical
446.5,4.26,data set of a resolution that goes up to
448.69,5.28,well I cannot pronounce the number and
450.76,5.97,that's one of the things about numbers
453.97,4.35,anymore but it's 2 to the power 51 boxes
456.73,4.19,that are represented here insect
458.32,5.34,together and there may be compressed to
460.92,4.96,do representation is only for gigabyte
463.66,5.34,large so it fits evening on interactive
465.88,4.29,graphics part where zooms also look in
469.0,2.58,the upper right corner that's the
470.17,2.94,resolution of the boxes that we are
471.58,3.75,dealing with you so it's really a
473.11,4.59,gigantic environment represented in a
475.33,4.89,very small amount of data and this
477.7,5.07,reduction of information is also crucial
480.22,4.05,when it comes to bandwidth and we have
482.77,3.51,to transport the information to the
484.27,4.41,graphics card or even to portable
486.28,4.77,devices as was pointed out by gemach
488.68,4.38,before and more and more things become
491.05,3.51,mobile and we are looking at how can we
493.06,3.66,deal with these large-scale data sets
494.56,3.93,everywhere now one of the directions
496.72,4.08,that we explore this for example
498.49,4.92,rendering where you basically can have
500.8,4.38,access two gigabytes of data on the fly
503.41,3.689,but just taking out your phone
505.18,4.049,connecting to the right server in an
507.099,3.841,interactivity you can see here in this
509.229,4.5,video also that several people can
510.94,5.339,interact at the same time the noise is
513.729,4.291,due to the calculation of the kind of
516.279,3.901,lighting that we use which in this case
518.02,3.87,also includes a lot of sampling
520.18,5.159,processes so don't get distracted by
521.89,5.25,their in the video but the nice thing is
525.339,3.661,that it basically if you have several
527.14,3.78,doctors discussing the same day as they
529.0,4.29,can interact they can do annotations one
530.92,4.02,of them can change the way that the data
533.29,3.84,is represented take off the ceiling
534.94,4.38,again discuss with the colleagues places
537.13,5.82,clipping plane and Alton can come to a
539.32,5.88,common conclusion now what I like other
542.95,4.62,areas that benefit from large-scale data
545.2,5.19,representations when the Netherlands one
547.57,5.82,of the that's the fears that exists of
550.39,5.31,course is fly that is always a big issue
553.39,4.319,and so people have covered the entire
555.7,5.4,Netherlands with planes that have
557.709,6.211,registered a height field of the entire
561.1,5.609,country and if highfield already
563.92,5.97,represents a terabyte of data and one of
566.709,4.62,the goals is to compute simulations in
569.89,3.509,this high field in order to predict what
571.329,3.931,kind of safety measures have to be put
573.399,5.31,into place in order to protect the
575.26,5.55,people H terabytes means 50 meters of
578.709,4.651,CDs slows reading huge amount of data
580.81,4.71,and if you want to integrate satellite
583.36,6.39,data for example in order to find out
585.52,7.379,something about 40 km i acquire year 1
589.75,5.43,point 5 petabytes of data and so it's a
592.899,5.911,huge amount a google earth already
595.18,6.36,contains 21 petabytes of data today that
598.81,4.62,is offered to you via disservice and now
601.54,4.68,producing computations on a global scale
603.43,4.44,like this is a big challenge you can
606.22,3.809,show you a little bit of what you will
607.87,3.84,also see in the class of how to produce
610.029,4.801,a rendering systems live nation
611.71,5.52,such gigantic data sets and information
614.83,4.98,on the tribe because we needed we fly
617.23,5.54,here from Delta baby over to rubble and
619.81,5.49,where will show you a quick application
622.77,5.2,that we built in the context of this
625.3,3.93,flood protection measurement one of the
627.97,2.84,things that people look at it for
629.23,4.83,example if you have a river like this
630.81,4.75,what happens if the water rises and so
634.06,3.72,you can place this inside of the
635.56,5.07,simulation and you can synthetic which
637.78,5.46,neighborhood where the water is flowing
640.63,4.08,what safety procedures to follow in
643.24,4.02,order to make sure that people get out
644.71,6.27,without a problem it turns out on a side
647.26,5.85,note it can actually in some areas mean
650.98,4.26,that if there is a real flooding you
653.11,4.05,should climb to the top of your roof top
655.24,4.35,because there's no way that you could
657.16,4.53,get over any three out of this area fast
659.59,4.47,enough and these kind of insights are
661.69,4.05,very available to decision-makers in
664.06,4.11,medical visualization it becomes a
665.74,4.2,little less clear what the right
668.17,4.62,recommendation and be two different
669.94,6.18,presentations pictures for example I
672.79,5.34,picked here a blood flow through this
676.12,4.23,straightened we have the release
678.13,6.06,scanners that are able to track what a
680.35,6.21,flow of blood is inside of your body but
684.19,5.22,they output these kind of images very
686.56,5.19,hard for anybody that is not a domain
689.41,3.78,expert so we also looked at Ellis
691.75,7.02,trations that are a little bit more
693.19,7.2,understandable like each one feeling for
698.77,5.11,of you where does the blood flow where
700.39,6.53,they went vortices what is the direction
703.88,5.34,and people that are using these kind of
706.92,5.82,illustrative already found very nice
709.22,5.68,finding that were previously unknown for
712.74,4.2,example about certain locations in the
714.9,4.29,heart and how they are turbulences that
716.94,4.56,are related to rings us to a kind of
719.19,5.04,loop what we want to do is we want to
721.5,4.83,have the visualization and interaction
724.23,4.14,with the user that can explore the data
726.33,4.8,and find what they're actually looking
728.37,4.74,for now this is not always
731.13,4.74,straightforward because this data
733.11,5.19,analysis that over here cannot be done
735.87,4.56,only when we want to support the human
738.3,4.29,in this task and this is one of the
740.43,4.2,research directions that includes visual
742.59,4.26,analytics which at the moment is one
744.63,6.84,other yeah let's say hot topic also in
746.85,7.23,the area so what does it base or what is
751.47,4.74,it based on well if we look at a high
754.08,4.56,dimensional data set like this one here
756.21,4.11,on the left you have the feeling okay it
758.64,4.5,is three-dimensional because all the
760.32,4.65,points and three dimensions but it turns
763.14,5.97,out that it's actually in this case a
764.97,6.93,folded piece of paper if you wonder so
769.11,5.85,the data actually lives not in 3d it
771.9,5.37,lives in 2d and if we can find out these
774.96,7.02,kind of relationships we can reduce the
777.27,7.62,dimensionality of available they mention
781.98,5.82,that is intrinsically encoded so let me
784.89,4.61,illustrate this with an example here is
787.8,5.19,a data set where people have written
789.5,5.23,numbers from 0 to 9 so everybody has a
792.99,4.35,different handwriting so they don't
794.73,8.07,match up but they collected 100 thousand
797.34,8.04,samples and now this represents 4096
802.8,4.26,dimensions sounds a bit weird but that
805.38,3.93,is the number of pixels that were used
807.06,4.14,to scan it every Bigfoot can change
809.31,4.92,color so that gives you four thousand
811.2,4.71,dimensions now what you can do is you
814.23,5.04,can analyze this data set and actually
815.91,6.619,embed it in a 2d representation what you
819.27,5.989,get is something like this
822.529,4.92,melody Judy where the goal was to
825.259,3.721,maintain as much as possible the
827.449,3.841,neighborhood relationships between
828.98,10.32,different objects meaning if they're
831.29,10.2,close now this is what it looks like and
839.3,4.079,interestingly when you select a cluster
841.49,4.649,like this one that is formed up here
843.379,5.46,well it actually corresponds to certain
846.139,4.62,elements in your data set so which means
848.839,5.75,that this similarity can come out and
850.759,5.88,become visually observable to the user
854.589,3.61,unfortunately that is the downside well
856.639,2.94,you can do this for all the numbers and
858.199,3.781,look something like this and previous
859.579,4.141,approaches have worked in the order of
861.98,4.14,minutes for larger data sets in the
863.72,4.979,order of hours which is very often
866.12,4.68,unacceptable and undesirable so looking
868.699,6.031,at like seller ation techniques like we
870.8,6.449,did allows you to go down to timing we
874.73,4.609,get similar results of these types of
877.249,4.981,embeddings that allowed the interactions
879.339,6.881,without having to wait for it for a long
882.23,6.209,time now furthermore when you look at
886.22,11.58,data like this you see okay similar
888.439,11.34,information but you don't get a overview
897.8,3.69,of what number is might be linked of
899.779,4.261,what things might be very similar is
901.49,4.469,seven looks a lot like a one is there a
904.04,4.38,way to abstract is even further and
905.959,5.161,create groups that are meaningfully
908.42,4.74,connected so this is also direction as
911.12,4.35,we looked into of how to create her
913.16,3.81,ocular representations and for this I
915.47,6.75,will change the example because it's a
916.97,7.26,little bit better to feel where settle
922.22,5.19,as it's like different spectral
924.23,5.459,responses of the ground and we analyze
927.41,4.849,these data sets to then define is
929.689,2.57,embedding
932.94,5.38,point spread out here not also high
936.7,3.27,dimensional corresponding to different
938.32,4.26,spectral bands that have been covered
939.97,6.36,and then the user can select certain
942.58,5.61,groups that then reflect properties this
946.33,3.6,is not something we put in it is
948.19,3.78,something that came out of the embedding
949.93,3.36,in other words if you select the other
951.97,4.23,clusters that you see there in this
953.29,4.56,image it represents clouds ocean because
956.2,3.9,on a high level while the ground is
957.85,5.07,ground the clouds are clouds and the sea
960.1,4.41,you see now if you take only the
962.92,4.14,mainland you can do the same event
964.51,5.52,embedding again and you see desert areas
967.06,4.74,form mountains urban areas and for this
970.03,3.96,particular case if you continue with the
971.8,4.14,desert areas you find dry legs and a
973.99,4.32,particular one off the dry lights that
975.94,4.23,is the largest one also sticks out so
978.31,3.6,you can see how you can dive into the
980.17,3.42,data representation and find what you're
981.91,6.9,actually looking for it would have been
983.59,7.53,impossible to find this driving just
988.81,4.29,tiny in comparison to all the other
991.12,3.78,information it is there but if you know
993.1,4.44,what you're looking for these kind of
994.9,6.03,systems allow you to find the
997.54,4.89,information you need now finding
1000.93,3.83,information also means the user is
1002.43,5.58,integrated in this process so if we also
1004.76,5.56,looked extensively at tools that would
1008.01,4.89,allow you to interact with a computer
1010.32,5.82,that you can see for example gesture
1012.9,6.24,control that is to modify a 3d object
1016.14,4.98,here in this case in particular this
1019.14,3.81,application is funny because seeing that
1021.12,3.93,you don't touch anything with your hands
1022.95,4.8,it also means that a surgeon with in
1025.05,4.95,surgery can stay Sarah they can actually
1027.75,7.22,interact with medical data set without
1030.0,4.97,contaminating themselves if you
1035.99,5.049,construction simplification animation
1038.579,4.26,there's data display large-scale
1041.039,3.75,realistic rendering illustrative
1042.839,3.691,rendering perceptual methods also new
1044.789,4.02,display technology and data
1046.53,4.47,visualization and interaction which is
1048.809,5.161,the main specific visualization visual
1051.0,5.97,analytics and interaction methods so the
1053.97,5.28,course is afternoon we're going to cover
1056.97,3.6,many of these different directions I'm
1059.25,3.299,going to give you insights and how they
1060.57,3.69,actually work so that you can then pick
1062.549,4.051,up the information that you might need
1064.26,4.11,for your own projects and then also get
1066.6,5.85,in touch with us if you are further
1068.37,6.77,interested this thank you very much get
1072.45,2.69,there no question
