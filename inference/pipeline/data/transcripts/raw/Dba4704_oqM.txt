0.03,7.68,in this video we're going to look at
2.46,9.0,HTML HTML stands for hypertext markup
7.71,7.2,language HTML is the programming
11.46,6.48,language used to develop websites before
14.91,5.93,we look at some HTML basics it's
17.94,8.329,important you know what we mean by
20.84,7.66,structure and presentation with HTML
26.269,4.121,every website should be designed with
28.5,4.489,consideration of structure and
30.39,5.34,presentation but what's the difference
32.989,5.111,the structure refers to the actual
35.73,4.8,content on the website whereas the
38.1,5.16,presentation prefers the layout and
40.53,4.47,style of the website the release is
43.26,3.66,important to know the difference is we
45.0,4.77,actually use a different language for
46.92,5.22,each we create the structure using HTML
49.77,4.8,but we create the presentation using the
52.14,5.099,language called CSS the best way of
54.57,5.19,looking at it is the HTML code shows the
57.239,7.651,content for the CSS controls how the
59.76,6.51,content is presented here is an example
64.89,3.9,of CSS code
66.27,5.79,remember this puts nothing on our
68.79,6.0,website but once we write HTML code the
72.06,5.129,CSS code will determine what that text
74.79,5.85,will look like when displayed in your
77.189,7.351,browser in this code we were actually
80.64,6.6,describing different sections of text H
84.54,4.86,refers to the header just take a look at
87.24,5.669,leaves one by one so here's what header
89.4,6.719,1 looks like or h1 you can see it uses
92.909,7.201,the Arial font is also centered and has
96.119,6.75,two font size 32 next we have had a 3
100.11,5.49,more page 3 this uses a font from the
102.869,5.25,seventh family which the collection of
105.6,7.1,fonts included Times New Roman courier
108.119,8.521,and more it also uses font size 16
112.7,7.059,finally we have the P code which is for
116.64,5.7,paragraph this is what our main text
119.759,4.68,will look like on the web page we have
122.34,4.42,chosen to use a font from the sans-serif
124.439,5.741,family and there's the list of
126.76,5.61,cellphones we've justified our text but
130.18,5.3,you can't really see here it's only one
132.37,6.27,word and we're using the font size 12
135.48,5.62,well then you'll notice the texts are
138.64,4.41,all different colors that's because
141.1,4.83,we've set them two different colors in
143.05,6.27,our CSS code the colors are represented
145.93,6.17,using hex but we'll look at that in more
149.32,7.23,detail some other time
152.1,7.0,let's now see some HTML code also just
156.55,5.19,when we do load HTML code you'll notice
159.1,5.07,the text examples I've got there they're
161.74,3.66,all about the same size I didn't want to
164.17,6.72,change the science just to make sure it
165.4,9.51,was easier to read yeah kind of so HTML
170.89,6.75,code what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
174.91,5.82,break down the code but we're gonna
177.64,7.5,break it down not line by line but tag
180.73,7.2,by tag okay let's start off with HTML
185.14,6.36,this is known as the root element and it
187.93,7.71,makes a clearly using HTML what do you
191.5,8.16,notice other tags is data or text is
195.64,6.03,thought in between the tags the start
199.66,5.01,and the end of the tag is recognized
201.67,4.56,because the ending tag has that forward
204.67,6.03,slash and the start of it
206.23,7.229,okay next we've got the head tag this is
210.7,4.56,known as a document head and it's used
213.459,5.191,to contain information about the file
215.26,6.06,you can see in our example the head tag
218.65,6.32,actually contains information about the
221.32,9.72,CSS code that we saw on the previous
224.97,8.769,screen next you've got the body tag the
231.04,8.33,body tag contains all the content for
233.739,9.991,the page and finally you already seen
239.37,8.35,h1h BMP in CSS well we also put them
243.73,6.509,here as tags these are section tags
247.72,4.44,header one has a clear and paragraph you
250.239,3.411,can have a range of different types of
252.16,4.52,headers if they had a warrant
253.65,5.579,to do it a 3 and a 4 and a 5 etc the way
256.68,5.279,these different sections were looked I
259.229,11.28,actually defined in the CSS file as I've
261.959,13.201,already seen alright so here is our HTML
270.509,8.25,code you can see here is a line for the
275.16,6.66,CSS and over here is the actual content
278.759,6.451,on the internal code now we will see on
281.82,6.18,the right that is the content being
285.21,6.87,displayed but I was if we were to ignore
288.0,6.21,any CSS code okay now if we consider the
292.08,5.43,CSS code in that line above because the
294.21,5.25,referencing up there you will see the
297.51,4.409,difference it would now make the code
299.46,6.929,those exact same text but now it
301.919,11.521,actually has its formal layout based on
306.389,9.75,that stuff in the code and there is the
313.44,5.49,CSS code in case you want to just have a
316.139,6.271,quick look to see how it ends up the way
318.93,9.39,it did feel free to pause the video here
322.41,11.43,to make some notes alright and that's
328.32,9.92,everything you need to know about HTML
333.84,4.4,and it gets a bit of CSS as well
