0.48,4.08,hello everyone my name is dr clayton
2.48,4.16,miller i'm an assistant professor at the
4.56,4.16,national university of singapore in the
6.64,3.68,school of design and environment i'm
8.72,3.68,here to motivate you to take part in
10.32,3.84,this edx course introduction to data
12.4,3.68,science for the built environment
14.16,3.6,i'm on a mission to teach modern data
16.08,3.68,science skills to professionals in the
17.76,3.76,building and construction industry
19.76,3.759,we have a huge amount of data being
21.52,4.32,generated in this field and my goal is
23.519,4.0,to help reduce the fear someone gets in
25.84,3.199,the face of large messy data from
27.519,3.121,buildings
29.039,3.601,throughout this course i will cover a
30.64,3.919,few different areas of data science as
32.64,3.84,applied to the built environment the
34.559,3.52,first goal is to introduce the python
36.48,3.44,programming language and some of its
38.079,2.961,add-on packages for data science in
39.92,2.56,general
41.04,3.039,next i'll show you how to use those
42.48,3.599,skills in the different phases of the
44.079,3.921,built environment i'll cover their
46.079,3.761,application to design construction and
48.0,3.44,operations of buildings
49.84,3.44,through these steps we will be using
51.44,4.24,real world data and will discuss
53.28,6.439,practical applications i hope you stick
55.68,4.039,around and join us in this process
