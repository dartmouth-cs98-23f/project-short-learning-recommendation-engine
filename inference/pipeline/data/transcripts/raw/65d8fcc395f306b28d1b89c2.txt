Hello everybody, in this video you will learn the 
meaning of the phrases Artificial Intelligence  
Machine Learning, Deep 
Learning and Computer Vision   
We will learn how they are related and
how they are different
Dr. John McCarthy coined the phrase Artificial 
Intelligence in a proposal published  
on august 31st 1955. That's a long time 
back Artificial Intelligence is the idea  
of making machines think and learn like humans. It 
does not tell us how to do it, it is just the idea
Early AI techniques were rule-based  
they were called Expert Systems 
and they were nothing more than
a series of if this do that rules. If you 
find this do something, if you find that do  
something else soon the number of rules became 
overwhelming for even moderately complex tasks  
it was very difficult to put these rules together 
so researchers started asking what if the machines  
could learn by looking at data instead of 
trying to be programmed explicitly with rules  
this idea of machines learning from 
data is called Machine Learning 
there are many different 
Machine Learning algorithms  
and some of them are based on Neural Networks
early Neural Networks contained 
three layers an input layer  
for receiving input an output 
layer and a third hidden layer
these Neural Networks could solve simple 
problems but the media and some overly  
optimistic researchers hyped up their capabilities 
so obviously these networks did not live up to  
their lofty expectations and there was a lot of 
disappointment and neural networks became a dirty  
word in AI however people working in the field 
were making good progress they discovered that  
they could get fantastic results if they train 
neural networks with many hidden layers and this  
architecture was called Deep Neural Networks the 
"Deep" stands for the many hidden layers in the  
network but Neural Networks had become uncool they 
were very unpopular and so it needed rebranding  
in 2006 Dr. Geoffrey Hinton coined the 
phrase Deep Learning now that is cool so Deep  
Learning is a subset of machine learning where 
problems are solved using Deep Neural Networks  
now what's Computer Vision roughly speaking it 
is the field of research and development that  
helps computers see Computer Vision deals with 
interpreting visual data like images and videos  
these images could be from different sources like 
a regular Camera a Depth Camera a Thermal Camera  
an Electron Microscope or an X-Ray Machine 
a Radio Telescope and many more within  
Computer Vision we solved many problems like Face 
Recognition Image Classification Object Detection  
Text detection and Recognition 3D Reconstruction 
of scenes photographing a Black Hole  
yeah that too so Computer Vision is not a subset 
of Artificial Intelligence but they have a huge  
overlap many problems in Computer Vision 
are solved using Machine Learning including  
Deep Learning but many other problems are solved 
without any AI techniques for example creating a  
panorama is part of Computer Vision but it usually 
does not involve any AI the same is true about 3D  
Reconstruction Algorithms so now let's summarize 
what we have learned Artificial Intelligence or  
AI is the Science and Engineering of making 
machines learn think and act like humans  
Machine Learning is a subset of AI where 
machines learn directly from data instead  
of hand-coded rules Deep Learning is a sub-field 
of Machine Learning where machines learn using  
Deep Neural Networks and finally Computer Vision 
is the Science and Engineering of interpreting  
visual data many Computer Vision problems 
are solved using AI but many others are not
