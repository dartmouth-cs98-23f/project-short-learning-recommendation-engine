75.299,4.86,dream so let's start with what is data
78.78,3.479,science data science is an
80.159,4.621,interdisciplinary field that utilizes
82.259,5.04,computational and statistical methods to
84.78,4.86,extract insights from data its
87.299,3.96,applications are widespread ranging from
89.64,3.78,predicting consumer Behavior to
91.259,4.32,developing new Medical Treatments with
93.42,4.019,the explosive growth of Big Data data
95.579,4.441,science has emerged as one of the most
97.439,5.341,exciting and rapidly evolving fields of
100.02,4.559,the 21st century web development on the
102.78,3.24,other hand involves building and
104.579,3.72,maintaining websites and web
106.02,4.2,applications its activities include
108.299,4.261,front-end development back-end
110.22,4.38,development server Administration and
112.56,4.199,database management with the internet
114.6,4.5,being a crucial part of our daily lives
116.759,4.441,web development has become highly sought
119.1,3.9,after skill in the tech industry due to
121.2,4.32,to the ever increasing demand for
123.0,4.56,Innovative and engaging web experiences
125.52,4.379,talking about the future scope of both
127.56,4.14,the Technologies can help you enter the
129.899,3.961,right field data science applications
131.7,4.2,involve using statistical and machine
133.86,4.2,learning techniques to gain insights
135.9,5.22,from data and make predictions or
138.06,4.56,decisions based on those insights some
141.12,4.199,of the key Fields where data science
142.62,4.979,plays a vital role are artificial
145.319,4.261,intelligence and machine learning the
147.599,4.14,development and application of AI and
149.58,4.32,machine learning algorithms which allow
151.739,4.441,intelligent systems to learn from data
153.9,5.339,and make judgments will greatly benefit
156.18,4.98,from data science internet of things as
159.239,4.321,the quantity and complexity of iot
161.16,4.859,devices increase data science will
163.56,4.92,assist businesses in making sense of the
166.019,4.681,massive volumes of data these devices
168.48,4.56,generate enabling them to streamline
170.7,4.86,operations and provide better goods and
173.04,4.62,service Healthcare organizations in the
175.56,4.98,industry will be able to analyze patient
177.66,5.4,data spot Trends and patterns and create
180.54,4.74,individualized treatment programs with
183.06,4.8,the aid of data science in other words
185.28,5.039,we can say that wherever a huge amount
187.86,4.799,of data is available data science is
190.319,4.801,important in that particular field
192.659,4.141,so are these applications enough to
195.12,4.92,choose data science as your future
196.8,5.46,career if not then the salaries of data
200.04,3.96,scientists might Amaze you although
202.26,3.72,there are several job roles present in
204.0,4.14,the field of data science like data
205.98,5.28,scientists data analysts data Engineers
208.14,5.22,business analysts and many but something
211.26,4.14,that will Amaze you is according to
213.36,4.86,glassdo the national average salary of a
215.4,4.86,data scientist is 12 lakhs per year in
218.22,3.96,India with additional cash benefits
220.26,4.08,depending on the companies hiring you
222.18,4.5,the average salary of the same data
