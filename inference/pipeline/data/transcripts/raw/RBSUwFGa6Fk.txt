0.08,3.04,let's talk about data science and some
1.76,3.2,of the other related terms you may have
3.12,3.279,heard such as predictive analytics
4.96,3.679,machine learning
6.399,3.681,advanced analytics and others
8.639,3.281,so let's start with the textbook
10.08,4.08,definition of data science
11.92,6.4,so data science is the field of study
14.16,6.24,that that involves extracting
18.32,3.039,knowledge
20.4,3.52,and
21.359,2.561,insights
24.32,3.6,from
26.56,4.36,noisy
27.92,3.0,data
31.199,4.081,and then turning those insights
33.6,3.36,into
35.28,4.08,actions
36.96,3.759,that our business or organization can
39.36,3.359,take
40.719,4.561,okay so let's dig into it a little bit
42.719,5.041,more and discuss what are the different
45.28,4.56,areas that are covered by data science
47.76,3.84,so really data science is the
49.84,3.199,intersection between three different
51.6,3.76,disciplines
53.039,4.961,we start with
55.36,4.24,computer science
58.0,4.559,then
59.6,6.72,we also cover
62.559,5.441,the area of mathematics
66.32,4.159,and then what i think is the most
68.0,2.479,important
70.84,3.4,is business
74.64,4.24,expertise
77.36,4.399,so the intersection of these three
78.88,4.559,disciplines is data science
81.759,4.0,and true data science initiatives
83.439,5.281,involve collaboration across all these
85.759,2.961,three different areas
89.119,4.481,okay so now let's touch on the different
91.36,4.24,types of data science that you can do
93.6,3.76,now what we need to understand here is
95.6,3.04,that we have different data science
97.36,2.96,methods
98.64,3.519,for different questions that we might
100.32,4.079,ask in an organization
102.159,4.561,and these questions can vary by
104.399,6.801,complexity and the value that we get out
106.72,4.48,of them so let's chart them here
112.84,4.2,by complexity
115.759,3.841,and
117.04,2.56,value
120.24,4.08,okay so the first one that we have here
122.479,4.32,is
124.32,4.639,descriptive
126.799,4.24,analytics
128.959,4.161,so this is really about what is
131.039,4.081,happening in my business right and it
133.12,3.199,involves having accurate data collection
135.12,3.44,to make sure that we know what's
136.319,3.521,happening so a a good question we could
138.56,4.16,ask here is
139.84,6.399,well did sales go up or down
142.72,3.519,the next level is
146.72,4.48,diagnostic
148.56,2.64,analytics
151.599,5.041,and this is more about why did something
154.08,4.48,happen so why did sales go up or down
156.64,3.84,and it involves
158.56,4.0,drilling down to the root cause of our
160.48,6.24,problem
162.56,4.16,now the next one that we have is
167.519,2.881,predictive
168.84,3.72,analytics
170.4,3.52,so this is about what is likely to
172.56,3.6,happen next
173.92,4.16,right so what will our sales performance
176.16,3.359,be next quarter
178.08,3.76,and it involves using historical
179.519,5.841,patterns in our uh in our data to
181.84,5.52,predict outcomes in the future
185.36,4.48,and then finally
187.36,3.92,we have
189.84,4.08,prescriptive
191.28,2.64,analytics
194.64,4.48,so this is about what do i need to do
196.48,5.039,next what is the recommended best action
199.12,4.479,for a particular outcome so question we
201.519,4.241,could ask here is what do i need to do
203.599,3.521,to improve sales by 10
205.76,2.24,right
207.12,2.8,okay
208.0,5.2,so now we can talk about how data
209.92,6.08,science is done and who actually does it
213.2,5.759,so let's look at the data science life
216.0,6.56,cycle and the first thing that we always
218.959,6.081,must start with is
222.56,2.48,business
225.36,2.799,understanding
229.76,4.16,so this is really critical to make sure
231.92,5.28,that we're asking the right question
233.92,4.48,before we go down a lengthy data science
237.2,3.2,initiative
238.4,3.68,and this is where you can see the having
240.4,2.96,the business expertise and the domain
242.08,3.04,expertise
243.36,4.32,can be incredibly critical to make sure
245.12,5.119,that we're asking the right questions
247.68,5.52,okay so once we've defined that
250.239,6.321,we can move on to
253.2,3.36,data mining
256.959,3.68,so this is this is the process of
258.959,3.68,actually going out into our data
260.639,3.601,landscape and procuring the data that we
262.639,4.0,need for our analysis
264.24,5.6,so once we've done that
266.639,3.201,we can move on to
269.919,3.601,data
271.04,2.48,cleaning
274.16,3.52,so
274.96,3.6,the the reality of the marketplace is
277.68,3.519,that
278.56,4.639,once we when we find data it's probably
281.199,4.881,not in the best format that we need it
283.199,5.44,in and it probably has uh some some
286.08,4.64,issues with it right it might have rows
288.639,3.761,that have missing values it might have
290.72,3.36,duplicates in it so there's some
292.4,4.32,preparation and cleaning that we have to
294.08,6.24,do before it's ready for our analysis
296.72,6.88,so once we've done that cleansing
300.32,3.28,we can move on to
303.84,2.88,exploration
308.88,4.24,okay so this is the part of the process
311.52,3.76,that allows us to use different
313.12,3.68,analytical tools that can start helping
315.28,2.88,us answer some of
316.8,3.44,the the types of questions that i
318.16,4.319,mentioned here earlier
320.24,3.84,and if we actually want to get into some
322.479,3.521,of these higher value questions like
324.08,4.08,predictive and prescriptive
326.0,4.32,then we must start using advanced
328.16,4.4,analytical tools such as
330.32,3.84,machine learning tools
332.56,3.52,that leverage massive amounts of
334.16,4.16,computing power and massive amounts of
336.08,4.24,high quality data
338.32,4.8,to make predictions and prescribe
340.32,5.12,actions for the future
343.12,4.079,now once we've done our exploration and
345.44,3.36,perhaps our advanced
347.199,3.921,analytics
348.8,5.04,what do we do next well we need to
351.12,2.72,visualize
354.32,4.48,our insights and outcomes of our
356.56,3.12,analysis
358.8,3.04,okay
359.68,3.04,now i want to quickly touch on who does
361.84,2.56,what
362.72,4.0,in this life cycle
364.4,3.519,so in an organization you may have roles
366.72,3.28,like
367.919,3.601,a business analyst
370.0,3.6,you might have
371.52,3.92,data engineers
373.6,4.719,and then you might have
375.44,3.599,data scientists
378.319,2.481,so
379.039,4.081,business analysts
380.8,4.0,are obviously involved in formulating
383.12,3.199,the questions they have the domain
384.8,3.839,expertise they can help with the
386.319,4.241,business understanding but they're also
388.639,4.481,involved with
390.56,4.96,visualizing our insights in a way that's
393.12,3.6,useful for the business right
395.52,3.2,and then we have folks like data
396.72,5.36,engineering folks so these are the
398.72,5.44,people that can help us find the data
402.08,3.44,clean the data
404.16,4.0,and then also help with some of the
405.52,5.28,exploration
408.16,4.24,we move on to our data scientists so
410.8,3.6,these are the people that will really
412.4,4.0,help us with the exploration they'll
414.4,3.519,help us with the advanced machine
416.4,3.359,learning techniques
417.919,3.68,and they'll also assist in the
419.759,3.761,visualization
421.599,4.16,so you can see there's there's some
423.52,3.6,overlap between the roles and that's why
425.759,3.44,it's critical
427.12,3.199,to have collaboration
429.199,2.641,across
430.319,3.6,these roles
431.84,4.24,and what you also start seeing nowadays
433.919,3.68,in the marketplace is that sometimes
436.08,3.04,business analysts have to do some
437.599,2.88,machine learning they have to help out
439.12,3.44,with exploration
440.479,4.321,data scientists sometimes need to go and
442.56,4.16,find the data on their own so there's a
444.8,3.36,lot of overlap and
446.72,4.0,these different roles must collaborate
448.16,4.8,with each other
450.72,4.8,okay so i hope you can see now how the
452.96,4.799,data science life cycle can help us take
455.52,3.679,noisy data turn it into knowledge and
457.759,4.0,insights and then turn it into
459.199,3.921,meaningful action for our business
