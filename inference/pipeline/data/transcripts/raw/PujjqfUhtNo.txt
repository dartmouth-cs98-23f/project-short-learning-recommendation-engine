6.16,3.68,hello everyone
7.759,3.521,welcome back to this wonderful journey
9.84,4.24,of computer organization
11.28,4.479,and architecture in this session we will
14.08,4.72,be focusing on memory
15.759,3.841,so let's get to learning wikipedia
18.8,3.44,states
19.6,3.439,memory is the faculty of brain by which
22.24,3.76,data or
23.039,3.681,information is encoded stored and
26.0,3.279,retrieved
26.72,3.6,when needed similarly in case of
29.279,3.201,computers
30.32,4.64,memory which was initially termed as
32.48,5.84,store plays a similar role
34.96,5.84,everything be it an image an audio file
38.32,3.04,a text file or instructions for a key
40.8,2.88,press
41.36,3.92,or a mouse click if that is stored in
43.68,5.039,the computer memory
45.28,6.56,it's actually encoded as bits basically
48.719,3.761,each memory cell can have either zero or
51.84,3.84,one
52.48,3.44,and all these are comprised of millions
55.68,3.12,of
55.92,4.319,bits and processed by the processor the
58.8,3.84,brain of the computer
60.239,3.92,so we might think that having a single
62.64,4.0,large memory unit
64.159,3.201,is the solution to the situation but i'm
66.64,3.2,afraid
67.36,3.2,it's not with the increasing size of the
69.84,3.68,memory
70.56,3.28,the time to access them gets increased
73.52,3.12,and
73.84,4.0,time is the essence here let me put it
76.64,3.519,to you this way
77.84,4.48,we know the processor is very fast i
80.159,3.921,mean today we have gigahertz processors
82.32,4.08,even in our smartphones
84.08,3.28,suppose we have 2 gigahertz processor
86.4,4.0,this means
87.36,3.36,the frequency is 2 gigahertz hence time
90.4,3.92,is
90.72,4.8,1 upon frequency that is 1 by 2 into 10
94.32,3.68,to the power 9.
95.52,3.52,now how did i get this 10 to the power 9
98.0,4.64,let's have a chart
99.04,7.28,shall we we know one kilo unit equals to
102.64,6.72,1000 units hence 10 cube units
106.32,4.079,therefore one mega unit is 1 000 kilo
109.36,4.24,units and thus
110.399,3.68,10 to the power 6 units and finally 1
113.6,3.76,giga
114.079,4.72,units is 1 000 mega units and thus 10 to
117.36,3.039,the power 9 units
118.799,4.241,now coming back to our initial
120.399,3.281,illustration 1 upon 2 into 10 to the
123.04,4.16,power 9
123.68,5.12,seconds equals to 1 by 2 into 10 to the
127.2,4.32,power minus 9 seconds
128.8,3.84,and 10 to the power minus 9 seconds is 1
131.52,3.92,nanosecond
132.64,5.2,therefore in half a nanosecond our
135.44,5.6,processor can perform a single task
137.84,6.24,so to conclude the cpu is fast not
141.04,4.16,only fast real fast and keeping up with
144.08,4.159,this kind of speed
145.2,5.039,is tough because if our memory device is
148.239,4.0,way slower than the cpu
150.239,4.161,then the cpu will remain idle for the
152.239,5.201,most of the time and we won't have an
154.4,3.839,efficient machine also not only the
157.44,4.079,speed
158.239,5.761,the size and the cost are considered to
161.519,4.481,when it comes to memory that's why we
164.0,4.84,have various memory devices
166.0,5.28,associated to our computer computer
168.84,4.039,designers termed the memory to perform
171.28,4.16,immediate tasks as
172.879,4.881,primary memory and the memory which is
175.44,4.799,used as a more permanent storage
177.76,5.36,is known as secondary memory when we
180.239,5.841,play an audio file our system manager
183.12,5.36,that is the operating system manages the
186.08,5.2,space within the primary memory
188.48,4.96,to perform the instructions which is
191.28,4.64,understanding the mouse click
193.44,3.76,opening up the default application for
195.92,3.52,playing the file
197.2,4.88,after bringing it from the secondary
199.44,4.799,storage into the primary memory
202.08,3.76,now as because we need the execution of
204.239,3.761,the instructions to be as
205.84,4.479,quick as possible the sales in the
208.0,4.64,primary memory can be accessed in any
210.319,4.961,order and that's why the name
212.64,3.36,random access memory or ram to be
215.28,3.519,precise
216.0,4.08,it's actually dynamic ram because in
218.799,3.52,each memory chip
220.08,4.079,there is a transistor with which a
222.319,4.321,capacitor is associated
224.159,5.281,the transistors can retain the binary
226.64,3.84,bit as long as the associated capacitors
229.44,4.079,have charge
230.48,5.36,so periodic recharging is needed for
233.519,4.8,value retention and that's why it's
235.84,4.16,called dynamic but it's still slow for
238.319,4.241,the modern day processors
240.0,3.28,so we opt for another fast memory
242.56,3.2,storage
243.28,4.319,the cache now the cache is made up of
245.76,2.8,static ram which doesn't have any
247.599,3.521,capacitors
248.56,3.36,but they are very costly in comparison
251.12,4.16,to the main
251.92,5.599,or primary memory however cache happens
255.28,5.359,to be the fastest memory storage
257.519,5.841,among all others anyway all these
260.639,3.681,be that cache or main memory are
263.36,3.839,volatile
264.32,5.36,that means they can only retain the data
267.199,4.641,in them until the power is off
269.68,3.12,therefore to store the data more
271.84,3.04,permanently
272.8,3.44,we opt for the next type of memory
274.88,4.16,storage the
276.24,4.88,secondary memory now secondary memories
279.04,5.12,are slower than the main memory
281.12,5.68,yet they can retain data permanently
284.16,3.12,that is the data inside them are still
286.8,3.28,there
287.28,4.4,even if the power is off they are larger
290.08,3.76,in terms of capacity
291.68,4.4,also they are cheaper than the main
293.84,4.32,memory we will definitely get into the
296.08,3.28,detailed study of various types of
298.16,3.759,secondary memories
299.36,4.24,in our due course but for the time being
301.919,3.681,i would like to take an example
303.6,4.24,of one of the most popular secondary
305.6,2.72,storage devices that is the hard disk
307.84,2.56,drive
308.32,4.48,to explain one of the reasons why these
310.4,4.639,are slower compared to the main memory
312.8,3.52,for a hard disk drive the axis is
315.039,4.321,semi-random
316.32,5.84,now why is so because using this
319.36,4.0,red right head we can randomly get to
322.16,3.599,any of these
323.36,4.48,tracks but from there getting to the
325.759,2.72,particular block where the data is
327.84,3.52,stored
328.479,3.601,requires sequential movement so the time
331.36,3.36,to access
332.08,3.36,any data in the hard disk drive becomes
334.72,3.6,longer
335.44,3.599,naturally now let me show you the big
338.32,2.879,picture
339.039,4.321,we have the processor and it has got its
341.199,4.0,registers but these are not capable of
343.36,3.839,storing large amount of data
345.199,3.521,to be really honest they can barely
347.199,4.161,store a single instruction
348.72,4.72,so we opt for main memory yet main
351.36,4.72,memory is also slow for the processor
353.44,4.16,so we stored the frequently accessed
356.08,4.32,stuffs in a smaller
357.6,3.439,yet faster than main memory speed memory
360.4,3.359,storage
361.039,4.0,the cache it's like keeping our phones
363.759,3.28,in our pockets
365.039,3.761,instead of the backpack that we are
367.039,3.361,carrying because we tend to use the
368.8,3.76,phone very frequently
370.4,4.96,now the main memory and the cachet
372.56,4.639,communicates using data word or block
375.36,3.119,and the ways the communication takes
377.199,4.401,place is known as
378.479,5.761,cache memory mapping worry not we will
381.6,5.76,learn every type of these in details
384.24,6.0,later so having this organization
387.36,3.52,does speed things up a notch but none of
390.24,3.519,these
390.88,3.52,retain data permanently so we need a
393.759,3.041,permanent
394.4,3.12,non-volatile storage the secondary
396.8,2.56,memory
397.52,4.16,using the virtual memory mapping
399.36,3.2,technique the operating system lets the
401.68,2.959,main memory
402.56,3.84,and the auxiliary secondary storage
404.639,4.641,communicate with one another
406.4,5.12,using pages for this to happen the
409.28,2.96,operating system must be capable of
411.52,4.239,performing
412.24,5.44,paging or demand paging fun fact
415.759,3.84,the processor is aware of the presence
417.68,4.639,of the registers the caches
419.599,3.361,even the main memory but it has got no
422.319,2.401,clue
422.96,3.12,about the existence of the secondary
424.72,3.919,memory there
426.08,4.399,the operating system comes at rescue and
428.639,4.881,manages all the things
430.479,5.201,so to conclude having a single large
433.52,4.16,memory is not really a solution
435.68,3.28,instead we use different types of
437.68,4.56,storage units
438.96,5.519,in an organized fashion so
442.24,4.399,that was all for this session in the
444.479,4.401,next one we will get into the details of
446.639,3.761,these memory storages and learn about
448.88,3.439,the memory hierarchy
450.4,14.479,hope to see you in the next one thank
452.319,14.641,you all for watching
464.879,2.081,you
