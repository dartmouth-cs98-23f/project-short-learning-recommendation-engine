0.4,7.68,"Data science and data analytics. Are they the 
same thing? Well, you may have seen these terms  "
8.08,7.16,"used interchangeably, but if I'm mining data from 
a large dataset, am I performing data science or  "
15.24,5.6,"am I performing data analytics? Or what if I'm 
trying to create a prediction of when my store  "
20.84,6.84,"will sell out of our current inventory of 
cantaloupes? Well, is that analytics or is  "
27.68,6.08,"that science? It's worthwhile to understand the 
difference to better comprehend what these two  "
33.76,6.44,"fields can do, and also, if you're considering 
a career in either field. After all, these are two  "
40.2,9.16,"different jobs. Somebody who works in the field 
of data science is known as a data scientist.  "
49.36,10.08,"For data analytics, that role is called a data 
analyst. Now, this is kind of a trick question  "
59.44,5.68,"because we can classify everything-- data 
mining, data forecasting and all the rest of  "
65.12,7.2,"it --as simply data science. And that's because 
data science is the overarching umbrella term  "
72.32,5.24,"that covers tasks related to finding patterns in 
large datasets, training machine learning models,  "
77.56,9.32,"and deploying AI applications. Data analytics, it 
could be argued, is one task that resides under  "
86.88,7.16,"the data science umbrella. It's a specialization 
of data science, and it focuses on querying,  "
94.04,7.72,"interpreting and visualizing datasets. Data 
science is iterative, meaning data scientists form  "
101.76,5.76,"hypotheses and experiments to see if a desired 
outcome can be achieved using available data.  "
107.52,9.44,"And that is a process that is known as the data 
science lifecycle, which usually follows seven  "
116.96,9.4,"phases. So first is to identify a problem or an 
opportunity. Then the next phase is data mining,  "
126.36,6.28,"which is to extract data relevant to that problem 
or opportunity from large datasets. Now that data  "
132.64,6.24,"will likely consist of a bunch of redundancies 
and errors, which is fixed in the next stage,  "
138.88,8.04,"data cleaning. And then at that point, we move on 
to data exploration analysis to try to make sense  "
146.92,7.44,"of that data. We'll then apply feature engineering 
using domain knowledge to extract details from the  "
154.36,7.88,"data. And predictive modeling comes next to use 
the data to predict or forecast future outcomes  "
162.24,6.8,"and behaviors. And then finally, we have data 
visualization that represents the data points with  "
169.04,5.36,"graphical tools such as charts and animations. 
And so the lifecycle repeats. Now, the role of a  "
174.4,5.36,"data scientist is an in-demand profession right 
now. If that's something you're interested in,  "
179.76,5.16,"you'll want to develop deep skills in machine 
learning and AI. It's helpful to be able to  "
184.92,9.16,"write code in languages such as Python--also in R-- 
it's another popular language for data science. And  "
194.08,8.52,"you should have experience working with big data 
platforms. So perhaps Hadoop or Apache Spark. And  "
202.6,7.84,"it's also very helpful to have database knowledge 
and SQL. So that's data science. But what about  "
210.44,8.72,"its specialization, data analytics? Well, the job 
of a data analyst is to conceptualize a data set  "
219.16,9.16,"as it currently exists. So we have some data 
here and we need to do something with it. And  "
228.32,5.52,"we need to be able to make decisions based on 
this data. How do we conceptualize it? Well,  "
233.84,6.76,"four ways. One is through predictive analytics, 
which helps to identify trends, correlations and  "
240.6,6.28,"causation within datasets like forecasting when 
those cantaloupes would have all flown off the  "
246.88,6.8,"shelves. Or, in health care, to forecast regions 
which will experience a rise in flu cases. There's  "
253.68,6.08,"prescriptive analytics, and that predicts likely 
outcomes and makes decision recommendations like  "
259.76,6.44,"predicting when a tire will wear out and need 
to be replaced. There's diagnostic analytics  "
266.2,5.68,"that helps pinpoint the reason an event occurred. 
Manufacturers can analyze a failed component on an  "
271.88,6.76,"assembly line and figure out the reason behind its 
failure. And then there is descriptive analytics  "
278.64,5.48,"which evaluates the qualities and quantities of 
a data set. A content streaming provider might  "
284.12,5.24,"use descriptive analytics to understand how many 
subscribers it's lost or how many it's gained over  "
289.36,7.44,"a given period of time and what content is being 
watched. And while a data scientist is a clearly  "
296.8,7.04,"defined and specialized role, virtually any 
stakeholder can be a data analyst. For example,  "
303.84,6.44,"business analysts can use BI dashboards to conduct 
business analytics and visualize KPIs. But many  "
310.28,6.68,"organizations do employ professional, dedicated 
data analysts, responsible for data wrangling  "
316.96,5.48,"and interpreting findings like why a company's 
marketing campaign didn't meet expectations. If  "
322.44,7.12,"you want to be a data analyst, it helps to have 
both analytical and programming skills. So this  "
329.56,9.36,"includes familiarity with databases. Also, you'll 
need to know about statistical analysis. And also  "
338.92,8.56,"data visualization is another important skill. 
So data analytics is often more focused on using  "
347.48,6.08,"statistical tools and techniques to interpret 
existing data and offer actionable insights.  "
353.56,4.64,"It's usually less concerned with creating 
new algorithms or models. Data science,  "
358.2,5.28,"on the other hand, has a broader scope that can 
involve complex machine learning algorithms, often  "
363.48,5.92,"created from scratch. Data science focuses 
on phases from data collection to predictive  "
369.4,6.32,"modeling. Data analysis, on the other hand, is 
more about answering specific questions with  "
375.72,6.76,"that data. And if you've done both your 
data science and data analytics right,  "
382.48,6.92,"you'll always be able to keep cantaloupes 
and just about everything else in stock."
