18.8,5.76,i'm gonna tell you why you should learn
20.88,6.319,html html is an acronym for hypertext
24.56,4.719,markup language it's the most basic
27.199,5.04,building block of the web it allows you
29.279,4.481,to add change and remove website content
32.239,3.681,and that's a good thing to know it's
33.76,3.92,mandatory to know for web developers if
35.92,3.52,you would like to enter that career
37.68,3.36,field it's useful for software
39.44,3.52,developers marketing and sales
41.04,4.08,professionals if you need to edit a
42.96,3.759,listing for your company business owners
45.12,3.84,you could make your own website and
46.719,3.921,freelancers people would pay good money
48.96,3.919,for a good website heck you might as
50.64,5.599,well add html to your resume can't hurt
52.879,5.2,and learning html is super easy this
56.239,5.361,full course is only going to be about an
58.079,6.16,hour anybody can learn html even you yes
61.6,4.879,whoever's watching this video learn html
64.239,3.92,it's super easy what do you have to lose
66.479,3.921,building a website is a lot like
68.159,4.081,building a house first we need a solid
70.4,3.92,foundation and we need to build a
72.24,4.239,skeletal structure that's where html
74.32,4.159,comes in it's the most basic building
76.479,5.68,block of the web then after that we can
78.479,6.481,add css css is cascading style sheets
82.159,4.881,with css we can style color and change
84.96,4.159,the appearance of a webpage and lastly
87.04,4.64,there's javascript javascript adds
89.119,4.881,functionality to a webpage so in a house
91.68,4.64,this could be like plumbing heating and
94.0,4.32,air conditioning and electricity so it
96.32,4.08,adds functionality and when you combine
98.32,3.68,these three levels you have a good
100.4,3.12,functioning webpage but you need to
102.0,3.6,start somewhere so that's why you're
103.52,4.239,gonna learn html first what will you
105.6,4.32,need you'll need a web browser use
107.759,4.4,whatever web browser that you like just
109.92,4.879,please do not use internet explorer and
112.159,5.841,we'll also need a text editor to write
114.799,5.68,html code you can use vs code sublime
118.0,4.64,text heck you can even use notepad but i
120.479,5.401,prefer vs code so i'll show you where to
122.64,5.36,download that head to
125.88,3.879,code.visualstudio.com and download the
128.0,3.76,correct version for your operating
129.759,4.161,system i'm running windows so i'm going
131.76,3.839,to install the windows version then i
133.92,3.84,will open when done
135.599,4.241,accept the agreement
137.76,4.479,yes i actually did read it that fast i
139.84,5.119,would recommend creating a desktop icon
142.239,5.441,and make sure add to path is selected
144.959,5.36,next and install and then you might as
147.68,4.96,well launch this bad boy so finish we
150.319,4.881,are now within vs code the first thing i
152.64,5.04,recommend is to download the live server
155.2,4.88,extension so that after saving an html
157.68,5.12,document we can immediately refresh a
160.08,5.76,web page so underneath the search box
162.8,5.68,for extensions we are looking for live
165.84,4.399,server and install this version then
168.48,4.24,after downloading the live server
170.239,5.28,extension we will create a new folder
172.72,4.879,under the explorer tab open folder
175.519,3.681,wherever you want create a new folder
177.599,4.401,i'll create this on my desktop just for
179.2,5.44,convenience i'm going to create a new
182.0,4.72,folder i'll name this website
184.64,4.4,or whatever you want doesn't matter
186.72,4.239,then select folder and within our
189.04,6.479,website folder we're going to create a
190.959,6.56,new file name this index.html
195.519,3.921,whatever file you would like to be the
197.519,3.401,home page of your website you'll want to
199.44,3.92,name that as
200.92,5.08,index.html when a connection is made to
203.36,6.08,a website without a specific file in the
206.0,4.2,url most servers by default will return
209.44,3.76,the
210.2,5.8,index.html file as a landing page so
213.2,5.44,this index.html file will be the home
216.0,4.239,page the landing page of our website at
218.64,3.84,the top of our document we're going to
220.239,6.161,type this within angle brackets
222.48,6.319,exclamation point doc type html
226.4,5.04,html documents should start with this
228.799,5.281,declaration to be compliant with basic
231.44,5.6,html standards it lets a visitor's web
234.08,5.04,browser know that this is an html5
237.04,5.44,document and following this text will
239.12,5.44,create a pair of html tags tags are the
242.48,4.399,keywords within angle brackets that a
244.56,4.64,web page uses to define how your web
246.879,4.401,browser will format and display content
249.2,5.28,and usually these come in pairs so we'll
251.28,6.0,need an opening html tag and a closing
254.48,6.4,html tag all of our html code will be
257.28,6.16,within these html tags so the html
260.88,5.039,element represents the root of an html
263.44,5.36,document and there's two major sections
265.919,5.681,head and body so let's create a pair of
268.8,5.52,head tags head represents information
271.6,5.68,about a web page and there is also body
274.32,4.72,as well so create a pair of body tags
277.28,3.84,the body is what you would like to
279.04,4.32,display to a user the head is
281.12,3.76,information about the web page one thing
283.36,4.64,that we can add to the head of our
284.88,6.16,document is a title so we'll need a pair
288.0,3.04,of title tags
291.36,4.0,and let's create a title for our website
294.4,3.76,my
295.36,4.72,first website and then let's save let's
298.16,4.64,open this document so i'm going to right
300.08,5.6,click open with live server so the title
302.8,4.64,of this web page is my first website and
305.68,4.56,you may have noticed that this web
307.44,4.72,browser was opened with edge so you can
310.24,4.799,actually change that to a different web
312.16,4.24,browser and here's how go to file
315.039,2.641,preferences
316.4,4.079,settings
317.68,4.64,underneath extensions head to
320.479,4.72,live server config
322.32,5.2,custom browser and select a web browser
325.199,4.801,of your choosing so right click open
327.52,4.239,with live server and we are now using a
330.0,4.56,different web browser so i'm just going
331.759,5.121,to put my web browser and vs code side
334.56,4.72,by side
336.88,4.96,now let's add some text to the body of
339.28,4.56,our webpage type whatever you want i
341.84,4.079,like pizza
343.84,4.56,then i'm going to save
345.919,4.881,there we go we added some text to the
348.4,5.12,body of our html document and we can
350.8,6.399,also use a pair of header tags so
353.52,6.08,surround some text with h1 this is the
357.199,4.481,largest header tag and then make sure to
359.6,4.879,close it afterwards okay so then we have
361.68,5.92,h2 which is smaller
364.479,5.681,we have h3
367.6,2.56,h4
370.479,2.641,h5
373.44,5.12,and the last one is h6
376.88,3.439,so if you need some sort of title for
378.56,5.359,your web page you can always play some
380.319,5.681,text within a pair of h1 header tags
383.919,4.4,before i discuss p tags we should
386.0,4.96,discuss what elements are elements
388.319,5.041,embody the opening tag any content
390.96,5.6,within and the closing tag so for
393.36,5.679,example this is a opening title tag and
396.56,4.72,a closing title tag and all of these
399.039,5.28,together including any content within is
401.28,5.6,known as the title element so that's the
404.319,5.6,difference between tags and elements
406.88,4.719,tags make up a portion of elements and
409.919,4.161,with that out of the way we can move on
411.599,4.561,to paragraph elements paragraph elements
414.08,4.88,are made up of p tags we need an opening
416.16,5.12,p tag and a closing piece egg and we can
418.96,3.44,type some text within these paragraph
421.28,5.039,tags
422.4,6.639,this is some sample text browsers
426.319,5.521,automatically add a blank line of before
429.039,5.121,and after any paragraph elements also if
431.84,5.52,you need some longer sample text there
434.16,4.96,is a shortcut type lorem then tab
437.36,3.839,and that will create some sample text
439.12,4.4,for you and let's create another
441.199,5.12,paragraph element so we need an opening
443.52,5.2,p tag and a closing p tag i would like
446.319,5.28,some more sample text i will type lorem
448.72,5.12,then tab and we now have two paragraph
451.599,4.72,elements if you need a paragraph of
453.84,4.4,information to display with blank lines
456.319,4.72,before and after you can always surround
458.24,6.32,some text within a pair of p tags now
461.039,5.44,there's also a br element and these do
464.56,3.759,not need closing tags it's only an
466.479,5.521,opening tag wherever you would like to
468.319,5.6,add a line break just add a br element
472.0,4.479,so let's say i would like to space out
473.919,4.881,these header tags well i can add a line
476.479,4.801,break between each of these
478.8,5.04,if you ever need a line break just use a
481.28,4.8,vr element and like i said there's no
483.84,5.44,closing tag with these elements there's
486.08,6.399,also an hr element and i do not mean
489.28,5.199,human resources i mean horizontal rule
492.479,4.0,if you ever need to divide your page
494.479,4.321,section by section you can always add a
496.479,4.481,horizontal rule let's say that we have a
498.8,6.399,title to this webpage i'll create an h1
500.96,5.919,header tag this is my website
505.199,3.12,and then i'm just going to close this
506.879,4.081,what if i would like to divide this
508.319,5.361,webpage section by section i can always
510.96,5.12,add a horizontal rule by using an hr
513.68,4.32,element and there is no closing tag with
516.08,4.639,this element you just type hr with an
518.0,4.479,angle brackets and this will divide a
520.719,4.161,section of your webpage and add a
522.479,5.441,horizontal rule which looks pretty nice
524.88,4.399,so that is the hr element and the last
527.92,3.76,thing we're going to discuss for this
529.279,4.081,topic is comments comments will not be
531.68,4.32,displayed within the body of your
533.36,4.96,document it's more or less a note for
536.0,4.399,yourself or other developers to create a
538.32,4.32,comment we need an angle bracket
540.399,3.841,exclamation point then two dashes and
542.64,3.36,this will create the ending of your
544.24,4.4,comment which is an arrow pointing to
546.0,5.04,the right so anything between these two
548.64,5.199,arrows will be a comment i'll leave a
551.04,7.2,comment for i don't know myself
553.839,6.321,this is the best website ever
558.24,3.84,so as you can see this will not be
560.16,4.96,displayed within my webpage it's
562.08,5.36,basically used as a note for yourself or
565.12,4.88,for other people looking over this html
567.44,5.68,document so yeah those are comments well
570.0,4.8,everybody that is the basics of html so

584.16,4.0,video i'm going to show you how we can
585.44,7.519,have some fun with hyperlinks and html
588.16,4.799,so sit back relax and enjoy the show

595.04,4.96,remember to like comment and subscribe
598.08,3.12,your support will help keep this channel
600.0,4.399,running
601.2,6.56,sup people so hyperlinks we can apply a
604.399,5.361,hyperlink to text buttons images
607.76,3.84,elements of that nature whatever you
609.76,4.4,would like to turn into a hyperlink
611.6,4.88,surround with a pair of a tags
614.16,4.88,there's an opening a tag and a closing a
616.48,5.28,tag and within the opening a tag there
619.04,5.919,is an href attribute that you can set to
621.76,5.12,a url of your choosing so if i want this
624.959,5.361,hyperlink to take me to google then i
626.88,6.48,will fill out the url for google
630.32,5.6,so after saving if i click on this link
633.36,4.96,it takes me to google easy enough right
635.92,5.039,now there is a target attribute you can
638.32,6.48,open a web page in a new tab or window
640.959,6.0,by setting this to underscore blank
644.8,3.12,so this should open in a new tab or
646.959,3.761,window
647.92,4.479,but the default is self
650.72,4.64,so that this will open in the same
652.399,4.88,window there is a title a title is a
655.36,4.159,small pop-up box that will appear when
657.279,4.481,you hover your cursor over this link we
659.519,5.201,could write a message like this
661.76,4.88,takes you to google
664.72,4.48,and that box should appear after you
666.64,4.72,hover your cursor over this hyperlink
669.2,3.759,this takes you to google let's say you
671.36,3.599,have another webpage and you would like
672.959,4.56,this link to take you to your second
674.959,5.761,page let's change the text
677.519,5.521,uh go to page two i'm going to create
680.72,4.48,another html file real quick i'll go to
683.04,3.84,new file let's call this page two dot
685.2,3.68,html
686.88,4.079,if you need to generate the necessary
688.88,4.8,body of an html document if you're using
690.959,4.081,vs code you can type exclamation point
693.68,3.599,and then tab
695.04,5.44,and let's write a message
697.279,5.761,this is page two
700.48,4.799,if i set the href attribute equal to the
703.04,4.56,relative file path of whatever page i
705.279,4.321,would like to go to then this hyperlink
707.6,3.52,will take me there so these files are
709.6,3.6,right next to each other i only have to
711.12,5.76,list the file name so i would like this
713.2,6.079,hyperlink to take me to page2.htm
716.88,5.199,so if i click on this hyperlink
719.279,4.881,it will take me to my other html file
722.079,3.921,this is useful if you have a navigation
724.16,3.52,bar so depending on the link that
726.0,3.839,somebody clicks on your navigation bar
727.68,3.76,that can take you to a different page
729.839,3.921,and lastly you can send an email to
731.44,5.76,somebody within the href attribute type
733.76,7.04,mail to colon then some email address
737.2,6.56,let's say fake123 gmail.com
740.8,4.4,let's say email me instead
743.76,3.04,and then when you click on this link it
745.2,2.8,will begin the process of sending an
746.8,3.44,email
748.0,4.079,but we won't actually complete it so
750.24,4.399,yeah everybody those are hyperlinks you
752.079,4.401,can apply hyperlinks to text buttons
754.639,3.841,images which we'll have some practice
756.48,5.76,with in the future so yeah those are
758.48,3.76,hyperlinks and html
763.04,4.16,all right people here's how to add an
765.04,4.0,image to a web page find or download an
767.2,3.759,image of your choosing i just so happen
769.04,4.64,to have a picture of shrek within your
770.959,5.041,folder containing your index.html file
773.68,4.159,you're going to move or paste that image
776.0,3.68,within the same folder and within the
777.839,4.0,body element we're going to create a new
779.68,5.52,element an image element within angle
781.839,6.081,brackets type img for image this is a
785.2,4.639,self-closing tag and many elements have
787.92,4.08,different attributes that we can change
789.839,4.0,we need to change the source attribute
792.0,5.279,of this image element the source
793.839,5.761,attribute is src and we will set this
797.279,5.441,equal to within double quotes the name
799.6,4.0,of our image mine is shrek.png and then
802.72,2.64,save
803.6,4.0,what i like to do if i'm working with
805.36,4.32,the webpage that has a lot of images i
807.6,4.64,like to create a separate folder for my
809.68,4.48,images this isn't necessary but if your
812.24,4.08,image is located within a separate
814.16,5.039,folder we need to find the file path
816.32,4.72,relative to your index.html file so i'm
819.199,4.0,going to create a new folder and let's
821.04,4.479,name this images it will contain all the
823.199,4.64,images from my webpage then i will move
825.519,4.32,my image to my images folder so we can
827.839,4.281,no longer locate this image we need to
829.839,5.36,find the file path relative to the
832.12,5.399,index.html file to look within my images
835.199,3.2,folder i will precede the image name
837.519,2.721,with
838.399,4.8,forward slash the name of the folder
840.24,5.12,images slash the name of the image and
843.199,4.481,there it is personally if i'm working
845.36,4.88,with a lot of images i like to place all
847.68,4.399,of my images within one folder if you
850.24,4.399,decide to do that as well you just need
852.079,4.32,to precede the file name with the name
854.639,3.681,of the folder that it's in here's my
856.399,4.0,image but it's fairly massive we can
858.32,4.16,change the width and height attributes
860.399,5.921,if we need to i will change the height
862.48,6.799,attribute height equals maybe 200 and
866.32,4.639,that's a lot smaller maybe 300 that's a
869.279,3.601,little bit better the height and the
870.959,3.281,width will scale proportionately with
872.88,3.759,each other but you can change them
874.24,4.24,individually let's change the width
876.639,4.401,width equals
878.48,5.2,let's say 100
881.04,6.08,what we get is an extra skinnyshrek and
883.68,6.159,if i change this to maybe 600 well shrek
887.12,4.959,is extra thick now so i will just only
889.839,4.481,change the height attribute so that the
892.079,4.161,width attribute scales proportionately
894.32,3.84,now if somebody is visually impaired
896.24,3.76,they may be using a screen reader to
898.16,3.919,navigate a web page it would be good
900.0,4.32,practice to add some alternative text
902.079,4.801,that is read out loud by a screen reader
904.32,4.24,so that is the alt attribute within
906.88,3.44,double quotes i'll type a brief
908.56,5.92,description of this image
910.32,5.6,this is a picture of shrek so when you
914.48,3.919,add an image it's considered good
915.92,4.479,practice to add some alternative text
918.399,4.401,you can also add a title too a title
920.399,4.721,will be a small pop-up box that appears
922.8,4.64,when you hover your cursor over an image
925.12,4.079,to add a title set the title attribute
927.44,4.079,equal to some text
929.199,3.681,uh shrek is
931.519,3.361,shrek see
932.88,4.48,and then i'm going to save hover my
934.88,5.44,cursor over the image and we can see a
937.36,5.599,small pop-up box that has my title shrek
940.32,5.12,is shreksy we can also turn an image
942.959,4.401,into a hyperlink to turn this image into
945.44,3.68,a hyperlink we need to surround our
947.36,3.52,image element with an opening and
949.12,4.159,closing a tag
950.88,4.639,so open and close within the opening a
953.279,5.12,tag there is an href attribute that we
955.519,5.201,can set to a url of our choosing i think
958.399,5.041,i'll set this hyperlink to the wikipedia
960.72,5.679,page for shrek so just type in the url
963.44,4.88,between these double quotes save then if
966.399,4.24,i were to click on my image this will
968.32,4.24,take me to the wikipedia page for shrek
970.639,4.081,or some other url depending on what you
972.56,4.24,type here so yeah that's how to add an
974.72,4.32,image to a web page within the body
976.8,4.24,element you need to add an image element
979.04,3.599,and then set the source equal to the
981.04,3.52,image name if you found this video
982.639,3.521,helpful please remember to smash that
984.56,3.279,like button leave a random comment down
986.16,4.72,below and subscribe if you'd like to
987.839,3.041,become a fellow bro
992.72,4.0,if you do need an mp3 file to work with
994.8,4.479,for this video i recommend heading to
996.72,4.16,the youtube audio library and then you
999.279,4.401,can search and download a song of your
1000.88,5.12,choosing so after you find an mp3 file
1003.68,4.68,you can use a wav file too just drag and
1006.0,5.279,drop it to your folder containing your
1008.36,5.56,index.html file and then we can head to
1011.279,5.041,vs code now to add audio to our web page
1013.92,5.52,we need an audio element
1016.32,6.48,so within angle brackets audio and list
1019.44,5.28,the source equal to the name of your mp3
1022.8,4.879,or wav file we're going to need some
1024.72,4.8,controls so this is a boolean attribute
1027.679,4.0,we don't need to set the sql to anything
1029.52,3.84,it's either true or false and to set it
1031.679,4.0,equal to true you just type the name of
1033.36,4.959,the attribute so within the audio
1035.679,5.36,element type controls and up top here we
1038.319,4.64,have our controls for our mp3 file with
1041.039,4.83,these controls we can play some audio
1042.959,6.08,file of our choosing
1045.869,6.071,[Music]
1049.039,8.161,we can fast forward
1051.94,6.94,[Music]
1057.2,4.0,and we can mute here's a couple other
1058.88,4.4,boolean attributes we can have our audio
1061.2,5.08,autoplay by using the autoplay boolean
1063.28,3.0,attribute
1067.76,4.72,if you would like this to be muted
1069.36,6.48,originally type muted so this is playing
1072.48,6.24,but you can't hear it because it's muted
1075.84,5.44,if you need this to loop just type loop
1078.72,4.16,yep and it's looping you can have backup
1081.28,3.84,audio files just in case your web
1082.88,4.08,browser doesn't support a given format
1085.12,3.52,so if you would like some backup audio
1086.96,3.28,files we're going to change this around
1088.64,3.68,a little bit so let's get rid of our
1090.24,2.96,source and we'll create an audio closing
1092.32,3.2,tag
1093.2,3.68,and we will create multiple nested
1095.52,2.64,source elements
1096.88,4.32,type source
1098.16,5.12,source equals the name of one audio file
1101.2,5.12,you would like to use primarily if you
1103.28,5.68,have a backup let's say we have the same
1106.32,4.56,song as a wav file you can do that too
1108.96,4.0,if for some reason the browser using
1110.88,4.48,doesn't support these first two audio
1112.96,6.8,files you can always display a message
1115.36,6.319,this browser does not support
1119.76,4.159,html5
1121.679,4.481,audio so yeah everybody that's how to
1123.919,4.321,add audio to a web page you just have to
1126.16,4.32,use this audio element and set the
1128.24,4.48,source equal to an audio file of your
1130.48,3.76,choosing and there's a bunch of boolean
1132.72,3.44,attributes that you can add to if you
1134.24,3.52,would like some controls if you need to
1136.16,3.6,set this to autoplay if you need it
1137.76,4.159,muted and if you need it to loop so yeah
1139.76,3.84,that's how to add audio to a webpage if
1141.919,3.681,you found this video helpful please be
1143.6,4.0,sure to smash that like button leave a
1145.6,6.24,random comment down below and subscribe
1147.6,4.24,if you'd like to become a fellow bro
1152.4,3.519,all right welcome back everybody in this
1154.48,3.76,video i'm going to show you all how we
1155.919,4.88,can add a video to a web page you'll
1158.24,4.48,need a video of one of these file types
1160.799,4.321,when i was in tokyo some number of years
1162.72,4.079,ago i saw a real-life mario kart racing
1165.12,4.439,down the street so what i'm going to do
1166.799,5.441,is place this mp4 file next to my
1169.559,4.761,index.html file and then within vs code
1172.24,5.04,we need a video element
1174.32,4.719,and we will list the src attribute equal
1177.28,2.8,to the name of our file that we're
1179.039,3.76,working with
1180.08,5.2,and in my case it's racing.mp4 now this
1182.799,5.441,video is massive so let's change the
1185.28,5.759,width of this using the width attribute
1188.24,4.24,width equals what about
1191.039,3.361,500
1192.48,3.92,that's a lot better but we'll need some
1194.4,3.6,controls to actually play this video i'm
1196.4,4.24,clicking on this and nothing's happening
1198.0,4.4,controls is a boolean attribute we only
1200.64,3.36,have to list the attribute name to add
1202.4,5.44,controls
1204.0,3.84,there we go we now have some controls
1208.34,3.18,[Music]
1210.0,2.96,now if you want this to play maybe in
1211.52,3.039,the background and you do not want
1212.96,4.599,controls you can always set this to
1214.559,3.0,autoplay
1217.97,5.31,[Music]
1221.039,4.64,so i'm going to add the controls back if
1223.28,4.879,you need this muted just add the muted
1225.679,3.921,boolean attribute
1228.159,2.561,so it's playing but we can't hear
1229.6,3.04,anything
1230.72,4.4,and if you need this to loop just add
1232.64,4.159,the loop boolean attribute and this
1235.12,3.28,should loop
1236.799,3.041,yeah there it is here's another thing
1238.4,3.279,that we can try let's get rid of our
1239.84,5.28,source attribute and we're going to
1241.679,6.081,create a video closing tag
1245.12,5.6,and we will create nested sources within
1247.76,2.96,our video element
1251.12,5.679,source src equals our video file so just
1254.96,4.24,in case your browser doesn't support an
1256.799,4.961,mp4 video file you can always create
1259.2,5.76,another source
1261.76,5.36,let's say that we have a web m file as a
1264.96,4.48,backup just in case that this browser
1267.12,4.32,doesn't support an mp4 file and if for
1269.44,3.92,some reason that no other sources work
1271.44,5.719,you can always add a note
1273.36,5.439,this browser does not support
1277.159,3.801,html5
1278.799,3.601,audio so you can write it either way but
1280.96,3.44,if you have multiple sources you can
1282.4,3.92,always have backups just in case this
1284.4,4.159,primary source doesn't work so yeah
1286.32,4.0,everybody that's how to add a video to a
1288.559,3.841,webpage if you found this video helpful
1290.32,3.839,please be sure to smash that like button

1301.76,4.08,this video i'm going to show you all a
1303.52,3.92,few useful text formatting tags that you
1305.84,4.959,may be interested in we'll need some
1307.44,5.28,sample text to work with this is normal
1310.799,4.481,text we'll create additional lines of
1312.72,4.8,text so i'm going to surround this text
1315.28,4.16,with a pair of paragraph tags just so
1317.52,3.84,that when we add additional text they
1319.44,4.0,will be added to a new line let's copy
1321.36,4.64,this line and paste it nine additional
1323.44,4.56,times let's say
1326.0,4.96,there we go first set of text formatting
1328.0,5.2,tags that i'll show you is bold any text
1330.96,5.199,that you need to bold just surround that
1333.2,5.599,text with a pair of b tags we need an
1336.159,5.441,opening b tag and a closing beats egg
1338.799,5.681,this is normal text and you can see that
1341.6,4.64,the word normal is bold uh let's change
1344.48,3.679,that to bold just so that it's more
1346.24,3.84,descriptive of what it does
1348.159,3.921,okay so any text you need bold just
1350.08,4.8,surround with a pair of b tags the next
1352.08,5.12,set of tags is italic surround any text
1354.88,7.279,that you need italic with a pair of eye
1357.2,7.44,tags this is italic text we have big
1362.159,5.121,this is big text
1364.64,2.64,we have small
1367.679,5.601,this is small text sub for subscript
1373.52,5.76,this is subscript text superscript
1377.039,4.0,the tag name is sup like you're saying
1379.28,4.48,sup to somebody
1381.039,5.921,this is superscript text we have
1383.76,5.919,inserted inserted is just underlined
1386.96,5.36,ins for inserted
1389.679,5.521,this is inserted text
1392.32,5.359,there is deleted deleted will create a
1395.2,4.8,line through some text
1397.679,4.561,this is deleted text and there's one
1400.0,4.0,more it looks like i miscounted there's
1402.24,5.2,also marked
1404.0,6.08,so we use a pair of mark tags
1407.44,5.04,any text that is marked is highlighted
1410.08,4.16,so yeah those are a few text formatting
1412.48,3.28,tags that i thought you should know if
1414.24,3.6,you found this video helpful please be
1415.76,4.24,sure to smash that like button leave a
1417.84,5.68,random comment down below and subscribe
1420.0,3.52,if you'd like to become a fellow bro
1424.559,4.401,hey welcome back in this video i'm going
1427.039,3.921,to show you all how we can create lists
1428.96,4.4,in html there's three lists we're going
1430.96,4.4,to talk about unordered ordered and
1433.36,4.0,description lists let's begin with
1435.36,5.52,unordered lists to create an unordered
1437.36,6.72,list we need a pair of ul tags for an
1440.88,5.919,unordered list and between these ul tags
1444.08,5.68,we can create individual list items and
1446.799,4.721,we use a pair of li tags for each item
1449.76,3.68,we would like to add to our list so
1451.52,3.92,what's an example of an unordered list
1453.44,3.839,one thing that comes to mind is a
1455.44,3.2,shopping list like a grocery list
1457.279,2.961,because well i'm kind of hungry right
1458.64,3.6,now it's breakfast time let's say that
1460.24,4.4,we're going to bake a pizza and we need
1462.24,5.6,a list of ingredients we need pizza
1464.64,6.56,dough so add an item between this pair
1467.84,5.6,of li tags and we now have one bulleted
1471.2,4.24,item within our unordered list and let's
1473.44,4.56,create another item so we can just copy
1475.44,4.32,and paste this pair of li tags and
1478.0,4.48,create a new list item
1479.76,5.44,what about tomato sauce
1482.48,4.319,and then maybe cheese
1485.2,3.76,and toppings
1486.799,5.36,point being to create an unordered list
1488.96,5.04,you need a pair of ul tags and with each
1492.159,3.921,list item you would like to add to your
1494.0,5.12,unordered list you just place within a
1496.08,6.32,pair of li tags for list item an ordered
1499.12,6.0,list is very similar except we use ol
1502.4,5.68,tags so we need an opening ol tag and a
1505.12,5.28,closing ol tag so by default each list
1508.08,5.12,item is going to be numbered so let's
1510.4,5.279,say that we have a to-do list
1513.2,5.76,to add a list item we need to use a pair
1515.679,4.961,of li tags perhaps this is a schedule of
1518.96,3.599,what we have to do in the morning we
1520.64,4.08,have to eat breakfast
1522.559,4.321,that could be one list item
1524.72,4.48,so to add another item we need another
1526.88,5.279,pair of li tags
1529.2,4.8,then maybe we need to take a shower
1532.159,4.0,so each of these is numbered and they're
1534.0,5.2,in ascending order
1536.159,6.241,and then we want to what about
1539.2,5.68,leave for work okay so yeah that is an
1542.4,4.72,ordered list the order of the list items
1544.88,4.88,does matter and we can change the type
1547.12,5.039,too within the opening oil tag there is
1549.76,4.72,a type attribute we can set each list
1552.159,5.361,item to a number a letter or roman
1554.48,5.28,numerals if i would instead like letters
1557.52,4.0,i can just set the type equal to a and
1559.76,4.0,our list items are now marked with the
1561.52,5.2,letter and we have description lists we
1563.76,4.24,need a pair of dl tags for description
1566.72,3.92,lists
1568.0,6.64,and instead of using an li tag for each
1570.64,7.36,list item we use a pair of dt tags for
1574.64,6.399,description term and dd tags for
1578.0,6.08,description definition so for a term
1581.039,5.841,that is dt and then we add a definition
1584.08,5.599,to this term let's say we have a list of
1586.88,6.64,web dev languages for a term we need an
1589.679,5.6,opening dt tag and a closing dt tag
1593.52,5.039,and then we can add a definition to this
1595.279,5.361,term so that would be dd description
1598.559,5.041,definition between the opening and
1600.64,5.12,closing dd tags we can add a definition
1603.6,5.04,to this term
1605.76,7.2,let's say that this adds
1608.64,6.24,structure to a web page
1612.96,5.68,and then to create another term and
1614.88,3.76,definition pair we can just copy this
1619.44,5.04,let's add css this adds style to a web
1623.12,4.679,page
1624.48,3.319,then javascript
1628.64,4.159,this adds
1629.96,5.319,functionality to a webpage with
1632.799,5.36,description lists each list item is a
1635.279,4.321,pair of terms and definitions the last
1638.159,3.841,thing i'm going to show you you can
1639.6,4.4,create a nested list within a list so
1642.0,4.24,let's say i would like to add a sub list
1644.0,5.44,of individual toppings to our unordered
1646.24,5.6,list within the list item we just create
1649.44,4.88,a new list let's say that i would like
1651.84,5.439,another unordered list so i need a pair
1654.32,4.719,of ul tags
1657.279,5.041,and what are some toppings we can place
1659.039,5.76,on our pizza so we need a list item
1662.32,4.0,what about pepperoni
1664.799,4.161,so we have a sub list going if you take
1666.32,3.599,a look on the webpage right now oh then
1668.96,2.4,maybe
1669.919,3.201,what about mushrooms next i like
1671.36,3.12,mushrooms
1673.12,3.919,and
1674.48,4.559,peppers i guess all right people those
1677.039,4.88,are how to create lists there's three
1679.039,5.441,types unordered ordered and description
1681.919,4.161,lists just use a pair of appropriate
1684.48,3.919,tags depending on the list you want to
1686.08,4.64,use so yeah everybody that's how to
1688.399,4.0,create different lists in html if you
1690.72,3.76,found this video helpful please remember
1692.399,4.0,to smash that like button leave a random
1694.48,3.919,comment down below and subscribe if
1696.399,4.16,you'd like to become a fellow bro
1698.399,3.681,hey it's you bro hope you're doing well
1700.559,4.561,and in this video i'm going to show you
1702.08,8.079,all how we can create a table using html
1705.12,6.799,so sit back relax and enjoy the show
1710.159,4.481,everyone i'm going to show you all how
1711.919,5.521,we can create a table using html let's
1714.64,5.12,say that we have a store not an online
1717.44,4.479,store but a brick and mortar store and
1719.76,4.639,our job is to create a table of the
1721.919,4.401,hours of operation for our store
1724.399,3.76,which we can best represent with the
1726.32,4.32,table on our website so to create a
1728.159,4.0,table we'll use a pair of table tags
1730.64,3.44,there's an opening table tag and a
1732.159,5.281,closing table tag to add a row to our
1734.08,5.68,table we can use a pair of tr tags for
1737.44,4.88,table row and let's say that we'll have
1739.76,4.799,two rows one for the days of the week
1742.32,4.32,and the other for the hours of operation
1744.559,5.6,so within this first row let's add some
1746.64,5.279,headers using th tags for table header
1750.159,4.24,and i'll list the days of the week so we
1751.919,4.88,have sunday through saturday so to add
1754.399,4.16,another header just use another pair of
1756.799,2.801,th tags
1758.559,3.201,sunday
1759.6,3.439,monday
1761.76,4.76,tuesday
1763.039,3.481,you get the rest
1772.88,4.399,table headers are inherently bold if we
1775.84,4.16,would like to add some data to the
1777.279,4.961,second row we'll add that between the tr
1780.0,5.44,tags for the second row
1782.24,5.439,so we would like some data which is td
1785.44,5.119,we need an opening td tag and a closing
1787.679,5.841,td tag for each cell let's pretend that
1790.559,5.041,our store is open monday through friday
1793.52,4.639,nine to five and closed on the weekends
1795.6,4.72,saturday and sunday this first cell is
1798.159,3.12,for the first day sunday the first
1800.32,4.079,column
1801.279,5.28,so we are closed this day let's copy our
1804.399,4.561,table data element and copy it this will
1806.559,5.761,be for the second row monday and we are
1808.96,6.719,open nine to five and let's fill this in
1812.32,6.0,for the days monday through friday
1815.679,4.641,and then saturday we are closed
1818.32,4.56,all right let's color in these cells
1820.32,4.64,i'll make the first row a dark gray
1822.88,5.12,color so to change the color of the
1824.96,5.439,first row within the opening tr tag for
1828.0,4.799,the first row there is a bg color
1830.399,4.321,attribute which means background color
1832.799,3.6,and i will set the sequel to gray and
1834.72,4.959,our second row let's make this light
1836.399,5.28,gray so within the opening tr tag for
1839.679,4.0,the second row let's set the bg color
1841.679,3.921,attribute equal to a different color
1843.679,3.441,like light gray pick whatever color you
1845.6,5.28,want it doesn't necessarily have to be
1847.12,7.039,gray so within the opening table tag i
1850.88,4.72,will set the bg color equal to what
1854.159,4.0,about black
1855.6,5.04,cool these cells are left aligned we can
1858.159,5.841,center them to center the cells within a
1860.64,5.759,row within the opening tr tag there is
1864.0,5.44,an align attribute and let's set this
1866.399,5.28,equal to center and the text is now
1869.44,4.88,centered and lastly let's make all of
1871.679,4.801,these cells the same size this wednesday
1874.32,6.479,cell is taking up a lot of space let's
1876.48,7.6,set the width equal to maybe 100 pixels
1880.799,3.281,and i will just copy this
1884.72,5.04,and with the opening table element i
1887.12,4.64,will set this equal to the width of each
1889.76,5.36,cell times the number of cells that we
1891.76,5.68,have so if each cell has a width of 100
1895.12,5.919,and there's seven cells i will set the
1897.44,5.839,width equal to 700.
1901.039,4.24,and well there we go all of these cells
1903.279,5.681,are now aligned so yeah that's how to
1905.279,7.201,create a table in html just use a pair
1908.96,6.079,of table tags for each row add a pair of
1912.48,5.199,tr tags if you need a row to function as
1915.039,5.601,a header such as the days of the week
1917.679,7.36,use th tags if you're filling in data
1920.64,6.399,for a cell use td tags for table data so
1925.039,4.081,yeah that's how to create a table in
1927.039,4.321,html if you found this video helpful
1929.12,4.0,please be sure to smash that like button

1933.12,3.2,subscribe if you'd like to become a
1934.559,4.0,fellow bro
1936.32,3.839,hey uh what's going on everybody in this
1938.559,4.881,video i'm going to show you how we can
1940.159,6.161,add color to a webpage so sit back relax
1943.44,2.88,and enjoy the show
1946.559,4.24,all right now here's how we can add
1948.48,4.48,color to a web page we'll be talking a
1950.799,5.12,little bit about css but we'll cover
1952.96,4.48,this more in depth in the css series i
1955.919,3.76,thought this would be a good place for
1957.44,4.719,us to introduce colors because we'll be
1959.679,4.561,able to color things like buttons and
1962.159,4.481,forms and whatnot here's how to add some
1964.24,4.799,color to a webpage within the opening
1966.64,5.2,tag of an element of your choosing
1969.039,5.681,there is a style attribute and within
1971.84,4.959,double quotes we can add css properties
1974.72,4.4,for my website i would like to change
1976.799,3.841,the background color to black because i
1979.12,3.919,think it would look cool so within
1980.64,4.72,double quotes list the css property you
1983.039,4.64,would like to change background color
1985.36,6.0,after the colon you can either add a
1987.679,6.081,color name rgb values or hexadecimal
1991.36,3.919,values let's just say the color black
1993.76,3.919,there we go we can no longer see my
1995.279,5.441,website let's change the font color of
1997.679,5.201,these individual h1 header tags again
2000.72,4.319,it's the same process as before
2002.88,4.72,style equals
2005.039,4.64,within double quotes list the css
2007.6,4.24,property you would like to add
2009.679,5.201,i would like to add color this time to
2011.84,6.48,change the font color and i will pick
2014.88,5.2,red there we go this time let's use rgb
2018.32,4.8,values
2020.08,5.52,so again style attribute equals the css
2023.12,6.72,property would like to change
2025.6,6.16,to instead use an rgb value type rgb
2029.84,4.16,parenthesis then i would recommend
2031.76,4.48,looking up a color picker
2034.0,4.88,and you can pick a color of whatever you
2036.24,6.24,would like uh what about blue
2038.88,6.56,perhaps that shade of blue so rgb values
2042.48,5.439,are in a group of three a triad
2045.44,5.679,so i will copy these three numbers and
2047.919,6.081,paste them within the parentheses of rgb
2051.119,5.441,and the second h1 header tag is now that
2054.0,6.159,specific shade of blue i tend to prefer
2056.56,5.44,to use rgb values or hexadecimal values
2060.159,4.881,over color names because you have more
2062.0,6.8,variety now let's use hexadecimal values
2065.04,5.839,style equals the css property
2068.8,4.319,of color
2070.879,3.52,so hexadecimal values always start with
2073.119,3.361,a hashtag
2074.399,4.801,what about green
2076.48,5.04,so we'll have red blue and green and i
2079.2,5.6,will copy this number they are in groups
2081.52,5.92,of six and well yeah it's green now cool
2084.8,4.96,right okay now let's change both the
2087.44,4.88,font color and the background color of
2089.76,4.8,this paragraph within the opening tag of
2092.32,5.44,this paragraph element
2094.56,5.68,we will set the style attribute equal
2097.76,3.44,to any css properties within double
2100.24,3.839,quotes
2101.2,4.159,let's change the background color first
2104.079,2.641,background
2105.359,2.801,dash color
2106.72,3.359,colon space
2108.16,3.919,i'll set this to
2110.079,3.601,dark gray which is
2112.079,4.321,2 2 2
2113.68,4.56,2 2 2 then to add multiple css
2116.4,4.56,properties separate each with a
2118.24,5.2,semicolon and this time i will change
2120.96,4.56,just the color and i'll use the same
2123.44,4.56,shade of green all right well there we
2125.52,4.559,go so yeah everybody that's how to add
2128.0,3.839,some colors to your webpage there's more
2130.079,4.721,advanced things we can do when we reach
2131.839,5.52,the video series on css but what you can
2134.8,4.96,do for now within the opening tag of an
2137.359,4.321,element of your choosing set the style
2139.76,4.079,attribute equal
2141.68,4.72,to whatever css properties you would
2143.839,4.641,like to add within quotes so yeah that's
2146.4,3.84,how to add color to webpage if you found
2148.48,3.68,this video helpful please be sure to
2150.24,3.76,smash that like button leave random
2152.16,5.959,comments down below and subscribe if
2154.0,4.119,you'd like to become a fellow bro
2158.56,5.76,hey welcome back in this video i'm going
2161.04,7.2,to explain the span and div tags let's
2164.32,6.799,begin with span span adds markup to text
2168.24,5.599,or portion of a document anything that i
2171.119,5.761,surround with a pair of spam tags i can
2173.839,5.681,apply markup or some effect to so in my
2176.88,5.12,example document i have a header and
2179.52,4.48,three paragraphs what if i would like
2182.0,3.92,this specific sentence to be i don't
2184.0,4.4,know red well what i could do is
2185.92,4.96,surround this sentence in my document
2188.4,4.8,with a pair of spam tags
2190.88,4.0,so i need an opening spam tag and a
2193.2,4.24,closing spam tag
2194.88,5.12,and that sentence ends right here and
2197.44,5.28,within the span tag i can change some of
2200.0,4.96,the attributes of this sentence um so i
2202.72,5.92,would like to change maybe the style
2204.96,5.76,i'll set the style color equal to red
2208.64,4.8,now you probably do want this closing
2210.72,4.8,tag if you do not have this closing tag
2213.44,3.36,your span will take up this entire
2215.52,4.0,section
2216.8,5.92,so basically that's what span is it adds
2219.52,6.319,markup to text or a portion of a
2222.72,5.68,document div is very similar except it
2225.839,4.561,divides a division of a document so what
2228.4,4.719,if i would like to change the background
2230.4,4.4,color of these three paragraphs well
2233.119,5.521,what we learned in the last video on
2234.8,5.2,colors is that we could set the style
2238.64,5.68,background
2240.0,7.04,color equal to some shade of gray maybe
2244.32,4.96,this value this does work and i could
2247.04,4.4,just copy this and paste it for each of
2249.28,4.48,these paragraphs
2251.44,5.12,or another way of doing this is that i
2253.76,4.96,can surround these three paragraphs with
2256.56,4.32,a pair of div tags
2258.72,5.119,so we need an opening div tag
2260.88,5.199,and a closing div tag
2263.839,5.28,and then i will apply this style
2266.079,4.561,attribute to the opening div tag
2269.119,4.24,and it will apply
2270.64,4.959,this attribute to anything between these
2273.359,5.281,div tags so yeah that's basically what
2275.599,5.921,the span and div tags do span adds
2278.64,5.6,markup to text or portion of a document
2281.52,7.52,div defines a division of a document so
2284.24,4.8,yeah that's span and div in html
2289.839,6.321,yeah let's begin so meta tags the meta
2293.359,5.681,element represents various kinds of
2296.16,5.76,metadata that cannot be expressed using
2299.04,6.559,the title base link style and script
2301.92,6.32,elements metadata is data about data we
2305.599,4.881,can add metadata to the head of our
2308.24,4.48,document and this tells the web browser
2310.48,4.48,what our web page is about with the meta
2312.72,4.32,tags we place them within the head not
2314.96,4.399,the body so we can tell the web browser
2317.04,4.799,some information about our web page meta
2319.359,5.441,tags are self closing we do not need a
2321.839,5.121,closing tag meta tags do have a name
2324.8,4.08,attribute that we can set to one of many
2326.96,4.48,settings let's say we would like to add
2328.88,4.32,a description to this webpage and the
2331.44,4.48,web browser is going to read this
2333.2,5.36,description after setting the name equal
2335.92,4.96,to description i can set the content
2338.56,3.44,equal to a brief description of my
2340.88,3.36,webpage
2342.0,6.0,uh perhaps free
2344.24,6.16,html tutorial for beginners
2348.0,4.96,okay so that's one example of a meta tag
2350.4,4.88,so let's create another so meta again
2352.96,4.48,these are self-closing tags and i can
2355.28,3.68,add some keywords for search engine
2357.44,3.6,optimization
2358.96,3.2,so name keywords
2361.04,3.28,content
2362.16,5.12,and i'll explain my web page in just a
2364.32,4.799,few keywords uh perhaps html separate
2367.28,3.68,each of these with a comma
2369.119,2.881,tutorial
2370.96,3.84,beginners
2372.0,4.72,that'd be good we can add a author
2374.8,4.64,meta name
2376.72,7.44,equals author
2379.44,4.72,content equals and then type your name
2384.24,4.4,so if somebody is viewing your web page
2386.32,4.799,on a mobile device you can have your web
2388.64,5.84,page scale to their mobile device by
2391.119,5.601,adding this meta tag name equals
2394.48,3.52,viewport
2396.72,3.359,content
2398.0,4.24,equals
2400.079,3.28,and this will set the width of our web
2402.24,5.2,page
2403.359,7.041,equal to device dash width
2407.44,4.08,then comma we can set the initial
2410.4,4.719,scale
2411.52,5.44,equal to 1.0 so by adding this meta tag
2415.119,4.561,if you were to view this webpage on a
2416.96,5.04,mobile device this web page will scale
2419.68,6.399,proportionately with that mobile device
2422.0,5.839,another meta tag is a char set
2426.079,3.841,we can tell a web browser what sort of
2427.839,5.041,character encoding that we're using
2429.92,4.399,so authors are encouraged to use utf-8
2432.88,3.28,for unicode
2434.319,3.441,so if you want to use basic ascii
2436.16,4.0,encoding you would write ascii here
2437.76,5.76,although that's discouraged authors are
2440.16,4.56,encouraged to use utf-8 for unicode
2443.52,3.44,all right and the last thing i'm going
2444.72,4.8,to show you is that we can set our web
2446.96,4.159,page to automatically refresh after a
2449.52,3.52,given amount of seconds
2451.119,3.601,so meta
2453.04,5.279,http
2454.72,4.8,dash equiv is the attribute name
2458.319,3.601,equals
2459.52,5.12,refresh
2461.92,4.0,and the content equals how many seconds
2464.64,2.8,you would like to wait to have your
2465.92,3.52,browser refresh
2467.44,4.399,uh perhaps 30.
2469.44,4.879,okay so i'm going to open this with live
2471.839,4.881,server so if i set this to 30 seconds
2474.319,4.321,it's not going to be that visible you're
2476.72,3.84,gonna have to wait until we see this
2478.64,4.08,refresh let's set this to something more
2480.56,4.88,drastic like two seconds let's crank
2482.72,4.8,this up yep see it's refreshing every
2485.44,4.72,two seconds uh but let's set that back
2487.52,4.64,to 30. two seconds was just an example
2490.16,4.32,so yeah those are meta tags they
2492.16,5.04,represent metadata
2494.48,5.119,is data about data by adding meta tags
2497.2,4.639,we can tell a web browser information
2499.599,5.121,about our website such as a brief
2501.839,5.201,description keywords author we can set
2504.72,4.56,the viewport for mobile devices you can
2507.04,4.559,set a refresh rate stuff like that and
2509.28,4.96,then be sure to add meta tags to the
2511.599,4.641,head element of your document so yeah
2514.24,3.92,those are meta tags if you found this
2516.24,3.52,video helpful please remember to smash
2518.16,3.439,that like button leave a random comment
2519.76,4.079,down below and subscribe if you'd like
2521.599,4.161,to become a fellow bro
2523.839,3.681,hey what's going on everybody it's you
2525.76,3.2,bro hope you're doing well and in this
2527.52,4.48,video i'm going to explain how we can
2528.96,5.44,use iframes to embed web pages and other
2532.0,5.839,documents within your website so sit
2534.4,3.439,back relax and enjoy the show
2538.4,5.84,hey welcome back iframes the iframe
2541.68,5.679,element is used to embed content from
2544.24,5.92,another source into an html document
2547.359,4.96,they're commonly used for advertisements
2550.16,4.4,and they're easily abused with many
2552.319,4.481,hacking techniques so basically using an
2554.56,4.72,iframe we can embed another web page
2556.8,5.2,within our webpage or we could embed our
2559.28,4.24,current html document with another html
2562.0,4.319,document here's how we can create an
2563.52,5.68,iframe this is a self-closing tag and we
2566.319,6.321,set the source equal to this can be an
2569.2,6.08,external website such as a url or we can
2572.64,4.8,place a relative file path to a file of
2575.28,4.799,our choosing so this doesn't work with
2577.44,5.48,many websites and i'll demonstrate that
2580.079,6.321,so let's set the source equal to
2582.92,6.12,google.com and then save and reload so
2586.4,4.959,google.com refused to connect that's
2589.04,4.559,because a lot of major websites have
2591.359,4.161,disabled the use of iframes since we're
2593.599,4.641,embedding another web page within our
2595.52,5.599,webpage a common hacking technique is
2598.24,5.119,that you can have this embedded webpage
2601.119,4.641,take up the entire frame of your html
2603.359,4.081,document your website could pose as
2605.76,3.599,another website and that could be
2607.44,4.159,considered dangerous let's say that you
2609.359,4.24,embed a banking website like bank of
2611.599,4.081,america so if somebody visits your
2613.599,3.681,website it's actually a facade and
2615.68,3.76,somebody will type in their banking
2617.28,4.16,information like their login credentials
2619.44,4.24,and you could capture that so a lot of
2621.44,4.72,major websites have disabled the use of
2623.68,4.72,iframes so you cannot pose as their
2626.16,4.48,website one website that i checked that
2628.4,5.36,does work is bing
2630.64,4.88,so let's switch our url to that save and
2633.76,4.0,reload
2635.52,4.48,yeah see we have embedded the home page
2637.76,4.0,of bing but let's change the width and
2640.0,4.839,height attributes because this is fairly
2641.76,6.0,small let's say the width is
2644.839,5.081,750 pixels and for the height let's say
2647.76,4.24,maybe 250.
2649.92,4.48,so save and reload
2652.0,4.0,cool yeah we have embedded bing within
2654.4,2.64,our webpage and you can use this
2656.0,1.839,normally
2657.04,2.96,bro
2657.839,4.321,code
2660.0,4.48,now let's embed another document so
2662.16,3.679,let's create a new file
2664.48,3.04,let's pretend that this is an
2665.839,4.121,advertisement we would like to display
2667.52,5.76,within our webpage i'll name this
2669.96,5.96,add.html so if you're using vs code to
2673.28,5.52,generate an html document a plain one
2675.92,4.64,type exclamation point then hit tab
2678.8,3.68,so let's say something
2680.56,5.279,i'll use an h1 header tag
2682.48,5.52,this is an advertisement
2685.839,4.561,and then close it uh let's change the
2688.0,3.68,background color too using the style
2690.4,3.84,attribute
2691.68,5.2,and i will pick the background color
2694.24,5.2,property and set this to maybe i don't
2696.88,4.56,know that color uh then let's change the
2699.44,4.0,width and height for the height maybe
2701.44,3.84,100
2703.44,4.159,then make sure to change your source as
2705.28,4.48,well so we need to list the relative
2707.599,3.841,file path since these files are right
2709.76,3.24,next to each other i only have to list
2711.44,5.52,the file name
2713.0,6.839,add.html save reload
2716.96,5.2,cool and there is my fake advertisement
2719.839,4.961,embedded pages do have a border this is
2722.16,4.0,how to remove that set the style
2724.8,5.519,attribute
2726.16,8.72,equal to the border css property and set
2730.319,7.28,this to zero so i'm going to save reload
2734.88,5.439,and this no longer has that border so
2737.599,4.801,yeah everybody those are iframes they're
2740.319,4.8,used to embed content from another
2742.4,4.959,source into an html document they're
2745.119,4.24,useful for advertisements and they're
2747.359,4.72,easily abused with a lot of hacking
2749.359,4.881,techniques so yeah those are iframes if
2752.079,3.841,you learn something new be sure to smash
2754.24,3.52,that like button drop a random comment
2755.92,3.679,down below and subscribe if you'd like
2757.76,4.0,to become a fellow bro
2759.599,3.921,what's going on everybody it's you bro
2761.76,3.2,hope you're doing well and in this video
2763.52,4.72,i'm going to show you how you can create
2764.96,6.159,a button using html so sit back relax
2768.24,2.879,and enjoy the show
2771.599,4.641,hey in this video i'm going to show you
2773.599,5.281,how we can create buttons using html
2776.24,4.24,we'll need a pair of button tags there's
2778.88,4.32,an opening button tag and a closing
2780.48,5.52,button tag here's our button to add some
2783.2,5.04,text between the button tags we can add
2786.0,3.2,whatever text we want to the button like
2788.24,2.96,click me
2789.2,3.6,you can set this up as a hyperlink when
2791.2,3.68,you click on the button to do so just
2792.8,3.6,surround your button element with a pair
2794.88,3.439,of a tags
2796.4,2.8,there's an opening a tag and a closing a
2798.319,3.76,tag
2799.2,6.08,and i will set the href attribute of the
2802.079,5.28,opening button tag to a url or relative
2805.28,7.36,file path of my choosing to make this
2807.359,5.281,simple let's set the url to google.com
2814.319,4.0,and then when i click on this button it
2816.16,4.88,takes me to google you can disable a
2818.319,5.201,button by adding a disabled boolean
2821.04,4.799,attribute to the opening button tag and
2823.52,4.48,we can no longer click on this button
2825.839,4.561,if you know a little bit of css you can
2828.0,5.28,add some css properties directly to a
2830.4,6.08,button by setting the style attribute
2833.28,5.28,equal to and list some css properties of
2836.48,4.48,your choosing let's change the
2838.56,5.999,background color
2840.96,6.639,you can pick a color name
2844.559,6.961,you can use rgb values
2847.599,3.921,or you can use hexadecimal values
2851.599,4.24,i think i'll set this to a dark gray
2854.0,3.28,color so maybe
2855.839,4.081,6 3s
2857.28,5.36,for rgb values and hexadecimal values
2859.92,5.12,you can always use a color picker online
2862.64,5.199,so if you would like to add multiple css
2865.04,5.44,properties separate each css property
2867.839,5.361,with a semicolon and next i will change
2870.48,5.2,the color that's the font color and
2873.2,6.08,maybe i'll pick green one color i like
2875.68,5.84,is zero zero ff zero zero that's just a
2879.28,5.039,bright green color you can also round
2881.52,5.76,these borders too by using the border
2884.319,5.601,radius property so again separate each
2887.28,5.68,css property with a semicolon
2889.92,5.679,and i will set the border radius
2892.96,3.92,property to 5 pixels just around the
2895.599,2.641,corners
2896.88,3.439,okay cool
2898.24,4.16,that's a pretty fancy looking button if
2900.319,5.201,i do say so myself and yep it still
2902.4,5.679,takes us to google just by us using html
2905.52,4.96,this adds structure to a webpage but it
2908.079,4.401,doesn't necessarily add functionality
2910.48,3.92,that's where a language like javascript
2912.48,4.079,comes in when we click on a button we
2914.4,4.159,can have this button execute some
2916.559,4.56,function from a javascript file i'll
2918.559,4.641,show you how we can create a very simple
2921.119,4.96,javascript program but of course we'll
2923.2,5.52,cover this more in the javascript series
2926.079,4.961,so let's get rid of this hyperlink
2928.72,3.92,and have our button do something else
2931.04,4.4,there is an on
2932.64,4.56,click attribute that we can set to a
2935.44,3.36,javascript function
2937.2,4.72,so we just place the name of the
2938.8,5.039,function between a set of double quotes
2941.92,3.679,we haven't created a javascript function
2943.839,4.801,yet but let's say that we'll have a
2945.599,4.561,javascript function named do something
2948.64,4.32,and then follow that name with a set of
2950.16,4.72,parentheses and let's create a paragraph
2952.96,5.52,element
2954.88,5.76,and we will say hello and then close it
2958.48,5.599,with this paragraph element i'm going to
2960.64,5.679,set the id attribute equal to let's say
2964.079,4.961,test here's how we can code a very
2966.319,5.601,simple javascript program you're going
2969.04,4.559,to create a pair of script tags there's
2971.92,3.76,an opening script tag and a closing
2973.599,4.881,script tag
2975.68,4.399,and within the script i will say
2978.48,3.04,function
2980.079,4.401,do something
2981.52,5.36,parentheses curly braces
2984.48,4.72,so this function will perform some
2986.88,4.56,subsection of code so when we click on
2989.2,5.68,our button what do we want this program
2991.44,4.399,to do we will take document dot
2994.88,1.959,get
2995.839,3.201,element
2996.839,3.561,by id
2999.04,4.319,parentheses
3000.4,4.24,list the id of our paragraph element
3003.359,2.24,test
3004.64,2.16,dot
3005.599,2.881,inner
3006.8,4.24,html
3008.48,4.16,and i will set the sequel to
3011.04,4.48,goodbye
3012.64,4.8,then add a semicolon at the end okay so
3015.52,4.88,when we click on this button it's going
3017.44,4.8,to execute this function do something
3020.4,4.32,and then perform whatever code is
3022.24,4.48,between this set of curly braces
3024.72,4.24,so you may need to save
3026.72,4.72,refresh your web page and if done
3028.96,4.8,correctly when you click on this button
3031.44,3.76,it will change this text
3033.76,2.72,from hello
3035.2,4.0,to goodbye
3036.48,5.119,so that is a very small javascript
3039.2,5.119,program so there is an on click
3041.599,5.041,attribute that you can set equal to a
3044.319,4.721,javascript function but of course we'll
3046.64,4.56,cover more about javascript well in the
3049.04,4.079,javascript playlist but that's one way
3051.2,3.919,in which you can add functionality to a
3053.119,4.081,button in this video we were more
3055.119,4.24,focused on actually creating the button
3057.2,4.159,itself so yeah if this video helped you
3059.359,3.681,out you can help me out by smashing that
3061.359,3.441,like button leave a random comment down
3063.04,5.039,below and subscribe if you'd like to
3064.8,4.96,become a fellow bro
3068.079,3.76,hey everyone i'm going to try and
3069.76,4.0,explain everything i can about forms in
3071.839,4.161,about eight minutes to create a form
3073.76,3.76,element we'll need a pair of form tags
3076.0,3.28,there's an opening form tag and a
3077.52,3.76,closing form tag and depending on the
3079.28,4.319,user input that you need there is an
3081.28,4.72,input element and you can set the type
3083.599,4.401,attribute to whatever you need let's say
3086.0,4.319,we need some text from a user like a
3088.0,4.079,first name within our form there is a
3090.319,3.52,text box where we can enter in some user
3092.079,3.441,information so we should probably let
3093.839,4.321,the user know what we want them to type
3095.52,5.12,in i will precede this input element
3098.16,5.84,with a label
3100.64,5.52,let's say first name and a user can type
3104.0,4.48,in their first name now it is considered
3106.16,4.959,good practice to fill out a for
3108.48,5.2,attribute within the label and set this
3111.119,4.72,to whatever you want let's say fname and
3113.68,5.679,within the associated input elements i
3115.839,5.841,will set the id also equal to fname
3119.359,4.561,whatever's within the four attribute
3121.68,5.12,this does a couple things one if i was
3123.92,5.52,to click on this label this will select
3126.8,4.64,my input box it's also helpful for
3129.44,4.159,people that are using screen readers so
3131.44,4.8,that they can easily navigate your form
3133.599,4.881,there is also a name attribute when we
3136.24,4.0,submit this data what sort of name do we
3138.48,4.16,want to give that data think of it like
3140.24,4.72,a variable i will also name this fname
3142.64,4.64,as well within the input element there
3144.96,4.56,is a placeholder to display some default
3147.28,5.279,text to a user by setting the
3149.52,5.52,placeholder attribute equal to some text
3152.559,4.721,like spongebob so if i was to click
3155.04,3.68,within this input field and type
3157.28,3.6,something that will get rid of my
3158.72,3.92,placeholder let's create an input field
3160.88,4.4,for a last name and really we can just
3162.64,4.8,copy this and make a few changes to it
3165.28,4.96,so copy both the label and the input
3167.44,4.879,element uh let's change this from first
3170.24,4.64,name to last name
3172.319,5.361,change four as well to lname
3174.88,4.0,id will be lname and let's make name l
3177.68,3.52,name as well
3178.88,3.439,and the placeholder how about square
3181.2,2.879,pants
3182.319,4.081,these labels and input elements will
3184.079,4.24,appear on the same line to separate them
3186.4,4.24,and treat them as block level elements i
3188.319,6.121,will add each of these pairs to their
3190.64,3.8,own div element
3196.24,5.2,perhaps i'll add a line break as well
3199.359,4.801,okay now with forms there are built-in
3201.44,2.72,buttons too
3204.96,6.48,we will set the input type equal to
3208.559,5.04,reset so if i were to type in some text
3211.44,4.32,and click reset that will reset
3213.599,5.121,whatever's within my form and there is a
3215.76,6.0,submit button as well
3218.72,4.8,i will set the type equal to submit so
3221.76,4.319,currently our data doesn't have any
3223.52,4.64,place to go to so if i were to click the
3226.079,4.48,submit button this data is not going to
3228.16,5.04,go anywhere so if i need to send this
3230.559,4.881,data to a page i will list that page
3233.2,4.32,within the action attribute of my
3235.44,3.919,opening form element
3237.52,4.48,so we'll need the help of a dynamic
3239.359,3.921,programming language php for example
3242.0,2.88,we're not going to focus on
3243.28,3.76,functionality in this video but rather
3244.88,3.52,the structure of a form so if i need to
3247.04,4.559,send this to
3248.4,5.36,a php page i will list that php page
3251.599,4.72,within the action attribute there is
3253.76,6.48,also an associated method attribute two
3256.319,6.401,common values are get and post
3260.24,5.359,get is considered insecure it's going to
3262.72,5.119,append your data to the url of your web
3265.599,4.48,page so for example if i set the method
3267.839,5.201,to get and type in some information
3270.079,5.841,and click submit it's going to append my
3273.04,4.88,data to the end of my url so it's going
3275.92,4.08,to add a question mark then all of my
3277.92,4.32,data if you need to submit some secure
3280.0,4.16,information like a password do not use
3282.24,4.4,get i would say that this is useful for
3284.16,4.48,things like search boxes if a user needs
3286.64,4.0,to navigate your web page for maybe some
3288.64,4.56,sort of keyword so it's better to use
3290.64,3.84,post to submit some secure information
3293.2,3.04,but this isn't going to do anything
3294.48,4.4,obviously because we do not have a
3296.24,4.48,server set up now there is a required
3298.88,3.12,boolean attribute you can add if
3300.72,4.0,somebody needs to submit some
3302.0,4.88,information they are required to fill
3304.72,4.48,out any input elements that have this
3306.88,3.76,boolean attribute of required so if i
3309.2,3.52,just attempt to submit this without
3310.64,4.159,typing in anything there is a small
3312.72,4.0,pop-up box that says please fill out
3314.799,3.76,this field all right i'm going to go
3316.72,3.599,kind of quick through these next input
3318.559,4.401,elements just because i think we have
3320.319,5.601,the hang of the general context of input
3322.96,5.52,elements so next we have password fields
3325.92,4.56,you set the type equal to password so if
3328.48,4.319,somebody types in characters they will
3330.48,5.2,be hidden if you need to set a max size
3332.799,5.201,of your password there is a max length
3335.68,4.32,attribute let's set this to maybe 12 so
3338.0,3.92,we can type in no more than 12
3340.0,4.4,characters for a password and you can
3341.92,3.36,also add that required boolean attribute
3344.4,3.84,too
3345.28,5.68,for an email element set the type equal
3348.24,2.72,to email
3351.44,4.8,in order to submit an email we need an
3353.92,4.24,at character within our email otherwise
3356.24,4.559,we cannot submit this information and
3358.16,4.959,perhaps i'll add a placeholder as well
3360.799,3.28,placeholder equals s
3363.119,3.601,pants
3364.079,5.04,at gmail.com
3366.72,4.399,so there is our placeholder for a
3369.119,4.561,telephone number you're going to set the
3371.119,5.361,type equal to tell
3373.68,5.28,and i do have a placeholder as well if
3376.48,6.0,you need the user to type in a date like
3378.96,5.44,a birth date there is a type date which
3382.48,3.68,includes an interactive calendar to
3384.4,4.0,select a date
3386.16,4.399,a user can type in a number if you set
3388.4,4.0,the type equal to number let's say that
3390.559,3.841,the user is buying something from a
3392.4,4.32,store there are some arrows where they
3394.4,4.08,can increase or decrease the quantity
3396.72,3.2,but we should probably place some limits
3398.48,3.68,they can type in basically whatever
3399.92,3.76,number they want they want negative one
3402.16,3.6,billion items
3403.68,5.439,so we can set the min and the max i'll
3405.76,6.16,set the min equal to 0 and of the max
3409.119,4.96,equal to what about 99
3411.92,4.879,and you can also set a default value too
3414.079,4.641,i'll set the default value equal to 1.
3416.799,3.921,next we have radio buttons with radio
3418.72,4.16,buttons we can only select one radio
3420.72,4.48,button from any one group perhaps we'll
3422.88,5.199,have the user select a title are they a
3425.2,5.28,mr a miss or a doctor
3428.079,5.681,so i'm going to create a pair of labels
3430.48,5.76,and input for each option that we have
3433.76,3.52,so we will have a mr option
3436.24,2.2,miss
3437.28,5.36,and
3438.44,6.679,phd okay i will set the input type equal
3442.64,5.04,to radio and then do that with each of
3445.119,4.881,these pairs
3447.68,4.8,so we can select more than one because
3450.0,4.4,these are all not within the same group
3452.48,3.68,to set them all within the same group we
3454.4,3.28,will all have them have the same
3456.16,4.56,matching name
3457.68,5.04,let's say that the name will be title
3460.72,3.839,so therefore we can only select one now
3462.72,3.52,since they're all within the same group
3464.559,3.921,and that's kind of the idea behind radio
3466.24,5.599,buttons you can only select one and we
3468.48,6.319,will set an associated value of let's
3471.839,4.96,say mister for the first value
3474.799,4.641,misses for the second
3476.799,4.401,and doctor for the last one
3479.44,5.28,then i'm just going to precede all of
3481.2,6.32,these with a separate label
3484.72,5.359,uh let's say title
3487.52,5.12,and i will set the four attribute equal
3490.079,4.24,to title and within each of these radio
3492.64,3.6,button labels when i click on one of
3494.319,4.161,these labels i also want to be able to
3496.24,4.319,select one of these radio buttons so i
3498.48,5.28,will set the for attribute equal to a
3500.559,5.921,unique id so let's say mister
3503.76,5.92,the id will be mister
3506.48,3.2,and repeat the same steps
3513.359,3.76,okay so when we click on these labels we
3515.44,2.72,should be able to select our radio
3517.119,4.0,buttons
3518.16,5.439,nice with drop down menus instead of a
3521.119,4.881,type we are going to use a pair of
3523.599,4.801,select tags so there's an opening select
3526.0,4.72,tag and a closing select tag and we list
3528.4,4.719,individual options within the select
3530.72,4.32,element
3533.119,4.401,we'll give our user three options from
3535.04,6.24,this drop down menu they can pay with a
3537.52,7.96,visa a mastercard or a gift card
3541.28,4.2,and i will give each of these a value
3547.92,4.48,okay we now have a payment field and the
3550.48,3.28,user can select an option from this drop
3552.4,3.199,down menu
3553.76,5.12,and the last input type i will explain
3555.599,5.281,in this video is the checkbox type so
3558.88,3.84,let's say we have a subscribe button and
3560.88,3.84,you can go ahead and smash that
3562.72,4.96,subscribe button so just set the type
3564.72,5.04,equal to checkbox for well a checkbox
3567.68,4.08,well yeah everybody that's how to create
3569.76,4.079,an html form there's still some more
3571.76,3.839,advanced input types we did not cover
3573.839,3.681,but these are the very basics i would
3575.599,3.681,say if you found this video helpful
3577.52,3.599,please remember to smash that like
3579.28,3.6,button leave a random comment down below
3581.119,5.081,and subscribe if you'd like to become a
3582.88,3.32,fellow bro
3599.76,2.079,you
