3.52,4.96,and in this video we are going to
5.68,4.64,discuss a simplified introduction to the
8.48,4.319,computer system
10.32,5.12,this video tutorial is specially
12.799,6.001,designed for the beginners to learn the
15.44,6.4,fundamental concepts related to computer
18.8,5.76,we will study the definition of computer
21.84,4.88,various components of computer system
24.56,6.08,important characteristics and features
26.72,6.8,of computer and how computer works
30.64,5.12,let us start with a simple introduction
33.52,4.719,to the computer system
35.76,5.2,a computer system is defined as a
38.239,5.84,programmable electronics device that can
40.96,5.759,be programmed to accept the input data
44.079,4.8,then process this input data as per the
46.719,4.48,program instructions
48.879,5.601,the computer then presents the processed
51.199,6.0,data to the user as an output
54.48,4.96,the user can utilize the process data
57.199,4.961,for some meaningful work
59.44,5.6,the computer system mainly consists of
62.16,5.999,two types of components the first type
65.04,5.8,is called the hardware components and
68.159,5.601,the second type is called the software
70.84,5.4,components the hardware components are
73.76,6.8,the physical parts of the computer such
76.24,7.28,as keyboard display monitor mouse cpu
80.56,5.68,cabinet and other such parts
83.52,5.36,the computer system needs two types of
86.24,5.36,software components to function
88.88,6.08,the first type is called the application
91.6,5.519,software and the second type is called
94.96,4.56,the system software
97.119,4.801,the application software is directly
99.52,5.44,used by the system user to perform
101.92,6.96,different tasks on the computer
104.96,7.119,such as microsoft ward and powerpoint
108.88,5.919,whereas the system software is a special
112.079,5.281,type of software that is internally used
114.799,5.521,by the computer itself to manage and
117.36,5.119,operate the various hardware components
120.32,4.399,connected to the system
122.479,4.881,the operating system is the most
124.719,4.001,important system software used by the
127.36,4.239,computer
128.72,5.44,the operating system basically provides
131.599,4.241,an interface to the user to interact
134.16,4.48,with the system
135.84,5.119,let us now understand the architecture
138.64,4.239,of the computer system in terms of the
140.959,4.241,functional units
142.879,5.041,the entire functioning of the computer
145.2,4.08,can be grouped into various functional
147.92,3.76,units
149.28,4.88,let us understand some important
151.68,4.32,functional units of the computer system
154.16,3.28,with the help of a computer block
156.0,3.36,diagram
157.44,5.2,the computer system working can be
159.36,6.48,grouped into four major units
162.64,5.599,each unit performs a specific function
165.84,4.479,in the working of a computer
168.239,5.36,the four major units of the computer
170.319,6.881,units are first input unit
173.599,5.121,second memory unit third central
177.2,4.64,processing unit
178.72,6.48,also commonly referred to as cpu and the
181.84,6.0,fourth unit is called output unit
185.2,5.119,the input unit consists of various input
187.84,5.92,devices connected to the computer system
190.319,5.601,such as keyboard mouse scanner
193.76,4.559,the main function of the input unit is
195.92,4.239,to accept the data received from the
198.319,4.961,input devices
200.159,5.521,the next unit is called memory unit the
203.28,4.64,computer memory unit consists of
205.68,4.16,different types of memories used to
207.92,4.08,store the data and the program
209.84,3.679,instructions during the program
212.0,4.0,execution
213.519,5.44,the computer uses different types of
216.0,6.4,memories such as disk memory random
218.959,7.041,access memory called ram cache memory
222.4,6.0,and the cpu memory registers
226.0,5.519,the next unit of the computer is called
228.4,5.759,the central processing unit and it is
231.519,6.161,abbreviated as cpu
234.159,6.64,the cpu is also commonly referred to as
237.68,6.08,processor or a microprocessor
240.799,5.201,the cpu is the brain of the computer and
243.76,4.08,provides the processing power to the
246.0,4.4,computer system
247.84,5.2,the main function of the cpu is to
250.4,4.559,execute the computer program
253.04,4.879,the fourth unit of the computer is
254.959,5.52,called the output unit the output unit
257.919,5.28,consists of various output devices
260.479,5.761,connected to the computer system such as
263.199,5.28,display monitor printer projector and
266.24,4.8,other output devices
268.479,4.881,the main function of the output unit is
271.04,4.8,to present the processed data by the
273.36,5.119,computer all right so far we have
275.84,4.16,discussed various functional units of
278.479,4.081,the computer
280.0,5.12,let us now move on to the next topic
282.56,4.32,that is important characteristics of the
285.12,4.639,computer system
286.88,4.48,the computer system has four important
289.759,5.281,characteristics
291.36,8.64,these characteristics are first speed
295.04,8.159,second accuracy third storage fourth
300.0,5.68,fast decisions and fifth ability to
303.199,4.801,perform repeated tasks
305.68,5.28,the computer can operate at very high
308.0,5.52,speed the computers can also operate
310.96,4.0,with remarkable accuracy without any
313.52,4.0,mistake
314.96,5.44,the computer also provides different
317.52,5.119,types of storage devices to store the
320.4,4.72,large volumes of data
322.639,5.041,the processor inside the computer is
325.12,5.04,designed to take fast decisions as per
327.68,4.56,the program instructions
330.16,4.64,similarly the computer can work
332.24,5.12,continuously and repetitively perform
334.8,3.6,the programmed operations without any
337.36,3.6,break
338.4,4.639,let us now move on to the next topic
340.96,3.92,that is important features of the
343.039,4.081,computer system
344.88,3.28,the computer system has some important
347.12,4.16,features
348.16,5.92,these features are first the computer as
351.28,5.039,a programmable the term programmable
354.08,4.48,means each task performed by the
356.319,3.921,computer is directed by the set of
358.56,4.639,instructions
360.24,4.88,this set of instructions is called as a
363.199,3.921,computer program
365.12,4.639,the computer program directs the
367.12,4.4,computer system to perform specific
369.759,4.16,operations
371.52,4.799,in other words the computer will perform
373.919,4.161,the task only as per the program
376.319,4.72,instructions
378.08,5.6,second the computer is used to process
381.039,5.6,the data the data processing is one of
383.68,6.0,the most common use of the computers
386.639,5.441,the computer process the raw data and
389.68,4.72,produces the information
392.08,5.04,the data cannot be meaningfully used in
394.4,5.28,the raw form the raw data needs to be
397.12,4.96,first converted to processed data so
399.68,5.359,that it can be used for some meaningful
402.08,4.72,work such as decision making within an
405.039,4.56,organization
406.8,5.519,third the computer as digital electronic
409.599,5.201,machine the computer is called a digital
412.319,4.961,electronic machine because it contains
414.8,4.56,electronic components and
417.28,3.44,computer needs an electric current to
419.36,3.679,operate
420.72,5.44,the term digital simply means the
423.039,6.481,computer understands the language of
426.16,5.039,only zero and one called the binary
429.52,4.079,number system
431.199,5.84,the computer can understand and execute
433.599,5.921,instructions written only in binary
437.039,5.28,these instructions are called machine
439.52,6.399,instructions the machine instructions in
442.319,7.121,binary consist of only two numeric
445.919,6.0,numbers that is either zero or one
449.44,5.84,the cpu can execute the program
451.919,6.321,instructions encoded in machine language
455.28,5.6,the machine instructions consist of
458.24,6.079,sequence of only two numeric numbers
460.88,6.56,that is either zero or 1.
464.319,6.0,the binary code is also referred to as
467.44,5.52,machine code or machine language
470.319,5.28,the computer's microprocessor works as a
472.96,5.919,brain the processor performs all the
475.599,5.841,arithmetic calculations and also handles
478.879,5.04,the logical operations
481.44,4.8,the program compilation is another
483.919,5.521,important fundamental concept related to
486.24,5.679,the computer that you should be aware of
489.44,4.72,the computer programs are written using
491.919,4.96,any high-level human-readable
494.16,4.96,programming language such as c language
496.879,4.561,java and python
499.12,5.68,however the computer processor can
501.44,5.759,decode and execute instructions only in
504.8,4.88,machine code in binary
507.199,4.641,so it doesn't really matter in which
509.68,4.159,high-level programming language you
511.84,4.559,write the program code because
513.839,4.961,eventually all high-level computer
516.399,5.12,programs must be first converted to
518.8,5.68,low-level machine code in binary that
521.519,5.601,cpu can directly execute
524.48,4.96,the compiler is used to translate the
527.12,4.719,high-level program into low-level
529.44,4.88,machine code in binary
531.839,5.521,this conversion process is called the
534.32,5.519,program compilation for more information
