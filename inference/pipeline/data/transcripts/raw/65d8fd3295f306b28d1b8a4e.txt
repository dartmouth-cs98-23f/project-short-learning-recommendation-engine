hello everyone welcome to another
episode
and today we have devon chatterjee a
predictive analytics consultant at
lasalle network
and today we're speaking more about the
topic of quantum computing and data
science for it
so welcome to the show devon i'm such a
pleasure to have you today
hi hi catherine and thanks for having me
on the program yeah absolutely
could you tell the audience just more
about where you're coming from
and your background and just what led
you to your role today
sure uh so i majored in physics and went
to
university of new mexico to study
quantum information processing that was
around 2000 2001
i studied under people like murray
gilman from there
i went to university of chicago to study
math and computer science
then on to iit to work on my phd in
analytics where
my dissertation topic was hedge fund
replication with deep neural networks
and generative adversarial networks
when i was in chicago i started working
in systems engineering
and because of my analytics background i
started doing analytics
within it and that was before data
science was even mainstream
so my last position was as a senior data
scientist in a cyber security group
now i'm consulting helping a company on
their
digital transformation journey to
improve their
quality and governance and expand their
analytics capabilities
in addition i've taught business
analytics and data science
at iit in northeastern illinois
university and i'm currently a course
developer and adjunct professor
in business analytics at indiana tech
yeah that's awesome so you're clearly
doing a lot of different things
in the data field right now yeah
and so what do you think are some
similarities and differences that you've
seen in
quantum computing and data science since
i'm sure there's a lot of
overlap between these two areas there's
actually
probably not um that's yeah people might
think that but there's actually mostly
differences between the two fields
as far as similarities i would say both
areas are you know expanding due to
advances in technology but there's also
like a prevalent lack of understanding
of both topics
mostly quantum computing since it's so
much newer than data science
but anyone experiencing the uses of you
know machine learning and ai
at mainly as like buzzwords for example
can fully appreciate that comment now
quantum computing
is one part of a broader quantum
technology umbrella similar to ai
being you know like under machine
learning but
in quantum computing there's things like
quantum key distribution
post quantum cryptography quantum
software quantum materials
one idea was to utilize quantum
mechanics
in a computer to speed up the
computation of complex
problems like those in optimization and
finance and biology
and eventually machine learning and ai
so there's currently some research in
the area of quantum machine learning
and ai now some of the differences are
that data science you know obviously
uses classical computers
which uses bits you know zeros and ones
to perform the operations
quantum computers use quantum bits or q
bits
to process the data so due to their
basis in quantum mechanics qubits can be
in both
a zero and a one state simultaneously
due to a concept called superposition so
these
and other aspects of quantum mechanics
will allow quantum computers to obtain
what's called
quantum supremacy over classical
computers quantum supremacy
is where a quantum computer can solve a
problem much faster than a classical
computer
so the more complex the problem the
better a quantum computer will actually
be
at solving it faster right google
has actually claimed to achieve quantum
supremacy in
back in 2019 it was around october
november of 2019.
now before that the progression of
quantum computing had been
essentially linear but now it's like
exponential
so there's new participants entering
that field every year
whether it's startups r d or developing
hardware
some other differences between the two
are
in the knowledge required so data
science mainly requires
you know as you know like knowledge of
statistics econometrics programming
visualization tools
but quantum computing requires knowledge
of quantum mechanics and matrix theory
to start with so at this point i would
also probably say that knowledge of
quantum hardware materials and
architectures are also needed
since there's a few contending
approaches to quantum computing
like ibm's gate-based solution and
d-wave's annealing-based solution
so really data science is a way to use
statistics visualizations and machine
learning and ai algorithms
to create solutions to problems and get
more answers from the
ever-increasing amounts of data that
exist whereas
quantum computing is mainly a technology
based on quantum mechanics
that will help solve those problems
significantly
faster and push past the current
computational limits
when doing data science on those
classical computers
it sounds like from just your
explanation here it sounds like they can
come hand in hand with each other as
well and they can really complement each
other
also um even despite you know their
differences right
yes absolutely they're you know quantum
computing is
mainly for you know speeding up those
types of problems which
machine learning and ai models and
algorithms
help solve right in a better way than
some other things like think
think deep neural networks right
although you know deep neural networks
is a black box but
quantum computing i think is probably
even more
obscure and unknown as to how that works
it's a little bit more difficult even
but
yes definitely uh quantum computing will
be able to
work hand-in-hand at that point in the
future with
you know machine learning and ai you
know with data science yeah absolutely
and
for these two topics how are they kind
of being used in the it world today
everyone kind of knows that data science
has a number of business use cases
but it also has a number of use cases in
it
so when hearing about data science i
think most people tend to think of
business applications like marketing
health care
claims finance etc right but data
science applications in iet and cyber
security
are comparatively newer application
areas
in cyber security the main use cases are
things like anomaly detection
behavioral analytics attack
classification or prediction
predicting distributed denial of service
attacks and privileged user analytics
right
and one of the big issues or the
probably the biggest issues i found
was that data is not as easily
structured
as it is on the business side you know
within cyber security and i t
and since cyber security leadership
tends to be you know people with
you know backgrounds and security but
not much
background in big data and data science
then they need to trust the data
scientists and data engineers to be the
data experts
right just like on the business side now
in it
outside of cyber security there's use
cases that
that may not be typically implemented at
most companies
one example from my last position was
using machine learning to create
a probability risk score for change
management so here we used historical
features of changes
incidents and configuration information
from infrastructure
to help determine a risk score for new
changes
and their risk of causing an outage so
the model
used logistic regression to create the
risk score
if that score was above a certain
threshold the it
change management team could put it on
hold they could reschedule it
require additional information and
sign-offs things like that
so this actually had a realized savings
associated with it
due to the cost avoidance of outages and
i'm doing something similar to this for
the company i'm currently consulting for
as well
now for quantum computing it's actually
too
new to have current applications in
business or it
but there is a lot of r d happening in
this area right now
for example well goldman sachs recently
said that they
expected to be utilizing quantum
applications within the next three to
five years
anthem is currently developing practical
quantum computing applications to
enhance the
consumer healthcare experience but
personally my opinion is
i think that quantum programs and
applications
will take a little bit longer like maybe
in the seven to ten year time frame
because it's that crawl walk run
scenario where
you know everyone tends to focus more on
the walk and run phases right so
but they're still definitely in that
crawl phase so
there's some some work that needs to be
done still but
however i want to point out a caveat to
that is
one area of quantum technology that will
definitely be relevant within the next
three to five years
is quantum security so within that time
quantum computing will pose a threat to
the security built into every company's
it systems
state-sponsored quantum computing
hacking labs already exist
and if a company's existing encrypted
data
is compromised a threat actor can
actually hold onto that data
and unencrypt it when the quantum
technology is available so
last fall i created a quantum risk
presentation for our company ciso or the
chief information security officer
at that time there was a survey that
determined that about
half of it leaders viewed quantum
computing as a threat
but 71 percent of them said that they
thought it would be a threat within the
next three years
and this was last year so companies need
to look at transitioning to what are
called
quantum safe solutions there's a number
of vendors already offering these
solutions but the first thing that
companies will need to do is perform
a quantum risk assessment then evaluate
vendors
and quantum safe products and then
develop some internal knowledge on
quantum technology also finally you know
you have to keep track of the
developments in quantum computing and
quantum key distribution and quantum
safe solutions
so that's mainly how quantum computing
i feel would be utilized then within it
in the near future
yeah definitely and i think that's such
an interesting insight to kind of think
about for the future as well with
everything really growing in this
technology field right now is there any
interesting projects that you'd like to
talk about that
you were able to utilize content
computing yeah well
so far the only projects i've worked on
have been part of you know workshops
textbooks or other online sources i
started getting back into quantum
information processing a few years ago
when i ran my first
quantum program using quiz kit on ibm
q which is ibm's quantum computer you
know since then i've obtained
some professional certifications in
quantum technology
attended a number of workshops worked on
some programming projects on topics like
quantum tomography super dense coding
swapping quantum states and quantum
teleportation so some interesting
projects involving some programming but
in addition i'm also connected to
founder of a startup in chicago
called chicago quantum so last year they
used d-waves
quantum computers which is a quantum
annealing computer
to do portfolio optimization and they
published a paper on that last july
since my dissertation is on hedge fund
replication and i use a factor-based
approach
to creating the portfolios i'm
particularly interested in their work
so at some point i would like to
replicate what they did and possibly
apply it to my research topic as well
but outside of those types of things
there's
really not it's not like in data science
where you have
you know a bunch of stuff on udemy or
wherever and and you can you know find a
bunch of projects you know on github or
whatever so
it's kind of limited as far as projects
really into quantum computing
yeah definitely and i know that you
would also mention that quantum
computing is
kind of a relatively newer field that's
um emerging right now
and what have been some resources that
you've taken a look at just to help you
with your
journey with learning more about this
specific niche
sure um well i mean you know we're
talking about data science
too but those are obvious there's lots
of sources available for data science
outside of the university courses like i
mentioned udemy coursera udacity
even facebook groups right and i've
utilized all of those at some point so
it really
depends on for data science it really
depends on you know where you are in
your data science journey as to what
resources you need
for quantum computing there's not as
much available so aside from university
courses in things like quantum mechanics
there and quantum information processing
there's not
a lot of institutions offering programs
for example in quantum computing yet so
it's kind of like where data science was
about 10 years ago or 12 years ago
something like that
there's a number of seminars conferences
and workshops out there
you just have to look a little harder to
find them but if someone's interested in
learning
more about quantum computing or quantum
technology in general like i would
suggest
starting there and expanding your
resources and connections
from there and that that's essentially
how i approached it
yeah no i think that's great and i
wanted to say thank you so much devon
for joining us today on the show
we the data standard are trying to build
a community where everyone can just
network and collaborate with each other
so what is something that you're kind of
looking for out of the community here
a couple of things i think first i would
certainly be interested in networking
collaborating sharing ideas with anybody
who's interested in these topics
second i've worked on quantum technology
risk evaluations and road maps
in cyber security so if anyone is
interested in
learning more about that or doing that
within our company you know feel free to
contact me for that as well
yeah perfect and uh where can everyone
find you online just to connect with you
well probably the best place would be
linkedin you know for anyone interested
you can reach out to me on linkedin and
and i i
you know monitor that you know regularly
so perfect
and uh to our audience for more
information on the data standard you can
find us at www.datastandard.io
as well as on our linkedin and youtube
channel thank you so much devon for
joining us it was so great to have you
