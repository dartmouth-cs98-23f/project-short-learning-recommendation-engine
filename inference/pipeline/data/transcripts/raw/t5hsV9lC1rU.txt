0.0,1.198,Hello Friends!
1.398,0.941,Welcome to Gate Smashers
2.539,2.703,So the topic is Transactions
5.442,1.15,Transaction is actually what
6.792,1.431,It is a set of operations
8.423,1.477,Used to perform
10.1,1.947,A logical unit of work
12.247,2.701,This is a definition of Transaction
15.148,2.36,But as we listen transaction word
17.708,2.204,What is the first thing that comes into our mind?
20.112,0.617,Transaction
20.929,1.641,Give and take money
22.77,2.203,Means we are transferring money from here and there
25.173,1.307,We are withdrawing
26.68,1.042,Debit or credit
27.922,0.5,Yes
28.607,2.826,That is the basic meaning of transaction
31.633,2.031,But it is not the only meaning of transaction
33.864,1.181,Any transaction
35.245,2.127,We are changing anything in database
37.572,2.189,We are reading database
39.961,2.103,That is also a part of transaction
42.264,2.575,But the main motive of what is transaction
45.039,0.922,Yes
46.161,0.907,It is monetary transaction
47.268,4.51,Means we want to transfer money from one account to another account
51.978,2.197,Or I want to withdraw money
54.375,1.826,Or I want to credit the amount
56.401,1.808,That is the basic meaning of transaction
58.409,3.055,But whenever we perform any transaction
61.664,2.025,Why do we perform transaction
63.889,2.014,Basically what we have to do
66.103,1.257,We have to get some work done
67.56,1.363,That only I have written over here
69.123,1.234,It is set of operation
70.557,1.973,Used to perform
72.73,1.586,A logical unit of work
74.516,1.683,"Work means, task"
76.399,1.424,We have to perform task
78.023,2.413,We will do a simple example of transaction
80.636,2.125,Which almost all of you have faced
82.961,2.422,That is a transaction from a ATM
85.583,2.826,When we withdraw money from ATM
88.609,1.558,It is a transaction
90.367,1.608,What is written at last?
92.175,2.036,Your transaction is completed successfully
94.411,2.6,"Means, what we have done"
97.211,6.356,"Whenever we withdraw money from ATM, we have to perform set of operations"
103.767,1.497,And what is my task?
105.464,0.929,What is my work?
106.593,3.206,Over there what is my work? what is my task?
109.999,0.92,Withdraw
111.119,2.296,Withdraw money
113.615,1.652,This is my task
115.467,3.105,"But, to perform this task"
118.772,2.7,I will have to perform some set of operations
121.672,1.6,What are that set of operations?
123.472,2.349,First of all I inserted the card
126.021,1.933,So I inserted the card
128.154,1.212,Then what is happening at backend?
129.566,0.951,The information
130.717,1.629,That is being read
132.546,2.985,My details corresponding to my card
135.731,1.451,That machine is reading
137.382,2.495,So that from my account
140.077,1.852,It can fetch the information
142.129,1.517,That how much balance is there in the account
143.846,1.423,Is this person authentic?
145.469,0.5,Or not
146.154,1.891,So after that what do we write
148.245,1.179,I choose a language
149.624,1.779,After choosing the language
151.603,1.878,We generally select the account
153.681,2.148,That from saving account or current account or what
156.029,1.36,Generally saving account
157.589,3.655,After saving account next it comes that how much money you want to withdraw
161.444,1.662,That money I entered
163.306,0.835,After that
164.341,1.111,It asks me pin
165.652,1.884,So I entered 4 digit pin
167.736,1.975,And then wait for the money
169.911,0.997,After that money
171.108,1.22,Comes from the machine
172.528,2.576,And your transaction is completed
175.304,3.204,And you will get message on your registered mobile number
178.708,2.656,So these 7-8 operations that we have performed
181.564,3.135,What is this 7-8 operations collection called?
184.899,1.065,Transaction
186.164,3.797,But it is not necessary that whatever you are doing from ATM is only transaction
190.161,0.941,Even if online
191.302,4.515,If you are transferring money online from one account to another
196.017,1.508,That is also a type of transaction
197.725,1.727,For that also there are some set of operations
199.652,1.167,What? first of all
201.019,1.039,Authentication
202.258,1.118,You on the browser
203.576,0.783,You filled SBI online
204.559,1.941,You filled username and password
206.7,1.541,What is the first operation?
208.441,2.612,"You have to authenticate, that you are valid or not"
211.253,3.013,So as it will come to know that username and password is matched
214.466,1.489,So server said that yes
216.155,1.207,Now you can do the transaction
217.562,1.746,Then you selected the beneficiary
219.508,3.644,Then after that if beneficiary is already added
223.352,1.981,Then it is good otherwise you will add
225.533,4.0,And after that you will fill the amount to be transferred
229.733,0.561,After that
230.494,1.111,OTP will come
231.805,1.583,And  you will fill transaction password
233.588,1.398,And your money
235.186,3.462,Transaction will be successfully completed
238.848,2.08,So what is the actually meaning of transaction?
241.128,3.507,When we are performing set of operations
244.835,1.464,And what will happen with that?
246.499,3.289,"Work, some work will be done"
249.988,1.759,So if we talk about database
251.947,1.245,In database we generally
253.392,1.251,What are we telling transaction?
254.843,2.351,That we are generally
257.394,1.614,How are we defining transaction
259.208,3.118,Transaction generally represent a change in database
262.526,2.87,To make some change in database
265.596,0.882,What do we perform
266.678,0.966,Transaction
267.844,2.949,And all the banking systems are there
270.993,3.116,If we are taking monterrey examples
274.309,1.479,Then what these banks have done
275.988,0.794,They have made database
276.982,3.738,They have a database of all the account holders
280.92,3.483,"Where our information, detail, how much money is there"
284.603,1.699,"Whole amount, everything is there"
286.502,1.8,Whenever we will do transaction
288.502,1.495,What will happen at first
290.197,2.318,That information will be fetched from there
292.715,3.067,And then we will perform some change in that
295.982,1.49,So in transaction
297.672,2.081,If we talk about operations
299.953,1.912,Which are the operations
302.065,1.773,So in database the transaction that is there
304.038,1.676,In that there are 2 operations
305.914,2.388,Read and write
310.311,2.954,These are 2 operations
313.465,1.29,The major operations
314.955,1.258,Which comes in the
316.413,0.922,Transaction
317.535,1.397,Read and Write
319.132,0.837,Read means
320.169,2.478,We have to read database
322.847,1.078,Where is the data?
324.125,1.967,Where is data and table?
326.292,0.851,In hard disk
327.343,0.823,In servers
328.366,2.524,At backend the servers that we have
333.451,1.556,If I talk about database server
337.54,0.905,Then in database server
338.645,2.478,All the data where is it kept in backend?
341.323,1.526,On drives
343.049,2.029,On hard drives
345.278,2.44,So user is requesting
347.918,1.236,From different places
349.354,1.921,User is requesting
351.475,0.887,To server
352.562,1.555,That I want to read the data
354.317,1.427,Over here there is all the data kept
355.944,3.18,All the account holders data is over here
359.324,1.452,So as user
360.976,2.733,Uses an API an application
363.909,1.419,Will access server
365.528,1.109,It will request server
366.837,2.712,That  I want to perform particular transaction
369.749,1.806,Let's say I want to transfer
371.755,1.959,I want to transfer amount
373.914,4.22,If I want to transfer amount from account A to account B
378.334,1.308,Then first of all
379.842,2.524,I should know the information of account A
382.566,2.18,That much money are there in account A
384.946,2.265,Who is actually owner of account A
387.411,2.958,So for that first of all we send request to server
390.569,2.065,That is when we fill our username password
392.834,2.636,That is a kind of request to server
395.67,2.141,When username password is authenticated
398.011,2.673,An interface will be open in front of me
400.884,2.418,"What we do in that interface, we transfer"
403.502,1.207,As we transferred
404.909,2.47,Our information is read
407.579,0.901,What is read?
408.68,3.7,We are reading the information from database
412.58,1.551,"Only, read"
414.331,3.817,"Access, which we call as we are accessing database"
420.687,1.583,When we will access database
422.47,3.26,After that only we can perform some write
425.93,1.163,What is the meaning of write
427.293,1.034,Change
430.73,1.53,What is the meaning of write? change
432.46,1.226,What is the meaning of read
433.886,1.251,Just accessing the data
435.337,0.774,We just have to see the data
436.311,3.87,But the meaning of write is to make some change in the data
440.381,3.426,So if we write a normal transaction in database
444.007,1.924,How we will write the transaction
446.131,2.135,What is the way of writing that
448.466,1.907,First of all
450.573,0.72,Read
451.493,4.692,We are transferring database from account A to account B
456.385,1.507,So first of all
458.092,0.995,We will perform read
459.287,0.549,Of A
460.036,1.588,What is A? account
461.824,2.256,So we read account A
464.28,1.506,From where this read will happen?
465.986,0.931,From hard disk
467.117,1.845,The hard disk that is there on the backend
469.162,2.591,From there the data is read first of all
471.953,1.977,And after reading where will the data come?
474.13,1.418,In faster memory
475.748,1.128,Let's say it will come into the RAM
477.076,1.824,As the data came into the RAM
479.1,2.023,What data came let's say in A
481.323,1.623,There are 1000 rupees
483.146,1.17,And in B
484.516,1.979,There are 2000 rupees
486.695,1.79,So as we have done read of A
488.685,2.354,So what value came in A? 1000
491.239,2.639,Now operation
494.078,1.12,What operation is to be performed?
495.398,3.46,Let's say from A I want to transfer 500/- in B
499.058,2.842,So I am performing an arithmetic operation over here
502.1,4.951,A =A-500 simple
507.251,4.105,Means From A account deduct 500/-
511.556,1.962,This is Arithmetic operation
513.718,2.072,But when this operation will be performed
515.99,1.238,Where is this operation being performed?
517.428,1.033,In RAM
518.661,2.322,So we also have to change that value
521.183,2.014,So to change that
523.397,1.42,We have to write
525.017,3.264,Means we have changed the value in RAM
528.481,0.983,We did write of A
529.664,1.707,What is the value A over here?
531.571,1.686,500
533.457,3.465,Because we have deducted 500 from 1000
537.122,1.996,So now what is the value of A 500
539.318,2.587,But remember not in the database
542.105,2.159,Still we have not done anything in the database
544.464,1.231,Still in database there is the same value
545.895,1.827,Where is this work going on?
547.922,0.5,In RAM
548.568,2.54,We did read of A and  got the value 1000
551.308,2.29,A=A-500
553.798,1.304,It is an ALU arithmetic operation
555.302,2.203,"We performed, we did write of A"
557.705,1.414,Write of A means
559.319,2.574,Now that value has changed to 500
562.093,1.771,Value of A has changed to 500
564.064,0.838,But where?
565.102,1.215,Still in RAM only
566.517,3.255,Now we will read the value of B
573.017,1.355,We read the value of B account
574.572,1.495,So from where this value will be read?
576.267,0.909,From database
577.376,1.936,"From backend, from database we read the value"
579.512,0.5,What did it came?
580.046,1.379,2000
581.625,2.074,Now what we have to perform in this 2000?
583.899,3.745,"Plus, B=B+500"
587.844,2.508,What is the meaning of B=B+500?
590.552,1.755,That what is the value of B
592.507,1.818,2000 that had came
594.525,1.119,2500
595.844,4.515,But to do that I will have to write of B is to be done
600.559,1.403,As we did write of B
602.162,0.786,What happened over here?
603.148,1.887,As we did write of B
605.235,2.718,Value of B is updated to 500
608.153,1.981,"But, still remember"
610.334,1.124,It had not happened in database
611.658,2.178,This work is just going on in RAM
614.036,2.986,Because where does CPU always perform?
617.222,1.055,In RAM
618.477,3.589,We discuss this thing very carefully in Operating System also
622.266,1.835,That when a program
624.301,1.638,Is in a Hard disk
626.139,2.095,Whenever we want to execute that program
628.434,3.104,When we want to execute the instructions written in that program
631.738,2.875,Then first bring that program in RAM
634.813,1.004,Or bring it into cache
636.017,0.865,In cache memory
637.082,1.213,When it will come in cache
638.495,1.718,Program is converted into process
640.413,2.23,Now CPU will work on it
642.843,2.921,CPU never directly works on hard disk
645.964,1.763,Due to speed factor
647.927,1.558,Because CPU works very fast
649.685,1.581,And hard disk very slow
651.466,2.404,So in between we have put RAM memory
654.07,1.838,Which is compatible in speed
656.108,1.974,So over here in RAM what work is going on
658.282,1.647,First value of A is read
660.129,1.381,"Changed it, then read the value of B"
661.71,1.095,And changed it
663.005,2.254,Now what is the value of A 500
665.459,1.278,What is the value of B
666.937,1.329,2500
668.466,2.489,Over here 2500
671.155,2.108,Because write of B means
673.463,1.09,B=B+500
674.753,1.288,What is the value of B? 2000
676.241,3.796,So 2000+500=2500
680.237,2.243,And at last what we are using
682.68,0.956,Commit
685.444,1.074,This is the 3rd operation
686.718,1.438,Other than read and write
688.356,1.415,We use a operation
689.971,1.344,Commit
691.515,1.025,What is the meaning of commit
692.74,1.201,Whatever changes
694.141,3.932,Whatever changes we have performed on RAM
698.273,1.748,All that changes
700.221,1.497,Save permanently
701.918,1.168,In hard disk
703.286,3.104,Now what will be the value in hard disk
706.59,1.255,500 of A
708.045,2.944,And 2500 of B
711.189,3.213,So this is what? a way of writing a transaction
714.602,2.508,Whatever transactions we will write in database
717.31,2.91,In that we are performing major 2 operations only
720.42,0.937,One is read
721.557,0.798,One is write
722.555,2.546,But other than read and write also there are other operations like commit
725.301,1.203,Rollback is there
726.704,1.911,When they will come we will see them also slowly
728.815,2.766,But you should know this 2 operations
731.781,1.235,What does read and write do
733.216,2.265,Read means just to access database
735.681,1.59,To fetch the database
737.471,2.473,And write means to change something in it
740.144,1.177,Any change
741.521,2.612,We want to perform arithmetic change in it
744.333,0.906,So this is how
745.439,2.225,We define a transaction
747.864,2.492,And after that in transaction
750.556,2.249,There are many transaction state
