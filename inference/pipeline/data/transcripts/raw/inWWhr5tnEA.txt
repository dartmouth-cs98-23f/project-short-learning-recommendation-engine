0.24,2.639,meet anne
1.68,4.199,she often shops from
2.879,3.0,www.shoppingcart.com
6.16,4.88,she has her information like email id
8.639,4.641,address and credit card details saved on
11.04,5.12,the website to enable a faster and
13.28,4.64,hassle-free shopping experience the
16.16,2.879,required information is stored in a
17.92,3.359,server
19.039,4.32,one day anne received an email which
21.279,5.041,stated her eligibility for a special
23.359,5.041,discount voucher from shoppingcart.com
26.32,3.6,in order to receive the coupon code she
28.4,3.999,was asked to fill in her shopping
29.92,4.479,cart.com account credentials
32.399,3.921,this didn't seem fishy to her at the
34.399,3.761,time as she thought it was just an
36.32,4.079,account verification step
38.16,3.6,little did she realize the danger she
40.399,3.201,would be facing
41.76,3.76,she was knocked off her feet when a
43.6,3.6,substantial amount of money was wiped
45.52,3.28,off her account
47.2,5.6,how do you think this happened
48.8,5.759,well yes the email she received was fake
52.8,3.759,anne's shoppingcart.com account
54.559,4.64,witnessed unauthorized access from a
56.559,4.961,third party this type of attack is known
59.199,5.04,as a cyber attack and the person who
61.52,5.04,carries it out is called a hacker
64.239,4.401,could anna prevented this attack
66.56,4.48,indeed she could have
68.64,4.4,with the help of cyber security
71.04,3.84,cyber security involves techniques that
73.04,4.719,help in securing various digital
74.88,6.16,components networks data and computer
77.759,5.121,systems from unauthorized digital access
81.04,4.0,there are multiple ways to implement
82.88,4.16,cyber security depending on the kind of
85.04,4.88,network you are connected to and the
87.04,4.88,type of cyber attacks you are prone to
89.92,4.0,so let's take a look at the various
91.92,3.28,cyber attacks that anne could have been
93.92,2.96,exposed to
95.2,4.72,one of the most common types of cyber
96.88,6.32,attacks is a malware attack like trojan
99.92,5.36,adware and spyware to name a few
103.2,4.4,had ann downloaded any suspicious
105.28,4.24,attachments online her system could have
107.6,5.199,gotten corrupted by certain malicious
109.52,5.76,viruses embedded within the attachments
112.799,4.881,next is a phishing attack the type of
115.28,4.72,cyber attack which ann experienced
117.68,4.24,here the hacker usually sends fraudulent
120.0,3.52,emails which appear to be coming from a
121.92,3.68,legitimate source
123.52,4.32,this is done to install malware or to
125.6,5.12,steal sensitive data like credit card
127.84,5.6,information and login credentials
130.72,4.08,another type of attack is the man in the
133.44,3.36,middle attack
134.8,4.48,here the hacker gains access to the
136.8,4.799,information path between ann's device
139.28,5.28,and the website's server the hacker's
141.599,5.201,computer takes over anne's ip address by
144.56,4.48,doing so the communication line between
146.8,3.68,ann and the website is secretly
149.04,3.279,intercepted
150.48,5.039,this commonly happens with unsecured
152.319,5.28,wi-fi networks and also through malware
155.519,3.841,password attack is one of the easiest
157.599,3.601,ways to hack a system
159.36,4.239,here anne's password could have been
161.2,4.48,cracked by using either common passwords
163.599,3.521,or trying all possible alphabetical
165.68,3.68,combinations
167.12,4.24,to prevent future cyber attacks and
169.36,3.44,sought to implement a few cyber security
171.36,3.92,practices
172.8,4.64,first she installed a firewall as the
175.28,4.56,name suggests it is a virtual wall
177.44,4.079,between anne's computer and the internet
179.84,3.759,firewalls filter the incoming and
181.519,4.161,outgoing traffic from your device to
183.599,4.161,safeguard your network and they can
185.68,4.0,either be software applications or
187.76,4.96,hardware reinforcements
189.68,5.44,secondly and implemented honeypots just
192.72,4.96,like how flowers attract bees dummy
195.12,4.64,computer systems called honeypots are
197.68,3.44,used to attract attackers
199.76,3.839,these systems are made to look
201.12,5.839,vulnerable in order to deceive attackers
203.599,5.521,and this in turn defends the real system
206.959,4.64,in addition to these she also decided to
209.12,5.36,use unique alphanumeric passwords
211.599,5.441,antivirus software and started avoiding
214.48,4.64,mails from unknown senders
217.04,4.24,that was ann's story
219.12,4.08,cyber attacks are not just confined to
221.28,3.679,individuals but also to public and
223.2,3.679,private organizations
224.959,4.401,the cyber attacks carried out in such
226.879,4.64,places are more deadly and they result
229.36,4.4,in colossal losses
231.519,4.161,motives of such attacks are many
233.76,3.92,starting from tampering with crucial
235.68,3.68,data to monetary gains
237.68,4.479,let's have a look at a few of the cyber
239.36,4.959,attacks that companies are subjected to
242.159,4.561,various public sector organizations and
244.319,4.961,large corporations face the advanced
246.72,4.64,persistent threat apt
249.28,4.08,in this form of attack hackers gain
251.36,4.239,access to networks for a prolonged
253.36,4.24,period in order to continuously gain
255.599,3.92,confidential information
257.6,3.68,companies also witness the denial of
259.519,3.921,service attack where networks are
261.28,4.0,flooded with traffic which in turn
263.44,4.479,leaves legitimate service requests
265.28,5.44,unattended a variant of this is the
267.919,5.28,distributed denial of service ddos
270.72,3.919,attack when multiple systems are used to
273.199,3.921,launch the attack
274.639,4.961,when a hacker manipulates a standard sql
277.12,5.76,query in a database driven website it is
279.6,5.84,known as a sql injection attack by doing
282.88,4.48,so hackers can view edit and delete
285.44,4.56,tables from databases
287.36,4.399,amidst a plethora of cyber attacks it is
290.0,3.84,indeed a challenge for organizations
291.759,4.961,with several networks and servers to
293.84,5.359,ensure complete security this is not an
296.72,4.64,easy task and to help with this cyber
299.199,4.0,security professionals are hired to work
301.36,3.839,on identifying cyber threats and
303.199,3.84,securing a company's network
305.199,4.241,there are multiple job roles in the
307.039,4.321,field of cyber security if hacking
309.44,3.84,fascinates you then the role of an
311.36,3.2,ethical hacker is something to be
313.28,3.44,explored
314.56,4.32,such professionals try to a network's
316.72,3.039,vulnerabilities just like how a hacker
318.88,2.319,would do
319.759,3.44,but only to identify those
321.199,4.161,vulnerabilities and resolve them for
323.199,3.121,protection against an actual cyber
325.36,2.96,attack
326.32,4.159,but if you are looking to design robust
328.32,4.8,security structures then the role of a
330.479,4.881,security architect is more apt
333.12,5.2,a chief information security officer
335.36,5.04,ciso plays a crucial role in enterprise
338.32,4.48,security and is entrusted with the
340.4,3.84,overall safety of the information in an
342.8,3.92,organization
344.24,4.32,so here's a question for you identify
346.72,4.16,the type of cyber attack where the
348.56,3.919,hacker's system takes over the client's
350.88,4.159,ip address
352.479,3.361,a ddos attack
355.039,3.041,b
355.84,4.48,man in the middle attack
358.08,3.119,c phishing attack
360.32,2.4,d
361.199,3.28,password attack
362.72,3.68,give it a thought and leave your answers

369.44,4.16,with the increase in the production of
371.039,4.801,global digital data it is anticipated
373.6,4.64,that cyber attacks will quadruple in the
375.84,4.32,near future organizations are going to
378.24,4.0,need cyber security professionals who
380.16,4.24,can prevent these attacks
382.24,4.799,a career in the field of cyber security
384.4,4.4,is lucrative and a very smart decision
