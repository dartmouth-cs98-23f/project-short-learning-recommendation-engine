0.32,4.8,hey guys and welcome to another video
2.48,4.64,from fast take skills series in this
5.12,4.16,video i'm gonna talk about a very
7.12,3.28,interesting concept which is parallel
9.28,4.08,computing
10.4,4.0,uh this topic or this way of computing i
13.36,4.8,should say
14.4,6.719,uh has been very very popular in the
18.16,4.56,past years and there's a specific reason
21.119,4.32,why which i'm going to discuss in this
22.72,4.879,video but let's have a look at
25.439,4.0,traditional computing
27.599,3.041,the type of computing which is not
29.439,3.601,parallel
30.64,4.8,so we have the processor here
33.04,4.72,and the instructions come in and the
35.44,5.36,processor does the processing and then
37.76,5.52,you have the processed data here as you
40.8,4.64,can see there's a queue of
43.28,5.119,new instructions coming in and the
45.44,6.24,processor is doing its job and then we
48.399,5.361,get kind of processed data out of it now
51.68,3.68,there's a problem with this approach
53.76,3.52,especially in the past couple of years
55.36,4.96,and the problem is that
57.28,5.04,we can only make this processor
60.32,4.159,faster to a limit
62.32,5.119,there is a frequency limit and the
64.479,4.64,reason uh there are plenty of reasons
67.439,4.321,actually but one of the important ones
69.119,4.641,is heat because
71.76,3.6,these processors are
73.76,2.64,very very
75.36,3.6,kind of
76.4,4.56,condensed so the amount of hit
78.96,4.479,generated by electrons moving through
80.96,4.72,the processor is
83.439,6.0,very very high and that's one of the
85.68,6.24,reasons why we can't really increase the
89.439,3.68,speed of processors at one single
91.92,3.36,processor
93.119,5.121,because it will melt down so because of
95.28,6.08,this reason we had to take a different
98.24,5.36,approach so if we want to increase the
101.36,4.32,speed but we can't really increase the
103.6,5.44,speed in one single processor because of
105.68,5.92,heat then what can we do
109.04,6.24,so one thing we can do is to increase
111.6,4.96,the number of processors this way we
115.28,4.799,have two
116.56,7.12,processors running simultaneously
120.079,5.121,and we divide the tasks between these
123.68,4.16,two processors
125.2,5.36,this is called parallel computing to
127.84,6.32,processor running at the same time doing
130.56,5.92,the calculations and we divide the
134.16,5.12,workload between these two processor of
136.48,5.28,course this introduces a new set of
139.28,7.12,potential problems and one of them is
141.76,6.479,more bugs because you should know when
146.4,2.88,first which instructions you need to
148.239,3.28,divide
149.28,4.48,and what instructions need to be
151.519,5.601,dedicated to each of these processors
153.76,6.72,because let's say that you assign a kind
157.12,5.6,of a process to this processor here and
160.48,5.6,that task gets done
162.72,6.159,fast but this task is dependent on a
166.08,5.76,process which is currently being run by
168.879,4.161,the other process here so you can have a
171.84,4.08,kind of uh
173.04,4.8,latencies you can have a different kind
175.92,5.84,of problems when it comes to writing
177.84,6.64,programs for parallel systems of course
181.76,4.479,majority of computers especially since
184.48,3.36,past couple of years
186.239,3.92,are all the computers are running on
187.84,4.96,multi-process multi-core processors so
190.159,4.961,that's another thing each processor in
192.8,5.6,the modern company computing is called a
195.12,5.28,core so a quad core a dual core and
198.4,5.36,that's basically
200.4,6.0,that explains the number of processors
203.76,5.119,running at the same time so this is a
206.4,5.199,very very short video on what parallel
208.879,4.401,computing is we also have distributed
211.599,3.681,computing which is the subject of
213.28,5.92,another video thanks for watching this
215.28,3.92,video and i'll see you later bye
