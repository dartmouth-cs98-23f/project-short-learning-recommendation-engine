My favorite part about doing computer animation 
would be when you discover something new or you find a new way to create something it 
always gets you excited. 
or you find a new way to create something it 
always gets you excited. 
That's the best part.
My passion comes from the massive amount of 
cartoons and 3D animated movies that I watched  just growing up.
Elements of them were inspiring 
and I keep thinking about how I could make them better.
I picked computer innovation because it has a 
real artistic bend to it.
I'm able to sort of take the assignments and be myself.
I think it's the  combination of creativity and technical knowledge.
The types of jobs we can get with these degrees, 
some people are very technical and they'll become  
web developers other people prefer to work on 
the front end and then become web designers.  
Also, our animation both in 2D and 3D, we're 
just now launching a game design program  
that's entirely web-based.
There are a lot of jobs out there. It's a great growing industry.
The world's becoming a lot more 
digital.
The program is fantastic.
I was always interested in video games and 
animation in general and so I just wanted  
to see, maybe there's a program that can help me 
understand it a bit better and get into that field.
We have two degrees, one is an AS and one is an AAS. 
They are very similar, we usually recommend for people who are thinking of going on for a four-year degree to get the  
AS degree while people who are just want 
the two-year degree they go with the AAS.
We have about five different certificates that 
cover some of the classes in digital graphics.  
You have people coming in from high school and you 
have people coming in that work full time that are  
my age and it's just so great to have 
such a variety in class and get to know everybody in their different backgrounds.
So, before I came to school I was a bartender 
full-time.
I decided I needed something a little bit more stable where I was in control.
So, Saint Paul College was an avenue towards that.
They have lots of great scholarship opportunities 
for me as an adult learner and then flexible course times.
The instructors here at Saint Paul College, it's very easy to not only get along with them but to also understand the material.
So, if some things may be a little bit too confusing they're very open to talking to you to make sure that you understand it better.  
It's extremely flexible based on your knowledge, you don't have to be experienced in the field at all in order to 
do it. 
So, if you have no knowledge coming into this, no matter what your age is, you can do it.
You can come here and do it there's no problem.
For people who are looking for affordability, 
who are looking for a lot of variety in the field of web design and animation,
coming to Saint Paul College, it's probably the most affordable it could ever get for someone.
And it works very well for anybody that wants to give it a shot.
