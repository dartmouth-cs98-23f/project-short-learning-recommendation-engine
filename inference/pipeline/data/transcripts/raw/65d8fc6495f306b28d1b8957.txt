hi everyone
today i came up with uh data structures
session
uh session three in this session we can
discuss about
the graphs graph theory of data
structure which is more important
even for jobs okay so let me go to
next slide yeah so let us see what is
graph
a graph is a combination of
vectors and edges consists of a finite
non-empty set
of vertices the finite set of
edges which connects pair of vertices so
suppose in this graph
one two three four five six so these
circles are
vertices and the lines which are
connecting uh these circles
are called edges so we see here v means
vertices one two three four five are the
vectors and edges are
one one four and 4 2
and 2 5 3 5 and 4 5 so these are all
edges okay so a graph
consists of a finite non empty set of
vertices
and a finite set of edges which connects
pair of vertices
okay now let us understand some
terminologies like what is multi graph
what is directed graph
okay multi graph is a graph which
consists of a set of vertices and edges
and it just may contain multiple edges
that is it just
containing same pair of vertices or self
edges
so multi graph it contains multiple it i
mean it's one here
this can contain multiple edges okay it
is containing same pair of vertices
or selfies directly
so what is directed roughly directed
graph is one
in which uh each edge is an ordered pair
of
vertices so if you look at below a graph
uh see here from two to one the arrow is
towards one
so that means this is a directed track
here it is showing this edge is showing
a direction for the edge okay so from
two to one we can go but from one to two
here there is no uh direction so that
means we we can't go from one to two
okay so in directed graph this
one ah one two two is not equals to two
to one
okay because uh we have direction uh
towards only one direction suppose in
the undirected draft
uh this is equal so p1 and v2 both are
equal so v 1
v 2 or v 2 v 1 both are same
but in directed rap it is different
because we depends on direction
okay let us go through let us see what
is undirected of
a graph whose definition makes a
reference to unordered pairs of vertices
that is
v1 or v2 so here if you look at the
diagram in
directed graph so it was showing some
arrow symbol here but here in undirected
graph there is no arrow symbol
or no direction we can check okay so
that is called undirection
i mean undirected graph so in undirected
graph one two four is
uh same as four to one okay
yeah so what is degree of a vectors so
degree of a vector
is number of edges which are connecting
to uh
a number of edges which are connecting a
vertex
so in case of directed graphs and number
of videos are going to a node
is known as degree of corresponding node
and number which is coming out of a node
is known as out degree of
corresponding node so degree suppose let
us take
let us see a is a vertex and va is
being connected with two adjust that
means degree of a is
two okay for b also b is connecting
by two edges so that means degree of
this
undirected vertex b is two
so similarly for if you look at the
second graph
so p ah p has three edges so this one
this one and this one that means p
degree degree of p is three
okay for all other vertices but in
directed graph
as it shows a direction uh
uh as it shows direction so we have two
two types of terminologies one is in
degree and one is out degree
so any edges coming to a particular
matrix
uh with text is called in degree any uh
any edge which is going from current
current vertex is called out degree of
the current matrix
yeah so complete graphs in undirected
draft with n vertices and the nc2
address is said to be complete
the complete graph is under your draft
with n vertices and
nc to n2c2 edges
is said to be complete
see this is uh this one edge should
should be connected to all other ridges
in the graph suppose
this this one so this is p e has
connection to
q or s all three so similarly q also has
connection to all three
other vertices so that is called
complete graph
