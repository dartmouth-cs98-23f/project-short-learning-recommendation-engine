0.0,2.28,"Hi guys, welcome back to the channel."
2.28,6.18,"Probably the most asked question I get in the 
comments and DMs is what computer setup we have."
8.46,5.52,"We have recently updated our PCs, so I think 
it’s a perfect topic for today's video."
13.98,4.8,"Today, I will present my new setup, 
tell you why I chose each component,  "
18.78,2.22,and give you some tips along the way.
21.0,4.02,"In the end, I will let you know 
how much I paid for everything."
25.02,3.9,"***Also, big thanks to RebusFarm 
for sponsoring this video.***"
28.92,5.28,"I don’t do it myself, as I don’t 
have any knowledge about it,  "
34.2,4.44,"but even if I did I think it’s better 
to outsource it to professionals."
38.64,3.24,"In my case, the whole cost of choosing the parts,  "
41.88,4.2,"ordering them, and putting everything 
together was less than 100$."
48.36,2.52,We built our previous setup in 2018.
50.88,1.8,Time flies fast.
53.46,1.92,"It was definitely time for an upgrade,  "
55.38,3.84,"as working became pretty hard 
recently due to outdated hardware."
59.22,4.44,"In each category, I will show you what 
parts I had before for comparison."
64.38,1.98,Let’s start with the CPU.
66.36,4.38,"We went from a 7th-generation Intel 
processor to a 13th-generation."
70.74,4.2,The cost of this CPU is about $680.
74.94,5.1,"Processor is very important to me because 
I do a lot of CPU rendering in Corona."
80.04,6.96,"V-Ray has an option to use CPU, GPU, or hybrid 
mode which uses both CPU and GPU at the same time."
87.0,2.94,"But in Corona, we can only render using CPU."
89.94,3.42,"Because of that, I bought a 
pretty good CPU at the time,  "
93.96,2.94,"it was actually way more 
expensive than my new one."
96.9,2.64,"I think it cost around $1,700 back then."
99.54,7.98,"This CPU simply got old, and I replaced 
it with **Intel Core i9-13900K** which  "
107.52,3.3,"is a good value for money and 
it’s enough for my current needs."
110.82,2.88,"Now, I don’t need a super powerful CPU,  "
113.7,5.22,"because usually I render overnight and when I 
need to render something quickly I use RebusFarm."
118.92,3.0,Here is the processor specification.
121.92,5.34,"It has 24 cores of which 8 are 
performance cores and 16 are efficient."
127.26,7.26,"It has 32 threads and a clock speed of 3 GHz 
in base mode with up to 5.8 GHz in Turbo mode."
134.52,3.6,"If you want to know how these 
parameters affect working and rendering,"
138.12,3.48,"check out my video where I 
discuss computer specs in detail."
141.6,2.1,Link in the description below the video.
145.08,6.48,"With GPU we went from Nvidia 
GTX 1070 to NVidia RTX 4090."
151.56,3.18,"Luckily I haven’t paid 
anything for this graphic card."
154.74,3.0,"I was given it by the Nvidia team for review,  "
157.74,3.9,"the detailed video about that 
is coming next week, stay tuned."
161.64,2.7,"The cost of this card is about $1,800."
164.34,4.74,"As you can imagine, working with my 
old card started to be really hard,  "
169.08,2.4,so that’s the most important update for me.
171.48,2.82,"When I was building my previous setup in 2018,"
174.3,3.42,I simply decided I want to put the majority of my  
177.72,5.1,"budget into CPU to be able to render 
fast and spent way less money on GPU,"
182.82,2.16,as it wasn’t so important back then.
184.98,4.44,"Now, I think even though you might 
mainly use CPU for example for rendering,  "
189.42,4.08,"you still need a powerful GPU, 
especially if you do or want to  "
193.5,3.54,"start with real-time rendering, 
video editing, or animations."
197.04,5.4,"Most of the software depends on GPU right now, 
as it delivers more cost-efficient performance."
202.44,1.68,Here are some specs.
204.12,2.64,As you can see it has more than 16  
206.76,6.18,"thousand cores, the Boost clock is 
2.52 GHz and it has 24GB of VRAM."
212.94,1.74,This GPU is a beast.
214.68,3.96,"Here is the V-Ray GPU Performance, 
as you can see it’s very fast."
218.64,4.86,"If you don’t have a budget for a good enough 
computer, you running out of time or simply have  "
223.5,5.52,"too many frames to render on a single machine, 
I have a great solution for you - Rebus Farm."
229.02,3.18,"And the best part is that you can 
get started with their free trial."
232.2,2.7,"They are a perfect render 
farm for arch-viz artists  "
234.9,2.04,because they support all the popular software.
236.94,5.7,"But most importantly, they have all the plugins we 
need, so there won’t be any unpleasant surprises."
242.64,2.94,"There are no hidden costs, you 
know how much you will pay for  "
245.58,2.82,every render if you use their cost estimation tool
248.4,3.96,"They are also great people! 
They have 24/7 human support,  "
252.36,5.34,"so if you encounter any issues during the process 
they will quickly solve the problem for you."
257.7,2.64,"As I told you, you can 
start with their free trial."
260.34,4.14,"I will put the link to their website in 
the corner and in the description below,  "
264.48,3.24,"so you can check them out and 
sign up for your free trial."
267.72,4.8,"For me, 64GB of RAM is a must, 
which in some cases wasn’t enough,  "
272.52,4.2,so I decided to upgrade it to 128 GB.
276.72,5.22,The 4 times 32 GB of RAM cost me a total of $320.
283.26,4.68,"I haven’t used my old 64GB of RAM 
because the new one is faster."
287.94,3.3,RAM is used basically to store working data.
291.24,4.44,"If you work as a professional I advise 
you to take at least 32 GB of RAM,  "
295.68,4.02,"but in some cases, it may not be 
enough, so 64 GB will be way better."
299.7,3.66,"I don’t think 16GB is enough 
for today’s standards."
303.36,3.36,"Basically, it depends on what 
type of projects you are doing."
306.72,4.92,"If you’re doing simple visualizations or 
animations, it will be fine but if you are doing  "
311.64,6.36,"the complex ones with highly high polygon counts, 
you use high-resolution textures, or you work on  "
318.0,7.56,"scenes that have thousands of objects included 
you will need to go with 64 or even 128 GB of RAM."
325.56,3.96,"Otherwise, you will struggle with 
optimizing your scenes to make it work."
329.52,4.68,"Next, the motherboard, I’m not gonna read 
this name you can see it in the corner :)"
334.2,2.88,The cost of this model was around $360.
338.04,3.18,Motherboard doesn’t affect the overall performance  
341.22,3.78,"but this is a part that connects all 
the parts of the hardware together."
345.0,3.54,"So if you building a PC, you should check if the  "
348.54,3.18,"components you are planning to buy 
are compatible with the motherboard."
351.72,6.0,"Also, the ports, like USB, USB-C, etc, come 
from the motherboard, so pay attention to that."
357.72,3.66,"My new motherboard also comes with 
Bluetooth and WI-FI connectivity,  "
361.38,1.98,which was quite important for me.
363.36,4.74,"I actually kept the same SSD and haven’t 
updated it, as it’s fine for now."
368.1,3.36,"Also, I struggle with time 
and wanted to keep the system,  "
371.46,4.38,"software, and everything as it was 
until I finish my ongoing projects."
375.84,2.22,But I might upgrade it later on.
378.06,6.0,"It’s only 1TB of space, but I have 2 
servers, so I don’t store any files on my PC."
384.06,3.72,If I don’t have a server I would go for 1TB SSD  
387.78,3.42,"where I would have the system 
& all the software installed."
391.2,3.6,"And another SSD drive for 
all the files & projects."
394.8,3.54,The size of the second SSD depends on your needs.
398.34,5.16,"This way the setup is faster, as software 
is loading from a separate drive than files."
403.5,7.62,"This kind of setup with the main 1TB SSD and the 
secondary 2TB SSD would cost you around $260."
411.66,2.82,"I put zero here, as I used my old SSD."
414.48,0.96,###
415.44,1.62,Cooling is super important.
417.06,2.88,I went with Cooler Master MasterLiquid Lite
419.94,1.74,which cost me around $70.
422.22,3.48,"As we do a lot of heavy work 
the computer can get really hot."
425.7,2.94,"In my previous setup, I’ve been 
struggling with cooling a lot,  "
428.64,2.58,as it wasn’t done correctly from the start.
431.22,4.26,"The computer was often overheating 
and was sometimes really loud."
435.48,3.0,"This time I really wanted 
to have this done correctly."
438.48,5.52,"I have had my new setup for a couple of weeks now, 
and I can say I can recommend this cooling system."
444.0,4.92,"I have tested it with all kinds of 
work now, and I don’t have any issues."
448.92,3.48,"It’s also very quiet in 
comparison to the previous setup."
453.36,3.66,"Last but not least, the case."
457.02,5.64,"I bought a be quiet! Pure Base 
500DX Black case for $120."
462.66,4.02,"I wasn’t very happy with the 
previous case, as it was not solid."
466.68,5.16,"It was stressful when moving from one place to 
another because some parts can easily fall off."
471.84,3.48,"This time, I was looking for a solid case."
475.32,4.2,"Normally I would prefer the case 
without LED lights and glass doors,"
479.52,2.4,but I bought it with this video in mind.
481.92,4.068,"It looks way better on the video and 
thumbnail than a simple black box :)"
485.988,0.012,Cost Summary
486.0,2.1,"As all the components are covered,"
488.1,1.86,let’s summarize all the costs.
489.96,4.32,"As you can see setup like this 
costs 37 hundred dollars of  "
494.28,2.34,which the biggest cost is the graphics card.
496.62,7.2,"In my case, the upgrade cost me only 16 hundred, 
as I got the GPU and kept the SSD untouched."
503.82,3.24,"I am super happy with that.
I think it will help me deliver  "
507.06,2.94,better-quality videos faster for you guys ;)
510.0,3.18,"If you want to learn all about 
arch viz, check out my website."
513.18,5.34,"If you are interested in the hardware topic, here 
are another 2 videos you might want to watch."
518.52,1.2,"Bye, bye."
