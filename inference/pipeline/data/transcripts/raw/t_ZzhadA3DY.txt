5.73,4.829,for myself I remember as a child I used
7.68,4.169,these punch cards to like reading cars
10.559,3.181,and things like that my mom was a
11.849,3.781,computer programmer analyst and this was
13.74,4.56,an example of such a computer that my
15.63,4.86,mom used to process payroll data coding
18.3,3.96,was literally done by hand on sheets
20.49,4.83,like these it was a physical endeavor
22.26,5.16,and a manual process during this phase
25.32,5.549,of computing the goal of HCI was simply
27.42,5.339,just to get the data processed now there
30.869,3.511,were three official invention three
32.759,3.991,critical inventions that led this next
34.38,3.72,phase of computing the transistor 2
36.75,4.59,integrated circuits and the
38.1,6.029,microprocessor these inventions enabled
41.34,4.86,computers these smaller to burn faster
44.129,4.561,and more efficient than computers that
46.2,3.81,were built with vacuum tubes and really
48.69,2.939,began the trend towards the
50.01,2.27,miniaturization that continues to this
51.629,5.461,day
52.28,7.689,just this past Tuesday IBM announced new
57.09,4.559,chip that's like smaller than I the size
59.969,6.811,of a grain of salt over there on the far
61.649,7.141,right and the tiny computer is mounted
66.78,3.99,onto a motherboard we have 64
68.79,7.02,motherboards with two tiny computers in
70.77,6.66,the left picture and the fifth computer
75.81,3.87,has the processing power of a typical
77.43,6.63,personal computer made in the 90s like
79.68,6.119,an x86 processor anyway these inventions
84.06,4.32,drove the birth of the personal computer
85.799,5.581,the first personal computer was
88.38,5.34,introduced to 1925 by IBM and it
91.38,4.05,featured a 16 line by 64 character
93.72,4.98,display that ran a computer language
95.43,5.04,called basic now command line interfaces
98.7,3.75,where the primary means of interacting
100.47,5.52,with computers first on terminals like
102.45,6.449,this a deaf bt 101 personal computers
105.99,4.23,Keynes running UNIX or ms-dos the
108.899,3.18,interface would consist of a
110.22,3.81,command-line shell which would accept
112.079,3.171,commands as text input and then convert
114.03,5.04,the commands into corresponding
115.25,5.68,operating system functions the advances
119.07,2.26,made in computing technology created an
120.93,2.2,offer
121.33,3.72,for people to interact with computers in
123.13,4.62,a different way we moved away from
125.05,4.86,physically manipulating bits to interact
127.75,7.11,with computers in a digital space on
129.91,6.87,screen the invention of the mouse by
134.86,5.52,Doug Engelbart and the graphical user
136.78,5.61,interface or GUI revolutionized HCI and
140.38,5.1,it was really during this phase that the
142.39,4.8,field was born the field of HCI early
145.48,4.65,attempts at graphical user interfaces
147.19,5.07,were skeuomorphic and literally tried to
150.13,4.92,replicate the physical world even in its
152.26,4.53,most inefficient ways the most
155.05,3.9,successful style of interaction design
156.79,5.46,has been what we refer to as wynt which
158.95,5.79,stands for windows icons menus and
162.25,4.02,pointer with interfaces are so
164.74,3.15,ubiquitous that this is what comes to
166.27,3.87,mind when we think of the term graphical
167.89,6.0,user interface although not all gooeys
170.14,6.11,are wind systems the language of HCI and
173.89,5.16,a whimp world is direct manipulation
176.25,5.83,complete with nouns represented by icons
179.05,6.03,and verbs represented by menus or
182.08,4.92,buttons and with a GUI and a mouse
185.08,5.97,people can operate under a paradigm of
187.0,7.05,hey you icon go here into that folder or
191.05,4.86,ask the Macintosh computer which
194.05,4.29,exemplified the ideal GUI launched in
195.91,5.1,1984 with principles that emphasize
198.34,5.79,directness user control and real world
201.01,5.22,metaphor now the goal of HCI this time
204.13,4.29,was to leverage pre-existing paradigms
206.23,2.67,of the physical world without taking it
208.42,5.64,too far
208.9,7.23,and make it user friendly the birth of
214.06,3.72,the iPhone and Android based smartphones
216.13,3.93,put the power of computing in everyone's
217.78,4.41,pocket by using our fingers instead of a
220.06,5.88,mouse direct native manipulation is even
222.19,6.24,more direct than with interface we swipe
225.94,4.71,to scroll we literally drag objects by
228.43,3.9,dragging our fingers it's still direct
230.65,3.6,manipulation but the language has
232.33,4.53,evolved to meet the form and the
234.25,4.35,capabilities of the computing device our
236.86,3.45,early handheld computing devices were
238.6,3.9,introduced before we had ubiquitous
240.31,3.08,broadband so functionality at that time
242.5,3.35,is typically
243.39,4.83,into personal digital assistant features
245.85,4.44,like calendaring note-taking contacts
248.22,3.78,management and the internet is what
250.29,3.51,really enabled smartphones to take off
252.0,4.23,and be not just useful but extremely
253.8,4.74,addictive and with the power of what
256.23,4.229,once used to be a supercomputer now in
258.54,4.17,the palm of your hand we enable people
260.459,6.631,to access computing technology from
262.71,5.67,anywhere now where as in the first phase
267.09,3.24,of computing we were bringing the
268.38,4.83,physical world into a digital space
270.33,5.04,sensors enable us to use natural
273.21,5.04,movement to bring a digital world into a
275.37,4.89,physical space the Xbox Kinect mate
278.25,4.29,playing video games of physical endeavor
280.26,4.68,the Fitbit digitized our physical
282.54,4.23,activity ring allows us to talk to
284.94,4.17,visitors at our door even when we're not
286.77,4.02,at home and Nesta made our thermostats
289.11,4.559,smarter by adapting to our usage
290.79,4.29,patterns in the home I like to highlight
293.669,2.521,a few more companies that are doing
295.08,5.1,interesting work in this area
296.19,6.12,particularly in health tech siren care
300.18,3.78,has created smart socks that use
302.31,4.02,temperature sensors to detect
303.96,5.16,inflammation in real time for diabetics
306.33,5.339,so diabetes patients are prone to foot
309.12,4.17,swelling and that can lead to infection
311.669,4.921,or amputation that the foot isn't
313.29,5.01,checked conductive thread is woven into
316.59,3.329,the fabric of the sock to detect where
318.3,3.84,there's inflammation and all this
319.919,5.901,information is uploaded to an app on
322.14,6.0,your smartphone to alert you to an issue
325.82,5.08,here's another company alivecor
328.14,4.44,they offer a mobile fda-cleared EKG
330.9,4.89,monitor targeted towards patients who
332.58,5.1,have atrial fibrillation afib patients
335.79,4.08,have an irregular and brown off and
337.68,4.5,rapid heart rate that can increase their
339.87,5.25,risk of stroke heart failure or other
342.18,4.38,hurt related complications the lac
345.12,4.799,courte offers two ways for people to
346.56,4.8,monitor their heart cardio mobile which
349.919,4.081,is an attachment to your phone and
351.36,4.14,cardio watch which is a replacement for
354.0,3.81,spam for your Apple watch
355.5,4.83,so notification is sent to the user to
357.81,3.26,record an EKG if the heart rate appears
360.33,2.96,in consist
361.07,4.77,with the users activity level now
363.29,4.23,theoretically it could go further all
365.84,4.68,the data is stored in the cloud and
367.52,4.5,alivecor could mine all of the data to
370.52,4.59,make predictions based on what they see
372.02,5.61,for example if your EKG reading mimics
375.11,4.77,the patterns in other patients hours
377.63,6.0,before they had a heart attack a life
379.88,5.82,poor could send you an alert and advise
383.63,4.79,you to take necessary precautions to
385.7,6.48,avoid you know in a minute heart attack
388.42,5.62,so it's computing devices move beyond as
392.18,3.81,computing moves beyond devices with
394.04,3.93,screens language of HCI similar via
395.99,4.14,balls how do you define without a screen
397.97,3.99,so as we bring the digital world into a
400.13,3.48,physical space how do we deal with the
401.96,4.11,ethical and privacy issues surrounding
403.61,4.53,constant instrumentation and mass
406.07,4.05,collection of personal data I wrote this
408.14,3.96,talk before all the news came out of
410.12,3.96,Cambridge of analytic oh I think it's
412.1,3.72,particularly timely and relevant as
414.08,3.69,sensors become ubiquitous we
415.82,3.99,increasingly track every aspect of our
417.77,3.78,lives we may reach a point where
419.81,4.44,computers know more about us than we
421.55,4.86,know about ourselves so already Google
424.25,4.59,and Facebook algorithms know exactly how
426.41,5.07,you feel and countless other things that
428.84,5.43,you may not even know Facebook only
431.48,5.07,needs 10 likes from you to outperform
434.27,4.44,predictions from work colleagues about
436.55,5.04,your preferences personality and
438.71,5.94,dispositions they need them only about
441.59,4.74,70 likes to outperform your friends 150
444.65,4.74,likes to outperform family members and
446.33,4.65,300 likes to outperform spouses so if
449.39,4.47,you have clicked three hundred likes
450.98,5.07,from your Facebook account Facebook can
453.86,4.95,predict your opinions and desires better
456.05,5.16,than your own life partners now imagine
458.81,5.76,that Google or Facebook read every
461.21,5.61,single email text message post we ever
464.57,4.2,wrote to every photo we ever took and
466.82,4.17,combine that with knowledge of our heart
468.77,4.62,rate blood pressure hormone levels in
470.99,5.52,real time as we move through everyday
473.39,5.7,life they would be better equipped to
476.51,5.46,tell us how to vote what mate to choose
479.09,5.31,how to spend our time far beyond what we
481.97,4.91,are consciously aware in the same way
484.4,4.16,that we rely less on our
486.88,4.74,action and navigation now that we have
488.56,4.8,GPS you they decide stop listening to
491.62,4.2,your feelings and start listening to
493.36,4.11,these external algorithms instead this
495.82,3.21,could lead to a scenario where algorithm
497.47,3.89,these algorithms would be better
499.03,4.23,equipped to vote on your behalf
501.36,4.75,obviating the need for democratic
503.26,5.22,elections right in China the government
506.11,4.56,is testing a new way of social control
508.48,4.77,that brings citizens based on their
510.67,4.38,social and financial behavior the Social
513.25,3.96,Credit system would use facial
515.05,4.26,recognition to evaluate individuals day
517.21,4.62,to day behavior and generate a credit
519.31,4.95,score for each person so minor
521.83,4.5,violations like jaywalking or jumping
524.26,3.63,the trampled ticket line could decrease
526.33,3.45,one's social credit in the system
527.89,6.15,thereby affecting their ability to get a
529.78,6.57,loan or travel abroad now strict privacy
534.04,4.26,laws in the u.s. may protect us from
536.35,4.56,this black mirror-like inspired in
538.3,4.59,future but commerce leaf they may hinder
540.91,3.33,us from making the best predictions for
542.89,3.69,customers when it comes to making
544.24,4.71,decisions around our health care based
546.58,4.5,on a genetic database or Big Data since
548.95,4.44,this is all based on statistics the size
551.08,4.86,of a company's database is key to making
553.39,4.38,accurate prediction and Chinese
555.94,3.96,disregard for privacy may actually give
557.77,7.95,them an advantage in the area of health
559.9,7.92,and medicine over the u.s. so in 2011
565.72,4.65,Apple rolled out Siri Google now
567.82,4.11,launched in 2012 marking the beginning
570.37,3.12,of a new phase where an absolutist
571.93,2.58,natural language to answer people's
573.49,3.0,questions
574.51,3.66,we now have fast enough computers and
576.49,3.96,dated where we can actually train large
578.17,4.26,neural networks and as we train them
580.45,6.72,with more and more data that performance
582.43,6.72,improves accordingly in 2015 a 31 year
587.17,4.92,old man a Roman Maz Renko died while
589.15,4.92,crossing streets in Moscow his death was
592.09,4.8,a devastating loss for his best friend
594.07,4.41,Jenny CUDA at the time couldn't have
596.89,2.199,been building a messenger bot that could
598.48,2.339,do things
599.089,4.98,like make restaurant reservations and
600.819,6.401,she fed her text messages with mahzarin
604.069,6.031,go into her neural network and created a
607.22,5.609,bot in his likeness and as a memorial to
610.1,4.919,mother encode could have replicated his
612.829,6.99,personality and could talk to him again
615.019,7.351,via chat bot and so the replica was born
619.819,4.5,the chat bot uses a deep learning model
622.37,4.79,which learns how to mimic how humans
624.319,5.401,speak in order to simulate conversations
627.16,4.899,the version of replica that exists today
629.72,4.799,is used by people who seek emotional
632.059,5.34,support it's not a substitute for Siri
634.519,4.5,or Alexa or Google assistant people are
637.399,5.971,using replicas to talk about their
639.019,5.94,feelings AI researchers and roboticists
643.37,3.36,are testing the limits of how much
644.959,4.38,machines can learn to mimic and respond
646.73,4.68,to human emotion these are the big
649.339,4.44,questions the world of HCI needs to
651.41,5.31,answer now how do you get a machine to
653.779,5.49,think and act like a human what does it
656.72,4.529,mean to be humans or organisms just
659.269,3.99,algorithms and is life really just about
661.249,4.95,data processing processing is
663.259,6.541,consciousness valuable and what about
666.199,5.101,love or human connection what kinds of
669.8,4.43,relationships do we want to have with
671.3,5.25,machines are they our friend assistant
674.23,4.599,19e law enforcer
676.55,3.959,pleasure partner what is the role of the
678.829,5.07,machine and what is the role of the
680.509,4.92,humans and machines are increasingly
683.899,4.17,trained to think and act like humans
685.429,4.08,their ability surpass ours and many of
688.069,2.911,the startups that I work with are using
689.509,3.721,human users to train the machine
690.98,4.469,learning algorithms so that machines can
693.23,5.06,do the same work at a much faster much
695.449,5.19,larger scale and as this too comes
698.29,4.839,realized this technology becomes
700.639,4.74,realized the goal of HCI is no longer a
703.129,4.44,view a goal unto itself but a goal to be
705.379,4.351,moved in fact one of the executives that
707.569,4.921,I worked with boldly proposed a
709.73,4.5,quarterly no UI goal where the goal
712.49,5.269,would be to launch at least one feature
714.23,5.669,per quarter that requires no human user
717.759,3.971,but what happens when there's so much
719.899,3.69,automation that humans have no
721.73,3.659,role in decision-making when our lives
723.589,3.571,are at stake and we've all heard about
725.389,4.32,the way mail access sorry that uber
727.16,4.679,accident that happened to imagine you're
729.709,3.93,writing in a self-driving car and
731.839,4.951,because there's still some cars on the
733.639,5.161,road that are not autonomous there's a
736.79,3.0,scenario where your car could collide
738.8,3.06,with another because it's not
739.79,4.229,coordinating with the car now should
741.86,5.76,your vehicle be programmed to save the
744.019,5.161,passengers life which is you or you know
747.62,3.18,what what if the car is about to hit a
749.18,4.08,busload of kids and there many more
750.8,5.36,lives at stake okay or what if that
753.26,5.4,busload of people is filled the children
756.16,4.27,what if the other victim is wealthier
758.66,5.25,than you or younger than you or
760.43,5.55,healthier than you and which lies should
763.91,5.34,our machines optimize for and how do you
765.98,5.49,value a life machine values reflect
769.25,4.29,human values and a human centered
771.47,4.229,approach to AI means that our machines
773.54,4.979,should be partners in securing our
775.699,4.681,well-being and how we do that and what
778.519,6.481,we optimize more is our responsibility
780.38,7.17,as designers of technology now augmented
785.0,4.529,and virtual reality systems today are
787.55,3.779,still mostly concert' ties much in the
789.529,3.781,same way that the personal computer was
791.329,3.81,p32 toy in the 70s before useful
793.31,3.66,software was made right now
795.139,4.44,AR is mostly used for specialized
796.97,4.65,applications like flying a drone or for
799.579,4.291,business use such as on factory floors
801.62,4.35,or in the operating room there's an
803.87,4.11,increasing consensus that artificial
805.97,5.01,reality will be or augmented reality
807.98,5.58,will be the new platform in computing in
810.98,4.2,these contexts of use the goal of HDI is
813.56,4.079,to connect the physical world with the
815.18,4.529,virtual world for example how my data
817.639,3.81,on-demand overlaid with the physical
819.709,4.411,world help people do their jobs more
821.449,4.861,effectively or efficiently how might be
824.12,5.31,systems be designed so that they can be
826.31,5.579,used in a hands-free environment now the
829.43,3.899,software for AR and VR systems continue
831.889,3.0,to evolve and thus the language for
833.329,3.901,interacting with them continues to
834.889,3.401,evolve and vary but they all leverage
837.23,3.789,natural human
838.29,4.71,movement mediating mediated by some kind
841.019,6.12,of display whether it's your retina or
843.0,5.25,screen or sensors now whereas AR aims to
847.139,3.361,connect the physical world with the
848.25,4.709,virtual world VR aims to bring humans
850.5,4.259,into the virtual world virtual reality
852.959,4.261,stands to occupy people time and
854.759,6.241,attention either as entertainment or as
857.22,5.64,an escape from reality or both and the
861.0,4.259,world where robots have taken over most
862.86,4.32,jobs virtual world may be the place
865.259,6.26,where people seek a sense of meaning and
867.18,6.81,purpose for their lives now no other
871.519,4.63,invention has the potential to radically
873.99,5.039,change human-computer interaction than
876.149,4.711,brain computer interfaces and today all
879.029,3.98,the interaction with a machine or
880.86,4.26,computer is done through a device
883.009,4.541,between you and the technology whether
885.12,5.19,that's a mouse a keyboard a joystick a
887.55,5.19,screen or a sensor by removing that
890.31,5.61,device and directly decoding the photos
892.74,5.25,from our brains to the devices we break
895.92,4.25,through to a whole new kind of
897.99,4.77,interaction between humans and machines
900.17,4.99,there's one company called control labs
902.76,4.439,that is doing just that the first thing
905.16,4.77,that they want to fix is the experience
907.199,5.07,of texting on phones imagine not needing
909.93,4.2,a keyboard to enter text into a mobile
912.269,5.701,device what if we could send a message
914.13,6.329,to our loved ones from our pockets with
917.97,5.22,our hands still in our pockets okay
920.459,4.951,there's literally no interaction with a
923.19,4.56,machine today neither with the phone or
925.41,4.89,the computer or any kind of robot that
927.75,7.17,this technology doesn't ultimately turn
930.3,7.17,upside down we often engage in research
934.92,5.729,around human augmentation with the noble
937.47,6.33,goal of curing disease or helping the
940.649,5.641,disabled but inevitably groundbreaking
943.8,6.149,inventions are often used to upgrade
946.29,5.97,normal healthy humans as well imagine
949.949,4.111,the future humans may enjoy upgraded
952.26,3.929,physical and mental abilities that will
954.06,3.63,enable us to hold our own against the
956.189,4.261,most sophisticated non
957.69,5.37,just out algorithms with the help of
960.45,4.77,genetic engineering nanotechnology and
963.06,4.53,brain computer interfaces we may reach
965.22,5.22,the variant of superhumans made
967.59,4.35,available only to a select few namely
970.44,4.2,those who are wealthy enough to who can
971.94,5.46,afford it and this it results in the
974.64,4.68,creation of a new superhuman caste what
977.4,3.69,then becomes of our society and we have
979.32,4.68,a caste of people who are engineered to
981.09,4.83,be superior to normal human how will
984.0,6.33,that change the way we perceive and
985.92,6.66,value human life now in the early days
990.33,4.41,of human-computer interaction students
992.58,3.78,like myself studied human cognition and
994.74,5.1,perception which allowed us to make
996.36,5.52,technology useful and usable we could
999.84,4.02,not have imagined that a service for
1001.88,4.14,sharing videos would be used to
1003.86,4.38,radicalize people or that the very
1006.02,4.05,social media platforms used to move the
1008.24,4.56,middle-east towards democracy would be
1010.07,6.24,used to disrupt the u.s. democratic
1012.8,6.33,process in the 2016 election the future
1016.31,6.66,languages of HDI need to be informed by
1019.13,7.59,ethics politics art and an understanding
1022.97,5.76,of human consciousness who decides how
1026.72,4.88,technology evolves and how it should be
1028.73,4.859,directed we're all collectively
1031.6,4.41,designers of our relationship to
1033.589,4.681,technology educators policymakers
1036.01,4.87,philosophers and that those journalists
1038.27,4.799,executives employees we all play a role
1040.88,3.809,in shaping the discourse and public
1043.069,4.411,opinion around our relationship to
1044.689,4.051,technology and especially creatives
1047.48,3.87,whether you're designers
1048.74,4.35,filmmakers actors or artists they have
1051.35,3.81,the skills to help imagine the future
1053.09,4.38,realities and help them make them
1055.16,3.6,tangible to us so that we understand the
1057.47,5.25,potential consequences of our decisions
1058.76,6.81,before they materialize and as consumers
1062.72,5.28,in a capitalist society we help decide
1065.57,6.59,what's worth using what's worth our time
1068.0,4.16,and attention we all own that
