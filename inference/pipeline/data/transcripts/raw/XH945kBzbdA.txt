0.399,4.241,Are you doing software testing for past
2.8,3.36,many years and now want to transition
4.64,4.08,into data science?
6.16,5.2,You are not alone! I get this question so
8.72,4.24,many of the times and in this video I am
11.36,3.84,going to provide you
12.96,5.2,some useful and effective tips that can
15.2,5.839,help you make a transition from testing
18.16,2.879,to data science.
22.72,4.0,First of all this transition is
24.4,4.0,certainly possible. There are many who
26.72,2.719,have made this transition and I'm going
28.4,3.999,to share
29.439,4.161,one story of Bindiya Rajendran
32.399,2.961,who
33.6,4.16,described the story on Analytics Vidhya
35.36,3.68,platform and the link is in video
37.76,2.24,description below. So you can read
39.04,3.359,through it.
40.0,5.44,But she made this transition after
42.399,4.801,eight years of working as a software
45.44,4.24,test engineer.
47.2,5.199,So let's uh go through
49.68,4.399,some of the tips that can help you. So
52.399,2.64,the tip number one
54.079,3.681,is
55.039,4.721,first you need to figure out in which
57.76,4.0,role you want to make the transition
59.76,3.599,because when you talk about data science
61.76,4.24,as a field
63.359,4.241,"there are various roles- data analyst,"
66.0,3.28,"data engineer,"
67.6,4.559,data scientist.
69.28,5.68,Data analyst among all these is the most
72.159,5.361,easiest one relatively.
74.96,5.04,Relatively data analyst is
77.52,4.32,easier than data engineer or
80.0,4.72,data scientist.
81.84,4.319,So maybe you can start with data analyst
84.72,2.96,if you are very good in math and
86.159,3.92,statistics you can
87.68,4.799,start with data science
90.079,3.921,data scientist as your target
92.479,3.6,or if you are very good in software
94.0,5.6,engineering you can
96.079,6.0,make a data engineer your ultimate
99.6,5.199,career objective.
102.079,4.881,But all of these roles have some common
104.799,3.921,things into it and I have a video which
106.96,2.64,describes the difference between these
108.72,2.719,three
109.6,3.76,"roles, so you can watch it you will get a"
111.439,3.68,full understanding.
113.36,3.119,So the tip number one- I would like to
115.119,3.121,share is
116.479,3.201,in your current job
118.24,3.519,you are working as a software test
119.68,4.32,engineer you don't want to leave your
121.759,5.601,job all of a sudden
124.0,5.44,so to prepare for data science migration
127.36,4.879,you have to start using
129.44,4.64,python to automate your day-to-day
132.239,3.041,boring tasks.
134.08,3.28,As a
135.28,5.2,test engineer you might be doing manual
137.36,5.36,testing or automated testing using tools
140.48,4.88,such as selenium.
142.72,4.08,In day to day life you have so many
145.36,2.959,manual tasks you know you might be
146.8,5.2,getting some extra file doing some
148.319,6.961,analysis or you might be performing same
152.0,7.12,repetitive tasks. These are very easy to
155.28,6.56,automate in python. Python is a very very
159.12,4.96,easy language to learn even a high
161.84,4.72,school student can learn it easily.
164.08,4.799,I have a python programming tutorial
166.56,4.0,playlist. If you watch just first 10 or
168.879,4.481,15 videos
170.56,4.48,you should be fine. You can easily
173.36,4.48,start working on it.
175.04,4.4,So learning python to automate the task
177.84,3.28,is tip number one.
179.44,3.76,As a test engineer you are working on
181.12,5.119,some three tier software application
183.2,4.56,which will have some type of database.
186.239,4.161,In that database
187.76,5.52,you can now perform some basic data
190.4,5.919,analysis you can use python and pandas
193.28,6.879,for doing that analysis or you can use
196.319,5.84,any BI tools such as power BI or tableau
200.159,2.8,So let's say I have an insurance data
202.159,1.841,set
202.959,2.721,or a
204.0,3.84,sales data set
205.68,4.96,you can perform basic analytics
207.84,4.72,"such as what was my sales,"
210.64,4.4,how was my sales growth in last three
212.56,6.319,"months, how does the sales look like"
215.04,5.919,based on different geographic regions.
218.879,4.64,If you don't know power BI
220.959,5.441,I have done a very good project on power
223.519,3.921,BI like a real life power BI project
226.4,3.52,and that
227.44,4.079,playlist is quite popular. I have
229.92,4.0,received comments from some of my
231.519,4.561,subscribers saying that after doing that
233.92,3.84,project they actually got a job as a
236.08,5.359,data analyst.
237.76,6.0,So follow that project and try to apply
241.439,4.401,on data analytics you know try to build
243.76,4.399,dashboard. Like dashboarding is a very
245.84,4.8,basic thing that you can do.
248.159,4.64,All you need is some kind of database
250.64,4.64,Wherever there is data- there is data
252.799,5.521,science. So you can there is always a
255.28,4.72,scope of building dashboards.
258.32,2.8,If you are working on a
260.0,3.36,database
261.12,4.72,as a test engineer. Now I know it's not
263.36,5.04,your part of your regular job so you
265.84,4.0,"have to spend extra effort on weekend,"
268.4,2.48,during the night
269.84,3.68,to build
270.88,5.28,these analytics dashboards and then
273.52,3.92,present it to relevant people in your
276.16,2.72,company.
277.44,2.8,These people could be your business
278.88,2.56,manager
280.24,3.6,or
281.44,4.08,your company will have a data
283.84,3.68,science department.
285.52,4.16,Try to build relationship with the
287.52,4.8,people in data science department. There
289.68,4.16,"will be data analysts, data scientists."
292.32,3.2,You talk to them
293.84,3.28,you say okay I have built this dashboard
295.52,2.48,do you think it's useful
297.12,2.48,or
298.0,4.24,you can say
299.6,5.2,"I want to learn data science, do you have"
302.24,4.64,any tasks where I can help? I will. I want
304.8,3.679,to help you so that I can learn and
306.88,3.44,usually people are nice some people
308.479,3.681,might say no but you will find one or
310.32,4.719,two people who who would be willing to
312.16,4.56,help. So the key here is persistence if
315.039,2.961,you get no
316.72,5.199,don't
318.0,4.8,get demotivated. Keep on trying
321.919,2.481,and
322.8,4.56,on job learning
324.4,4.72,is often the best because
327.36,3.119,you are building something
329.12,2.799,tangible
330.479,3.44,that can be
331.919,3.201,useful in the company
333.919,2.961,and
335.12,4.4,the
336.88,4.4,best advantage you can get out of it is
339.52,2.88,you know inter company department
341.28,4.16,transfer.
342.4,5.2,I have seen enough examples where within
345.44,4.88,a company the person is working in a
347.6,3.84,different role as a test engineer
350.32,3.92,and
351.44,5.039,they can transition to a data science
354.24,4.16,department within the same company that
356.479,6.401,transition is easier because you know
358.4,7.2,interviews won't be that tough.
362.88,4.4,It won't be as tough as as if you are
365.6,3.84,applying in a
367.28,3.84,outside company. So
369.44,4.08,migrating to data science department
371.12,5.519,within the same company is the best
373.52,5.6,thing that can happen.
376.639,4.961,Many times as a test engineer you are
379.12,4.56,working on logs.
381.6,5.28,So you can do some log analytics using
383.68,5.519,"python, pandas or some of the BI tools"
386.88,4.24,and you know build nice dashboards and
389.199,3.761,present the findings to engineering team
391.12,4.48,"or your business manager, or your test"
392.96,3.76,engineering manager.
395.6,3.439,Now
396.72,5.28,when you decide to transition sometimes
399.039,6.561,people have this dilemma that hey I have
402.0,6.24,worked as a test engineer for five years
405.6,5.36,now if I'm migrated
408.24,4.32,am I going to start from ground zero
410.96,3.84,and the answer is no.
412.56,4.56,There are two important skills that you
414.8,5.28,have built as a test engineer that will
417.12,5.28,be extremely useful in your data science
420.08,4.88,journey. Skill number one is your critical
422.4,4.72,thinking ability as a test engineer you
424.96,5.28,are finding bugs in your software you're
427.12,5.04,thinking about diverse workflows in your
430.24,3.92,software and trying to find bugs you
432.16,2.879,know by doing critical thinking.
434.16,2.96,So
435.039,4.241,if you realize or not
437.12,5.04,over this period of time you have built
439.28,5.52,solid critical thinking abilities that
442.16,5.039,are very very important when you start
444.8,4.399,working in data science industry. Another
447.199,3.921,skills you have developed is domain
449.199,4.081,knowledge. Let's say I worked as a test
451.12,3.919,engineer in healthcare industry
453.28,2.96,or retail industry
455.039,3.44,I have gained
456.24,3.84,"lot of domain knowledge, you know, I know"
458.479,3.84,a lot of processes
460.08,4.799,and the domain knowledge is extremely
462.319,5.041,important when you go to data science
464.879,5.04,industry. It's not all about learning
467.36,5.76,machine learning or python pandas. Those
469.919,5.201,are two skills but the core skills
473.12,5.12,which is communication domain knowledge
475.12,4.4,business understanding core skills are
478.24,3.84,extremely
479.52,4.72,important and you have those core skills
482.08,4.799,so when you transition you're not
484.24,5.12,starting from ground zero you're already
486.879,3.361,halfway the other half way you need to
489.36,3.279,cover
490.24,3.6,by learning
492.639,3.441,specific
493.84,3.12,tools. Now I'm going to
496.08,2.0,share
496.96,3.679,certain
498.08,3.92,common tips which are
500.639,2.721,applicable.
502.0,3.039,Doesn't matter
503.36,4.239,if you are
505.039,4.88,transitioning from test engineer or
507.599,4.401,mechanical engineer etc.
509.919,3.761,While you're doing your nine to six job
512.0,3.039,thinking about transitioning to data
513.68,3.359,science
515.039,3.44,the first thing you should do is
517.039,4.721,start learning
518.479,5.761,data science skills in parallel
521.76,4.48,and this you can do by watching Youtube
524.24,6.0,videos such as my channel has a lot of
526.24,5.84,Youtube a lot of videos on data science
530.24,4.64,a tool skill set
532.08,4.16,you can also enroll into courses you
534.88,3.519,know there are so many e-learning
536.24,3.12,platforms. You can buy a course for like
538.399,2.961,10
539.36,4.32,and you can learn those skills there are
541.36,4.0,many boot camps. Boot camps are basically
543.68,4.0,two to three month
545.36,4.88,fast-paced learning programs
547.68,4.4,that you can join and learn those skills.
550.24,3.599,So learn those skills
552.08,3.84,in your extra time
553.839,4.161,on your weekend.
555.92,3.2,If you want to go to Youtube
558.0,3.44,search for
559.12,5.04,code basics data analyst
561.44,5.36,three months roadmap. I have a complete
564.16,4.64,roadmap where you can learn data analyst
566.8,4.159,skills in three months and if you want
568.8,4.88,to learn data science skills you can
570.959,4.961,search for code basics data scientist
573.68,4.56,six month roadmap. So I have a six month
575.92,5.359,roadmap for data scientist and these
578.24,5.2,roadmaps covers all the free resources
581.279,4.721,You don't have to spend any money you
583.44,3.68,can just learn things on your own all
586.0,4.0,you need is
587.12,4.24,good internet connection a willpower and
590.0,4.16,a laptop.
591.36,4.159,So learning skills on your own while
594.16,4.48,you're doing job
595.519,5.841,is a very important tip. The next step is
598.64,4.08,after you have learned these skills
601.36,3.28,you want to build
602.72,3.6,a project portfolio.
604.64,3.68,The project portfolio which you can put
606.32,3.759,on your resume which you can highlight
608.32,3.519,on your github page.
610.079,4.401,So how do I do
611.839,5.761,data science related projects?
614.48,4.72,Well my channel has a lot of projects so
617.6,2.4,in if you go to my channel and search
619.2,3.92,for
620.0,5.36,codebasics and data analyst projects I
623.12,5.6,have couple of projects and the popular
625.36,6.56,project is sales insight power BI
628.72,6.4,project. So in power BI me and my friend
631.92,5.84,we build a analytics dashboard
635.12,5.12,using the sales data
637.76,6.079,and by following this project so many of
640.24,5.76,my subscribers have got a job I'm not
643.839,5.921,kidding. I'm getting so many messages on
646.0,5.2,Linkedin saying that this project helped
649.76,2.16,them get a job.
651.2,2.56,So
651.92,3.599,my youtube channel is one way if you are
653.76,3.6,"looking for machine learning projects, I"
655.519,3.921,have another playlist for machine
657.36,5.52,learning projects where I did a project
659.44,5.76,on Bangalore property price prediction
662.88,5.44,image classification.
665.2,4.879,Even I built a mobile app for potato
668.32,3.28,disease classification using deep
670.079,4.32,learning and these are end-to-end
671.6,6.0,"projects they cover model building,"
674.399,5.281,"making application, writing server in"
677.6,3.679,fast API. These are like end to end
679.68,2.8,project how you would execute these
681.279,4.161,projects in
682.48,4.56,corporate if you got a job full-time job
685.44,3.839,as a data scientist.
687.04,3.84,So by following these projects you're
689.279,2.8,learning important skills and what you
690.88,4.0,need to do is
692.079,4.88,customize these projects so that you can
694.88,4.32,make it a unique project for yourself.
696.959,5.44,It's not like you're copying my project
699.2,5.04,for example for image classification- I
702.399,4.401,did
704.24,5.36,spot celebrity image classification now
706.8,5.12,you can do the image classification for
709.6,3.76,movie personalities or some spiritual
711.92,3.919,personalities or even your family
713.36,5.2,members. You can customize it there is so
715.839,4.881,much creativity. So you use my projects
718.56,3.76,as a reference but then customize it for
720.72,3.28,a different data set
722.32,3.759,and make it your own
724.0,3.44,unique project.
726.079,3.921,You can also
727.44,3.44,go to nearby NGO for example and ask
730.0,4.0,them
730.88,5.92,that you can help them for free.
734.0,4.56,Nowadays non-profits will have
736.8,4.24,a three-tier application they will have
738.56,3.92,databases and wherever there is data
741.04,3.28,there is data science. There is a scope
742.48,3.44,of data science you might have to try
744.32,3.36,multiple times
745.92,4.24,and you might get a success. If you're
747.68,4.48,offering your help for free to NGO or
750.16,3.359,even to your relative who might have a
752.16,3.359,small business who might have some
753.519,5.361,"database, ask them to build some"
755.519,6.721,dashboard for free like BI dashboard is
758.88,5.68,an is a no brainer. You can do it anytime
762.24,4.8,you have a database you can
764.56,4.64,build cool BI dashboards in power BI and
767.04,3.76,tableau very easily.
769.2,3.759,By working on
770.8,4.08,real projects you are learning a lot of
772.959,4.961,real life skills it's not like dummy
774.88,5.519,titanic data set project. You know
777.92,5.2,then comes kegel participation on
780.399,6.161,kegel.com you can go and
783.12,6.48,participate into competitions.
786.56,5.92,I did a video with Tanul Singh
789.6,5.039,who is a mechanical engineer.
792.48,3.84,And after his study in a mechanical
794.639,3.841,engineer every day he would spend few
796.32,4.24,hours on kegel and he built a good
798.48,4.24,reputation on kegel and after his
800.56,4.399,finishing his degree in mechanical he
802.72,5.04,immediately got a job as a data
804.959,5.44,scientist. So your kegel rank performance
807.76,4.319,are going to be super helpful.
810.399,4.481,Now if you
812.079,5.44,feel alone in your journey you can make
814.88,4.56,partners Codebasics
817.519,3.281,has a discord server
819.44,4.32,where
820.8,4.0,you can go to partner and group finder
823.76,3.759,channel
824.8,4.719,and find buddies. You know you can find
827.519,4.0,friends online friends and you can do
829.519,4.401,group studies. Group study has many
831.519,4.801,"benefits you keep yourself motivated,"
833.92,4.96,"accountable, you learn from each other"
836.32,4.319,and you generally networking is always
838.88,4.399,useful. So
840.639,5.44,use discord server- the link is in video
843.279,5.281,description below.
846.079,4.32,Let's say now I have learned the skills
848.56,4.56,"I have a good project portfolio, I have"
850.399,4.8,built a resume. For resume also I have
853.12,4.079,different videos so you have a
855.199,4.0,build a solid
857.199,3.921,one page resume. A resume should not be
859.199,4.08,more than one page. Doesn't matter even
861.12,4.159,if you have 30 year experience
863.279,3.601,one page resume
865.279,3.601,now you have one page resume what do you
866.88,5.519,do well
868.88,5.28,you start applying for internship.
872.399,4.321,There's a portal called intersharla. I'm
874.16,5.76,not marketing for them but there are
876.72,5.359,similar portals you can even use uh your
879.92,4.4,Linkedin network
882.079,4.56,You don't build a name a network on
884.32,4.16,Linkedin with data guys
886.639,4.241,data guys and girls.
888.48,4.08,Now these data folks are basically data
890.88,3.199,"analyst, data scientists working for"
892.56,2.719,different companies
894.079,3.44,and
895.279,3.92,you can send them a connection request
897.519,3.921,saying that I want to learn data science
899.199,4.401,I want to connect with you.
901.44,4.959,You can have one of phone call
903.6,4.72,conversation offer your help to them and
906.399,3.201,so on and by building these great
908.32,3.44,connections.
909.6,3.599,What you're getting out of it is
911.76,4.0,whenever their company have any
913.199,3.281,requirement they will be happy to refer
915.76,2.72,you
916.48,5.359,or when you're following the Linkedin
918.48,5.919,post you might get to know about
921.839,5.201,next data science job opportunity. So
924.399,5.12,this way Linkedin networking is very very
927.04,4.08,very important. Okay. So you build your
929.519,3.68,Linkedin network. You went through
931.12,4.32,portals like intersharla and you managed
933.199,5.601,to get internship
935.44,5.28,now the confusion arises- I am doing my
938.8,4.479,usual
940.72,5.2,50 000 rupees a month job
943.279,4.8,you know whatever the amount my maybe
945.92,4.96,and now I want to
948.079,6.081,take this internship which is paying me
950.88,5.36,you know only 20 of my current salary
954.16,3.76,should I go for it? Well
956.24,3.76,it depends on your
957.92,3.839,on your intention. Like how serious you
960.0,3.519,are about data science transition if
961.759,3.281,you're serious about it
963.519,2.801,take few months
965.04,3.039,salary cut
966.32,3.6,do the internship once you have
968.079,3.841,internship in your resume
969.92,4.64,finding job will become more and more
971.92,4.479,easier. So you do one or two internship I
974.56,4.0,know for maybe one year you will be
976.399,3.921,earning less but it's worth
978.56,3.36,because once you get a job in data
980.32,4.24,"science industry, these jobs are very"
981.92,4.719,high paid and you can make up for your
984.56,3.92,loss you know during the internship time
986.639,2.961,period.
988.48,3.44,The last
989.6,4.96,tip I want to give is
991.92,5.279,many times folks will
994.56,4.959,go for data science master either in
997.199,4.0,your own country or abroad.
999.519,3.921,If you go for data science master you
1001.199,4.241,are now spending dedicatedly
1003.44,3.839,two years in your master's you are
1005.44,4.0,learning all the skills the degrees on
1007.279,4.48,your resume and after your master of
1009.44,4.56,course finding job is going to become
1011.759,4.0,easier because then if someone looks at
1014.0,3.36,your resumes okay data science degree
1015.759,3.041,they'll be like okay the person has at
1017.36,2.96,least spent
1018.8,3.44,two years of
1020.32,5.519,dedicated time
1022.24,5.76,in studying data science. So
1025.839,3.6,that is my last tip. But I know
1028.0,3.36,"you'll have to spend money, you'll have"
1029.439,3.281,to take a break from your job
1031.36,2.959,so
1032.72,4.079,be
1034.319,3.281,thoughtful if you're going that route
1036.799,3.12,but
1037.6,5.04,the other tips that I discussed below
1039.919,3.601,are actually enough to make a transition.
1042.64,2.88,Now
1043.52,3.279,one thing you have to remember is when
1045.52,2.72,you're making a transition of course
1046.799,2.88,it's gonna take time.
1048.24,3.28,You will keep on applying in different
1049.679,3.201,companies you will not get a response
1051.52,2.8,Don't get
1052.88,3.28,demotivated.
1054.32,3.68,Use that time you know maybe start doing
1056.16,3.92,open source contribution.
1058.0,4.24,Start helping people on discord. Start
1060.08,3.839,participating on kegel.
1062.24,3.52,So while you're getting
1063.919,2.961,"rejection from all your jobs, you're"
1065.76,3.039,still
1066.88,4.4,making your data science skills more and
1068.799,4.401,more stronger and eventually you're
1071.28,4.16,going to get an opportunity. I wish you
1073.2,7.4,All the best of luck. If you have any
1075.44,5.16,question post in a comment box below.
