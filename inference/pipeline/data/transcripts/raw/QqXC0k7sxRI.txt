second,duration,transcript
7.59,6.759,so the top you agile behind the ilium
11.469,16.741,postback data analytics application to
14.349,18.331,talk about me alright I had started
28.21,6.39,anodized canonical and sort of sort of
32.68,5.55,as data into the areas classes
34.6,9.36,visualization engineer written books and
38.23,8.219,now I'm doing a training as well the
43.96,4.98,books this is sort of based on agile
46.449,7.101,data time 2.0 a thousand three really on
48.94,4.61,a relative are six thousand may exist
53.999,3.88,turn this into a video if you want to
56.499,3.171,learn with you what we talked about
57.879,6.241,tonight
59.67,6.73,that's one x where I'm a component may
64.12,7.41,be product and active because I've set
66.4,7.079,up an attorney so very briefly of cover
71.53,6.299,the theory of this sort of actually
73.479,6.75,science big most pimples on application
77.829,4.381,developers so data products are being
80.229,4.17,assigned I actually leave that building
82.21,4.71,at the fundamental skill for data
84.399,3.93,scientists and that everyone whether the
86.92,3.21,data scientist right should be a
88.329,3.481,tutorial on viewing that name and
90.13,3.54,everything you can then should be an
91.81,4.62,application to them you know that same
93.67,7.86,thing some of my over here is actually
96.43,8.82,questions and so I did a survey on
101.53,6.21,Twitter yesterday and so about half
105.25,9.49,bottles at least the missing amount
107.74,9.55,so some support for this idea and so why
114.74,4.23,do the science and big data I think if
117.29,5.22,you're a data scientist and you build a
118.97,5.85,model or a little app and you have to
122.51,4.62,the absolutely build is to deploy it to
124.82,4.59,get it into the business process to
127.13,4.14,really make change at the company work
129.41,4.05,yeah but you done something really wrong
131.27,4.56,that you should be using big data tools
133.46,4.86,as I'll show you they're not really less
135.83,5.49,efficient and you can use the money on a
138.32,4.86,computer so the goal of the methodology
141.32,4.02,is the document and God Explorer for
143.18,5.04,data analysis to discover at all of the
145.34,4.71,critical path to a compelling product so
148.22,4.08,what is a critical tab there's this
150.05,5.25,incredible task theory you might have
152.3,4.68,seen my aunt char her chart critical
155.3,5.34,path was like the next iteration of that
156.98,7.55,we're yet to sort of figure out how to
160.64,6.09,get we're not necessarily linear and so
164.53,4.48,that's very important when you're going
166.73,4.14,into X product there's a manifesto for
169.01,4.92,agile they at times but it won't so go
170.87,7.53,Chris it's about iteration a lot there's
173.93,7.529,a eat around experiments that sort of
178.4,6.0,structures top or the first thing to do
181.459,4.741,is to plug records through front end to
184.4,4.8,end from the way you're collecting them
186.2,5.25,onto the web and app and then you can
189.2,4.77,start with just enough people in chart
191.45,6.12,so you can start sort of clean a tiger
193.97,4.2,game visualizing project asking
197.57,3.0,questions
198.17,7.17,up next you sort of turn those into
200.57,6.54,report so you extract enemies which will
205.34,4.41,show you and for the roads between them
207.11,6.96,at search instead of got interactivity
209.75,5.91,in reports you can drill down spiral by
214.07,4.169,the way either order to end up that
215.66,4.41,order in which people pay for this so
218.239,4.021,people will take a bit about anymore
220.07,5.7,because that that's that and ultimately
222.26,8.0,what they want to do so up next
225.77,6.68,prediction during the command understand
230.26,5.92,love it when you predict the future
232.45,5.08,things that care a lot about and but
236.18,3.27,ultimately what people care about
237.53,9.42,anyway you actions
239.45,12.569,that's why AII machinery so the tools
246.95,8.24,that we used I used to be a fake fanatic
252.019,7.5,people that like ask you to take music
255.19,6.789,but archaeologic you ever played used in
259.519,5.4,general if you can be working on spark
261.979,4.671,you probably should most people watching
264.919,4.5,is you don't have to wait five minutes
266.65,7.18,or are simple you know the first line of
269.419,6.091,the next thing that you and pipe are to
273.83,4.11,me and your place page which is in the
275.51,5.52,first edition of the book because the
277.94,5.07,great API Python Python has really
281.03,7.44,powerful tools for manipulating data
283.01,7.77,versus your depth of growth but that's
288.47,4.41,not good enough for many be speaking of
290.78,3.99,the process is the way people are
292.88,4.02,collecting data it's also the way that
294.77,4.649,they're acting on data in real time and
296.9,7.17,really sometimes it can take a few
299.419,7.441,seconds to get work recently so what is
304.07,6.84,no more focus I miss Cassandra sort of
306.86,6.779,wish I had but I also used to LinkedIn
310.91,6.66,that where you could push a dataset from
313.639,7.771,beneath to Voldemort their in-house key
317.57,6.36,value store at in one operation that at
321.41,4.95,the time there was no way to do that in
323.93,5.43,any other database so I had to write the
326.36,4.74,ability to do that entomology it is so
329.36,3.63,simple actually could pull that off
331.1,3.569,because everything in model if you look
332.99,4.86,at the code it's like oh my god to do
334.669,5.281,that and so but as an optimist or like
337.85,4.98,incredibly capable any database in
339.95,6.3,existence including like the timing
342.83,6.269,sequel DB operation
346.25,6.9,yeah any of those can act as the
349.099,6.391,database for this app so I need to do it
353.15,5.579,research elasticsearch is sort of a
355.49,5.97,super spark occurs often really easy it
358.729,4.771,doesn't get in your way and then the
361.46,5.16,number of web frameworks sort of like
363.5,5.18,Ruby's the natural flash is one of them
366.62,4.46,I love it because
368.68,3.99,there's a plug in if you do anything you
371.08,3.45,don't have to reinvent the wheel but
372.67,3.84,that is not an easel budget small that
374.53,5.49,you have to learn to get something done
376.51,9.21,you just define your web after is simply
380.02,8.13,a network so the way the slowest data
385.72,6.18,processing is your work we collect
388.15,5.88,events with pasta we save them to a CSS
391.9,7.17,or if you're in the cloud something like
394.03,8.16,x3 we process the in match with the sign
399.07,6.27,language spark publish back to mommy be
402.19,5.88,be presentable flash and browser huge
405.34,4.65,key chef is amazing it's not on here but
408.07,7.44,people each dress everything I made is
409.99,7.8,really ugly now she's kind of it's not
415.51,7.92,my I mean my call I could get like a
417.79,7.83,style each draft plug-in is far as start
423.43,4.77,those the beautiful ecosystem because
425.62,4.47,you get spark and there's such people
428.2,4.05,which I'll talk about more you get
430.09,5.85,people now without having to do separate
432.25,5.64,tools like Pig and hi you get spark and
435.94,2.73,outlet which is very competitive with
437.89,4.38,scikit-learn
438.67,5.94,a lot of people use a single metal
442.27,4.71,contact and you get a spark stream you
444.61,5.36,have to share code between you things
446.98,11.04,which is incredibly valuable
449.97,9.91,yes in the book we do both and then that
458.02,5.67,so I got lines of code for each to
459.88,6.6,publish given tasks Egyptian but yeah if
463.69,6.12,you one chapter and boat and and move on
466.48,5.25,to like just feeling spark ability
469.81,8.13,because it became clear that the things
471.73,7.98,you have a explosion I find it's very
477.94,8.79,competitive and it works with many
479.71,8.76,machines for yet so I was a very dating
486.73,4.31,up people die because it has got to
488.47,6.41,eight people trying to do
491.04,6.09,in it it really bit and so you know
494.88,3.66,whether few people and those people in
497.13,4.11,the whole preservation was a very big
498.54,5.31,thing people when you get complex like
501.24,5.19,this it's really ugly and I can't follow
503.85,8.01,it I can only do like one sub select
506.43,7.5,before my brain box and but there's this
511.86,3.72,data file programming which is good if
513.93,6.75,you're doing something complex this is
515.58,8.18,like page and you can count the email
520.68,7.5,addresses between email addresses and so
523.76,6.64,good that it sort of broken out but with
528.18,5.46,spark to get you sequel and vehicle
530.4,6.06,program so beautiful for women so we
533.64,6.21,want to do select filter which is very
536.46,6.75,convenient and our using people and here
539.85,5.46,we do of how it's not everybody because
543.21,5.34,we're looking at all the data but it has
545.31,6.18,been bouncing that and vehicle program
548.55,4.77,uses plot a histogram on that Anita like
551.49,4.65,it's incredibly powerful to be able to
553.32,5.79,both I was in love with peak but when I
556.14,5.76,first used spark almost pride because
559.11,6.33,I've been waiting five minutes or my
561.9,8.79,life for five years and it was just joy
565.44,7.26,on the big plan hold that and the data
570.69,6.03,that we work with in this application is
572.7,8.19,online performance data in the data flow
576.72,5.82,select event so it was a great website
580.89,4.98,almost data where it's a rigorous
582.54,6.65,description of everything but 99% of
585.87,7.86,flights report Wester on time miss
589.19,7.24,choose FAA and why they really so once I
593.73,4.2,really analogy that gives it like why
596.43,3.87,are our planes late usually
597.93,4.29,and it's usually the carrier's fault but
600.3,4.2,there's a whole lot of categories in
602.22,4.8,there like I'm getting stick this is not
604.5,5.28,their competence mister probably most of
607.02,4.41,the time it's not very common accident
609.78,4.08,most likely reading apply plays because
611.43,3.699,of previous licenses so this is the
613.86,4.24,first three
615.129,5.82,but this date is really cool there's
618.1,5.21,tons of field analysis to do it but
620.949,6.51,these are cons of the bunch of sorties
623.31,6.94,and then there's the open file or
627.459,4.8,database they give you information on
630.25,5.1,Air Force Air Lines and route to be
632.259,6.411,employed and then we scrape the FAA
635.35,6.06,registry this data is on the website
638.67,4.899,so I actually get you put this script in
641.41,5.429,the code the code by the way for all
643.569,6.901,business freeze you can place it on the
646.839,6.48,agenda that's great if I did include
650.47,4.679,that in the script for the project that
653.319,4.681,didn't want the site to go down so I
655.149,5.43,just let you download the result but so
658.0,5.1,he's created a excel number data we use
660.579,5.341,Python upto module to pull in
663.1,4.32,descriptions of your lines that sort of
665.92,3.779,thing and I thought this was going to go
667.42,8.099,down and Chompy and presently till
669.699,8.07,there's nothing today because of climate
675.519,4.5,chief weather data is available in a
677.769,7.951,very convenient point through the last
680.019,7.891,decade or two decades somebody I love an
685.72,5.58,image I would export of the lower left
687.91,5.669,on this guy reclining if he's like
691.3,4.139,interviewed climbing his business at the
693.579,3.171,top of the mountain think that's awesome
695.439,5.4,don't question it
696.75,6.009,no reclining the stack so working our
700.839,5.071,way up the data by appearances for the
702.759,7.83,app start by plumbing systems inning to
705.91,5.52,end so what we do is to sort of to
710.589,2.821,collect the data
711.43,5.629,now we're processing and publishing data
713.41,6.09,to extra buted store which is mommies
717.059,5.22,publishing like isaac kamalii needy and
719.5,5.279,spark looks like this this is a helpful
722.279,6.461,modulating forward we look the part a
724.779,5.461,file to the grapes columnar format you
728.74,4.41,don't have to
730.24,4.56,you think but a blur which rigorously
733.15,4.68,defined fields you can just sort of
734.8,4.92,store things convert JSON to this comic
737.83,3.72,format which automatically compresses it
739.72,4.17,in the same way that you would have
741.55,5.45,probably like a star schema especially
743.89,6.72,monopoly because it's a great corner and
747.0,5.83,then you must be because a data frame is
750.61,4.95,the new singing but the old sitting is
752.83,7.5,an RDD you have to convert to that many
755.56,7.65,stores and publishing records to elastic
760.33,5.85,searches again two months behind two
763.21,4.56,lines of code 100 resolved I did have to
766.18,5.25,figure it as option alpha says it
767.77,5.61,overloaded rating the the copy idea is
771.43,4.5,one line but if you have like a hundreds
773.38,5.49,of spark cluster and Tunis MongoDB
775.93,5.79,cluster need to think before you use
778.87,4.5,these two months of code but in this
781.72,7.71,case they're all live also compare the
783.37,8.49,data set that option and so putting
789.43,4.65,those records on the web is some flat
791.86,5.1,import to the import time on where the
794.08,5.22,client define a route on a
796.96,3.03,function for that route will appear on
799.3,4.86,the web
799.99,9.03,well rameters from weary strings get the
804.16,8.82,data after this JSON turn runcam the
809.02,7.77,plastic grid it looks like that but if
812.98,8.37,you get a date on plugin for chrome away
816.79,9.36,which i recommended for years so then
821.35,7.67,we're on to tables and charts this is
826.15,7.59,how do you make a data table in high pot
829.02,6.88,so we register the parkade bottle but
833.74,7.92,you know the party files register it for
835.9,7.17,people very direct are people you just
841.66,4.32,call smart people
843.07,6.36,when people that give us a data frame
845.98,7.14,back you know you lurk back to the old
849.43,5.46,format and stage tomorrow you have to be
853.12,6.78,there for charging the college gift
854.89,9.02,model and then make it plotting the data
859.9,7.13,size SS data communication on the chart
863.91,5.41,this is the controller and for flash
867.03,4.6,model is great it could actually be
869.32,4.74,quite complex and something like int and
871.63,6.48,restoring the data so that's why you
874.06,6.75,want to stand simple and we render the
878.11,5.73,template this is the template most HTML
880.81,7.59,we move through the flight and plot the
883.84,7.68,row of columns element room and then get
888.4,8.36,you this one others is very complex but
891.52,8.49,it forms the basis for the high level
896.76,5.53,this is the code for the chart this is
900.01,5.16,the same thing but we return JSON that
902.29,4.92,it when this template this looks complex
905.17,4.11,but copied this from an example from my
907.21,3.99,boss talked and edited three lines and
909.28,4.62,that's how everyone does everything in
911.2,5.88,d3 these people don't really talk about
913.9,5.01,it but 95% of the trucks out there in
917.08,5.1,the street start as an example of my
918.91,5.43,boss back in there very super fun so
922.18,11.61,that gives you this is highlighted one
924.34,12.39,mode July popular so beyond that and
933.79,5.49,start to build rapport with the explore
936.73,5.79,data to the interaction this hasn't
939.28,5.19,enough yet for my data button start with
942.52,5.1,a homepage search is a great way to get
944.47,7.16,started but no I think you should do
947.62,6.72,data science evidence you act so so
951.63,4.87,they're tagged every play they don't
954.34,7.11,want search and then you have pages per
956.5,7.75,individual like airplane flight 71
961.45,4.94,routes airline one will show
964.25,4.05,and they link between each other
966.39,7.53,providing drill down and interactive
968.3,8.229,there so this is the home page page
973.92,4.83,about Airlines activates be very
976.529,4.981,surprised of the name but these are the
978.75,5.31,airlock colors for all domestic airlines
981.51,5.04,in u.s. in a lot of that type the first
984.06,9.12,story today is that two month wife
986.55,9.779,doesn't do a lot of trees because this
993.18,5.399,is the airline MC page so as I said we
996.329,4.831,call descriptions on Wikipedia to make
998.579,6.901,extremely easy to do it innings -
1001.16,7.32,airplane pages by calendar and those
1005.48,7.25,internally flights by best airline it's
1008.48,6.419,people providing their activities URL
1012.73,4.479,the other thing that is great for a
1014.899,4.321,portal search engine elasticsearch make
1017.209,4.081,CD we do have to be a bit of how speedy
1019.22,4.2,provide like previous and next I
1021.29,5.22,couldn't find a good plug into flats I
1023.42,4.889,actually have to implement it you could
1026.51,4.86,use what I wrote with a little bit of
1028.309,7.53,trouble and then so we also start care
1031.37,6.9,for atomicity as a whole so this is that
1035.839,5.49,the airplanes paid with terrorizing us
1038.27,5.939,leads the first iteration anything any
1041.329,4.771,is some to take iterations so here's the
1044.209,3.691,second iteration where I got with a lot
1046.1,4.68,of tiny values that didn't really care
1047.9,6.21,about much more interested in who make
1050.78,4.41,up a fleet as a whole you can see here
1054.11,3.27,McDonnell Douglas
1055.19,5.79,it appeared mobile times and I overlap
1057.38,6.75,the other wheel also through iterations
1060.98,6.12,gets rid of the overlap and then the
1064.13,5.42,fourth iteration does any resolution to
1067.1,5.64,remove the duplicate Ozma conferences
1069.55,5.2,now any resolution is really hard in
1072.74,4.95,general and really complicated and could
1074.75,5.09,be a zone top or series of top but in
1077.69,4.099,this case I got away with just
1079.84,5.01,okay with the first 10 characters and
1081.789,7.561,let's group on those and then projects
1084.85,6.54,the most common tag so Patricia
1089.35,4.559,unemployed and then we get a charge that
1091.39,4.98,sort of is count blowing down the fleet
1093.909,4.921,of aircraft is a bit second and the tons
1096.37,5.33,of small things like all our gear prayer
1098.83,10.79,and you don't have to select the empty
1101.7,10.27,series so the next level is ridiculous
1109.62,7.87,but if you teaching for fun and profit
1111.97,7.77,or the curator so that architecture for
1117.49,6.689,the back ends of it is let me s horrible
1119.74,9.0,Dedra on the GFS or in the cloud is
1124.179,7.581,actually on your computer and then you
1128.74,6.75,start the match model to train the model
1131.76,6.549,we predicted this and then these are
1135.49,5.52,streaming earlier so that it respond in
1138.309,8.791,real time to conjure funny model on real
1141.01,7.26,foundation and so it works really well
1147.1,3.329,actually
1148.27,5.07,this is sort of the top are sparks Mike
1150.429,3.99,after you will set a tool in another
1153.34,3.51,system or something like that
1154.419,4.951,reemployment your model or creating your
1156.85,5.76,own wait absurd predictions from a model
1159.37,5.909,is not a lot of fun it could be either
1162.61,7.08,going to keep you quite bar but yeah
1165.279,11.491,this up so make sure to be back and get
1169.69,10.83,that lease of universal bottle is it it
1176.77,5.899,is it's medium size LT delicious taking
1180.52,4.86,water step in it there's a new type of
1182.669,5.411,asset I forget the name of it but it
1185.38,4.289,will you can Princeton pointed at a
1188.08,4.44,place minus 3
1189.669,5.37,and if new records come into the file to
1192.52,5.1,make up that table so process them as a
1195.039,4.471,priority and to square it
1197.62,3.98,yeah that's a nice thing that I have to
1199.51,5.989,use digital edge
1201.6,5.939,I think it's brand-new I personally
1205.499,7.5,haven't you I don't think it is part of
1207.539,7.801,part 2.1 I put into context a lot of it
1212.999,5.03,is the site right now so this would
1215.34,5.1,still probably be the same because the
1218.029,5.02,like it's possible to transfer data
1220.44,6.089,columns in real time all active learning
1223.049,6.84,but it's much harder and there's you
1226.529,6.15,can't easily do it and so I think you
1229.889,5.16,would still train a batch and so this
1232.679,4.44,reviews there but definitely for many
1235.049,8.49,applications or new interesting way to
1237.119,9.12,process and so the client designs
1243.539,6.781,they're your web page with a phone class
1246.239,5.16,and you have three serious which when
1250.32,3.839,you submit the form
1251.399,4.02,yes a lot of you deals and it's a
1254.159,5.13,conservative class
1255.419,5.911,why ask me about jobs actually of adding
1259.289,4.35,all the fields that are in the training
1261.33,4.049,data that aren't in the form like for
1263.639,5.6,instance the day a year the day upon
1265.379,7.11,these are features that I've had and so
1269.239,5.981,it then submits a request for a
1272.489,4.68,prediction let's pop a message in JSON
1275.22,4.919,everything in the JSON because I've
1277.169,3.87,never read it using JSON ever and I
1280.139,3.99,haven't read music
1281.039,5.94,Avro thrift and all of the others who
1284.129,4.831,might have ever used in some sort of
1286.979,4.62,like it's something she doesn't fit into
1288.96,6.63,a JSON message just put in a block and
1291.599,6.21,you're like leave the fungal up and so
1295.59,4.289,start reading reading from the cost of
1297.809,4.8,you respond to make the prediction
1299.879,5.88,distorted and monarchy in the meet
1302.609,6.45,wildest I got a UUID from this end point
1305.759,5.76,that points them out a new URL where he
1309.059,5.82,holds every section or however long walk
1311.519,10.62,and get it on with the prediction window
1314.879,9.9,guys you need time to just hold and so I
1322.139,5.67,think our building is model extreme
1324.779,6.341,vectorization so you tend to start with
1327.809,6.851,data that renders that feel
1331.12,6.24,and there get a number or strength what
1334.66,6.12,you need them into machine learning is
1337.36,7.35,matrix for vector format so in vector
1340.78,8.79,format each row is a record and each
1344.71,8.13,column here is a number but yet it's
1349.57,6.96,like carrier the shading for nominal
1352.84,7.29,type Oracle you have to inform the
1356.53,7.71,caching trick so every be thousand of
1360.13,6.18,that field yet be called so Delta giving
1364.24,4.68,long everything at the column but all
1366.31,7.95,Americans is one two best method for
1368.92,7.83,that row Delta look like and on Europe
1374.26,4.65,Beijing for definition to the Atlantic
1376.75,8.64,one for this record like that but
1378.91,9.11,overworked therefore chirality so this
1385.39,7.07,is 109 lines of code to trim them off
1388.02,7.75,note that scikit-learn 166 line sources
1392.46,5.56,24 lines to get the ability to run this
1395.77,5.94,on as many machines as you want which is
1398.02,6.66,I think a small tax credibility and I
1401.71,4.56,think is at least as keen as I could
1404.68,8.52,learn although it's not quite of
1406.27,9.3,teachers so if a prediction worked if it
1413.2,5.37,has a lot of value than your job becomes
1415.57,5.16,often ended or become someone's job you
1418.57,4.5,could be a whole team full time job like
1420.73,4.59,with people you may know anything to
1423.07,5.55,drive an anti-business and probably a
1425.32,5.79,paper and so this is butter that one
1428.62,5.25,person once it work and then I clear to
1431.11,3.9,a huge team that authorized it this is
1433.87,2.42,the performance of the model of
1435.01,4.65,counterpoint
1436.29,5.68,once I set or you have to then set up an
1439.66,5.28,experiment so that you can make one
1441.97,7.55,change to the model run the experiment
1444.94,8.28,and then check if it helped them out and
1449.52,6.66,so that is overhead us that in
1453.22,2.96,approximately
1456.289,9.1,here we'll add a lot of lanes and then
1461.97,5.429,the rest is we had to teach gypsy models
1465.389,3.74,so there's a lot of ways to improve a
1467.399,4.02,mod you can also search for
1469.129,4.481,hyperparameters things that aren't
1471.419,3.661,optimized by the machine learning you
1473.61,5.49,have a sort of search for them at random
1475.08,6.15,essentially to figure out probably like
1479.1,4.02,a PhD data find us with know what each
1481.23,4.439,one means I have no idea that my
1483.12,7.559,research look pretty much most people do
1485.669,8.821,and but yeah so it gets more complex but
1490.679,6.35,it feels not you know that much to do
1494.49,6.419,like for instance I was able to build
1497.029,6.161,labovick filter in squash MLS in 20
1500.909,4.801,lines of code does that recommend
1503.19,5.689,content based on history of
1505.71,6.03,recommendation remember literally 25
1508.879,8.341,good in some ways more powerful than
1511.74,18.0,that doing Wow I got to do it okay ah
1517.22,21.959,this is e and D question if you kind of
1529.74,13.62,doing on this hot be made as a basis of
1539.179,7.801,this the fundamentals on TV speaking in
1543.36,9.12,an equal sign with a professor but for
1546.98,7.409,running this is all day yes
1552.48,5.01,so the book covers everything from
1554.389,5.831,researching the algorithm to deployment
1557.49,6.0,into production you could literally take
1560.22,9.02,it try to tell to hear it doesn't
1563.49,5.75,perform very well but yeah and all
1579.57,11.14,Walla Valley Chicago oil day often open
1586.24,10.05,oh you mean I even tie sparkles opposed
1590.71,8.25,to now Jupiter I'm trying to integrate
1596.29,6.15,deeper to notebook into this process to
1598.96,5.55,they're circling class process and they
1602.44,4.02,just released in I haven't gotten is
1604.51,4.95,working that yes they definitely have
1606.46,6.36,their place they aren't interactive and
1609.46,6.84,you can't drill down and you can't
1612.82,5.49,search and so there's some above it and
1616.3,4.92,you can't serve predictions but for
1618.31,4.32,report and like I fear something we use
1621.22,4.26,them in the book actually like to create
1622.63,5.61,the initial model now there's charts and
1625.48,5.4,things where so that yet is they're
1628.24,11.46,awesome but I'm trying to integrate them
1630.88,15.96,into this whole stack that haven't each
1639.7,9.78,other yeah they're off yeah and
1646.84,4.26,ultimately if I just like sort of think
1649.48,5.88,about how to build tools that enable
1651.1,6.66,this process yeah that might be one the
1655.36,4.77,ability to kind of take up something
1657.76,10.7,from a cheaper another book and turn it
1660.13,8.33,into something interesting I'm not sure
1673.83,6.399,okay thank you very much
1676.13,4.099,[Applause]
