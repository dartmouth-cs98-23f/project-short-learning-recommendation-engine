0.74,4.72,hello my name is Eliza Minh I hope that
3.659,4.081,you will join us for the Kiwi big data
5.46,4.11,science master classes my background
7.74,3.899,lies in computer graphics which aims at
9.57,4.08,methods to develop very fast and
11.639,4.831,efficient display of large-scale data
13.65,4.86,sets these data sets sets can be varied
16.47,4.17,it originates ranging from point clouds
18.51,5.07,over meshes to even volume
20.64,4.83,representations the representation on
23.58,3.959,the screen in the end can sometimes be
25.47,3.84,informative or realistic depending on
27.539,3.57,the task at hand in this way is
29.31,4.56,important for very different domains
31.109,5.431,such as simulation purposes medical
33.87,5.279,domains architecture Geoscience engine
36.54,4.679,and also interesting is that there are
39.149,3.631,many aspects that come into play there
41.219,3.0,to have a good understanding of human
42.78,3.57,perception or to make the best
44.219,4.561,illustration possible and to also also
46.35,4.95,support tasks such as visual data
48.78,4.02,analysis I hope that I can welcome you
51.3,4.79,to master class very deeply more
52.8,3.29,insights will push your work
