7.359,3.841,hey everyone my name is ishaan and i
9.28,3.84,welcome you all to this session in this
11.2,3.84,session we will be talking about agile
13.12,4.239,project management and several other
15.04,4.159,things related to it before we begin
17.359,4.08,let's have a look at all the topics we
19.199,4.401,will be covering today first we will see
21.439,4.08,the basics of agile project management
23.6,3.839,then we will check the relevance and
25.519,4.08,principles of agile project management
27.439,4.401,we will then see necessary steps to
29.599,3.841,implement agile methodology along with
31.84,3.6,that we shall also see different
33.44,4.4,frameworks involved in the process and
35.44,4.639,finally we shall see some companies that
37.84,4.559,use agile project management so without
40.079,4.32,any further ado let's get started with
42.399,3.921,what is agile project management agile
44.399,3.68,project management as the name suggests
46.32,3.919,is a flexible approach to building a
48.079,4.16,project in agile project management the
50.239,4.561,project is broken down into several
52.239,4.16,stages of sprints agile does not work on
54.8,3.919,the principle of delivering the final
56.399,4.241,product at the end of the project it
58.719,4.081,works on delivering sections of a
60.64,4.0,project or mini projects the process of
62.8,3.84,project management in the case of agile
64.64,4.24,is agile based so there won't be any
66.64,3.6,central control of project manager as it
68.88,3.36,was there in the traditional way of
70.24,3.6,working before we move forward let's
72.24,4.239,have a look at the agile development
73.84,4.959,cycle agile methodologies consist of
76.479,4.881,several small cycles or sprints at the
78.799,4.64,end of each stage we get a mini project
81.36,4.32,there's a product backlog that explains
83.439,4.241,new features changes in the existing
85.68,4.079,features and several other improvements
87.68,4.32,in the project then we have a sprint
89.759,4.641,backlog which has a list of tasks that
92.0,4.32,are to be completed during each sprint
94.4,4.48,the sprint consists of planning
96.32,4.88,designing execution testing and
98.88,4.72,deployment stages and at the end of each
101.2,4.4,sprint a mini project is delivered with
103.6,4.08,every sprint new features are added to
105.6,4.4,the product which plays a significant
107.68,4.24,role in the overall project growth after
110.0,3.92,all the sprints and early validation in
111.92,4.559,the development the final deliverable
113.92,4.239,has a fewer chances of failure let's now
116.479,3.68,have a look at some reasons why
118.159,3.841,industries have started moving towards
120.159,4.081,agile project management the first
122.0,3.92,reason is high product quality when we
124.24,3.44,talk about higher product quality we
125.92,3.679,refer to the build of the product as per
127.68,3.84,stakeholders demands testing is
129.599,4.081,performed at short intervals of time
131.52,4.079,wherever needed to ensure high quality
133.68,4.08,of the product then another reason is
135.599,4.241,customer satisfaction whatever is done
137.76,3.44,in the project is known by the customer
139.84,3.2,the deliveries don't take longer
141.2,3.92,durations as they used to take in the
143.04,3.839,case of traditional ways the changes may
145.12,4.0,be provided by the customer in the
146.879,4.881,execution phase of the project third
149.12,4.8,reason is reduced risk since the project
151.76,4.479,is divided into sprints so if the risk
153.92,4.24,affects one sprint it doesn't mean whole
156.239,4.0,of the project will be at risk the
158.16,4.48,process of risk analysis continues to
160.239,4.241,take place with all the other processes
162.64,4.0,another significant reason for agile
164.48,4.399,project management is better and faster
166.64,4.48,return on investment the project is now
168.879,4.881,developed in several sprints and each
171.12,4.8,print has its own version therefore the
173.76,4.479,project becomes market ready after a few
175.92,4.24,sprints only since the projects can now
178.239,4.08,be released with ease and in shorter
180.16,4.24,duration this helps the organization to
182.319,4.081,stay ahead in competition with respect
184.4,4.559,to other organizations which have still
186.4,4.16,not moved to agile methodology now we
188.959,3.36,shall check the principles of agile
190.56,4.16,project management there are 10
192.319,4.64,principles for successful agile project
194.72,4.0,management the first principle is the
196.959,3.681,satisfaction of the customer by
198.72,3.68,delivering the project fast and with
200.64,3.679,least number of errors the next
202.4,3.759,principle refers to decreasing the
204.319,3.84,amount of time between the phase of
206.159,3.761,planning and delivery the third
208.159,4.401,principle states that the team of
209.92,4.319,managers and developers work together
212.56,3.92,and increase the productivity of their
214.239,4.321,work the next principle states that the
216.48,4.0,changes requested by the stakeholders
218.56,4.0,can be taken into consideration and
220.48,3.92,worked upon during the development phase
222.56,3.92,as well the fifth principle pays
224.4,4.16,attention to the factor of coordination
226.48,4.08,among the team members then the sixth
228.56,3.92,principle refers to the process of
230.56,4.239,monitoring and tracking the progress of
232.48,4.56,the project at the end of each sprint
234.799,4.561,and making amendments wherever needed
237.04,4.399,moving on the next principle states that
239.36,4.239,there must be a feeling of trust and
241.439,4.401,support towards the team to complete the
243.599,4.481,project's objectives the next principle
245.84,3.759,emphasizes on face-to-face conversations
248.08,3.76,with the development team the
249.599,4.081,face-to-face conversation helps in both
251.84,2.72,solving problems and easy knowledge
253.68,3.04,sharing
254.56,4.32,then the 9 principle emphasizes on
256.72,4.479,finding solutions and maximizing the
258.88,4.64,amount of work done with simplicity this
261.199,4.56,ensures timely completion of tasks by
263.52,5.36,all the team members the last principle
265.759,5.841,states that scrum tools like monday.com
268.88,4.8,or zoho sprints must be used to simplify
271.6,4.64,the complicated codes which further
273.68,4.88,helps in saving time we shall now see
276.24,4.32,the steps in agile project management
278.56,4.079,the goal of agile methodology is to
280.56,4.079,produce shorter development life cycles
282.639,4.241,and more frequent product releases than
284.639,4.721,traditional waterfall project management
286.88,4.72,so we will now check six steps in agile
289.36,4.399,project methodology the first step in
291.6,4.4,the process is project planning project
293.759,4.0,planning includes feasibility study
296.0,4.4,development of scope breaking the
297.759,4.481,project into executable tasks or sprints
300.4,3.68,and then estimating the amount of time
302.24,3.92,needed to complete those sprints the
304.08,4.72,second step is the step of roadmap
306.16,4.479,creation a roadmap is a plan of action
308.8,4.16,that shows how a project shall evolve
310.639,3.84,over time a list of all the features
312.96,3.28,that the final product should have is
314.479,4.081,created and the steps to achieve those
316.24,4.56,features are taken the next important
318.56,4.0,step is release planning since we are
320.8,4.0,doing the project keeping in mind the
322.56,4.479,agile project methodology the project
324.8,4.08,will complete in sprints that means
327.039,4.081,there will be the release of features at
328.88,3.759,the end of each cycle and unlike the
331.12,3.76,traditional waterfall model the
332.639,4.321,development cycles will be smaller the
334.88,4.64,fourth step in agile project management
336.96,4.4,is sprint planning the sprints are made
339.52,4.08,keeping in mind what all is to be
341.36,4.32,accomplished in that particular step at
343.6,4.24,the beginning of each sprint the goal of
345.68,4.32,that sprint is decided and steps to
347.84,4.32,achieve that goal are taken the next
350.0,4.4,step in the process emphasizes on daily
352.16,4.64,meetings there are short meetings every
354.4,5.04,day to discuss if the team was able to
356.8,4.8,finish the task for each sprint and
359.44,4.4,check if there are any amendments that
361.6,3.84,are required each team member talks
363.84,3.6,about what they achieved in the last
365.44,4.4,print and what are they going to work on
367.44,5.039,in the next print the last step is the
369.84,4.88,step of sprint review and retrospective
372.479,4.321,there are two meetings after each sprint
374.72,4.0,first meeting is for the sprint review
376.8,3.6,this meeting is with the stakeholders to
378.72,3.199,show them the finished product
380.4,3.68,this helps both sides to build a
381.919,4.481,relationship and discuss if there are
384.08,3.76,any issues in the end product the second
386.4,4.0,meeting is for having a sprint
387.84,4.799,retrospective this meeting involves the
390.4,4.32,stakeholders to discuss what went well
392.639,4.321,and what went wrong during the sprint
394.72,4.24,sprint retrospective takes place after
396.96,4.16,the sprint review and before the next
398.96,3.679,print planning now when we know the
401.12,3.84,steps needed for agile project
402.639,4.321,methodology we must understand some
404.96,3.84,agile project management frameworks
406.96,4.4,there are several frameworks available
408.8,4.8,today here we will be discussing some of
411.36,4.48,the most popular frameworks the first
413.6,4.159,framework we will discuss is the kanban
415.84,4.0,framework kanban framework is a
417.759,4.401,well-known framework for implementing
419.84,4.479,agile software development in the case
422.16,4.4,of kanban framework work items are
424.319,4.32,represented on the kanman board which
426.56,4.639,helps all the team members to see the
428.639,4.4,state of every piece of work at any time
431.199,4.321,kanban board not only helps in
433.039,4.88,visualizing the work but also optimizing
435.52,4.799,the workflow among the team the next
437.919,4.881,framework we will discuss today is the
440.319,4.801,scrum framework scrum framework is a
442.8,4.08,popular framework for managing complex
445.12,4.4,knowledge work like in the field of
446.88,4.96,research and advanced technologies scrum
449.52,4.32,is a simple framework that helps team
451.84,4.32,work together and learn through their
453.84,4.56,experiences gained while working on a
456.16,4.8,problem the third framework we will see
458.4,4.56,today is the hybrid framework the hybrid
460.96,4.959,framework is a combination of agile
462.96,5.12,methodology and non-agile methodology in
465.919,4.081,the case of a hybrid framework planning
468.08,4.16,is done using the traditional way of
470.0,4.639,project management while the execution
472.24,4.48,and delivery is done using the agile
474.639,4.081,methodology since the hybrid is a
476.72,4.08,combination of the two it handles the
478.72,4.4,requirement changes and delivers the
480.8,4.16,product in different stages the fourth
483.12,4.24,and the last framework we will see is
484.96,4.0,the lean framework the lean framework
487.36,4.239,works on the principle of providing
488.96,5.12,maximum customer value and creating zero
491.599,4.641,waste it focuses on optimizing the flow
494.08,4.239,of products all through the value stream
496.24,4.48,this helps in eliminating waste all
498.319,4.961,through the process and create processes
500.72,4.4,that requires less human efforts this
503.28,4.08,also simplifies the process of
505.12,4.56,information management and makes it more
507.36,4.799,accurate finally let's have a look at
509.68,4.88,some companies that have opted for agile
512.159,4.481,project management today around 22
514.56,4.0,percent of the organizations worldwide
516.64,4.319,have all their teams working on the
518.56,4.08,principle of agile project methodology
520.959,3.761,let's have a look at some of the most
522.64,4.639,prominent companies in the world that
524.72,7.52,use agile project management in the list
527.279,6.961,we have ibm cisco atnt microsoft philips
532.24,3.92,and samsung and with this we have come
534.24,4.24,to the end of this session i hope you
