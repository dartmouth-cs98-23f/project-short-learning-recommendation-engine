3.36,5.159,hello everyone this is vishali in
6.42,4.679,previous session we discuss about risk
8.519,4.321,management topic with example I have
11.099,3.301,mentioned complete software engineering
12.84,2.94,subject playlist Link in below
14.4,3.6,description box
15.78,4.259,now in today's session we will discuss
18.0,4.8,the next important topic that is
20.039,4.861,software configuration management as per
22.8,4.739,your exam point of view this is one of
24.9,4.16,the most important topic let's start the
27.539,3.841,session
29.06,5.74,in this session we will discuss about
31.38,6.48,sem their importance process repository
34.8,4.439,their functions and tools at the end we
37.86,3.12,will discuss some important questions
39.239,3.061,that have asked in previous year
40.98,5.22,question paper
42.3,7.62,let's see all these points one by one
46.2,6.06,now the first thing is what exactly SCM
49.92,5.279,SCM stands for software configuration
52.26,5.52,management C while developing a
55.199,5.461,particular software project you must use
57.78,4.86,software development life cycle there
60.66,4.819,are various phases like requirement
62.64,6.12,Gathering and planning analysis design
65.479,4.0,implementation testing maintenance
68.76,2.82,Etc
69.479,4.621,now while developing a particular
71.58,6.48,project there are various changes that
74.1,5.82,occur at each phase of sdlc the changes
78.06,4.02,related to the customer requirements
79.92,4.14,changes in software team or the
82.08,4.679,organization changes in government
84.06,4.14,policies and roles or sometimes changes
86.759,4.441,in Project schedule
88.2,5.279,now to handle and monitor all these
91.2,5.64,changes for that purpose software
93.479,6.661,configuration management process is used
96.84,6.48,as per the definition SCM is processed
100.14,5.46,for systematically manage organize and
103.32,6.119,control all the changes in documents
105.6,5.76,codes and other entities in sdlc to
109.439,5.04,monitor all these changes are necessary
111.36,5.88,because it affect on your programming
114.479,6.061,code your project planning then your
117.24,5.94,testing data and other database
120.54,4.679,to handle all these configuration items
123.18,5.579,there are different SCM tools are
125.219,6.781,available like puppet config Hub then
128.759,5.101,solstack ansible git bitbucket Docker
132.0,4.5,these tools are used by the
133.86,4.44,configuration manager to handling all
136.5,4.14,the configuration data
138.3,6.18,the primary goal of SCM is to increase
140.64,7.08,productivity with minimal mistakes
144.48,6.0,now the next topic is importance of SCM
147.72,5.34,and the main importance is configuration
150.48,5.16,manager ensure that all the changes
153.06,5.64,occur in software project are properly
155.64,4.44,planned tested and integrated into the
158.7,4.44,final product
160.08,4.98,it also helps software team members to
163.14,5.879,collaborate and coordinated their work
165.06,6.959,let's take one example Suppose there are
169.019,5.281,new WhatsApp updates are available so at
172.019,4.321,that time you update your WhatsApp from
174.3,4.14,the Google Play Store
176.34,5.399,so at that time there are new features
178.44,6.24,are available right so this SCM process
181.739,5.701,manage and track different versions of
184.68,5.279,particular software system
187.44,6.74,they also ensure that everyone working
189.959,4.221,from the same version of software system
194.239,5.321,also help in deployment phase of
197.099,4.621,software development life cycle they
199.56,5.28,maintain environment on the client side
201.72,5.7,while developing a particular product
204.84,5.399,basically it improve quality and
207.42,5.22,reliability of Software System it also
210.239,4.441,increase efficiency and reduce the risk
212.64,4.86,of errors in particular software project
214.68,5.839,so this is the importance of SCM in
217.5,3.019,software engineering
220.56,5.64,now the next topic is SCM process as per
224.28,4.5,your exam point of view this is one of
226.2,4.56,the most important topic there are total
228.78,4.679,value steps in SCM process like
230.76,5.039,identification Version Control Change
233.459,5.221,Control configuration audit and
235.799,4.86,Reporting this sem processor handled by
238.68,5.639,the project manager configuration
240.659,7.8,manager developer and the end user
244.319,6.961,now let's discuss SCM process in detail
248.459,5.161,now the first step of sem process is
251.28,5.22,planning and identification here
253.62,5.339,configuration manager identify the scope
256.5,3.479,and objective of particular software
258.959,2.941,project
259.979,4.861,for that purpose they arrange meeting
261.9,5.46,group discussion brainstorming session
264.84,4.079,with your software team and different
267.36,3.839,stakeholders
268.919,5.521,configuration manager identify different
271.199,5.541,test cases requirements different models
274.44,4.86,and schedule time of particular project
276.74,5.62,they also identify software
279.3,6.06,configuration items means which type of
282.36,5.52,Hardware resources software resources
285.36,3.899,and human resources are used in
287.88,4.98,particular project
289.259,6.781,basically they maintain a details of why
292.86,6.119,when and what changes will be occur in
296.04,6.06,particular project and by whom this all
298.979,5.881,changes are performed they identify and
302.1,4.92,analyze all these details they also
304.86,5.16,mention proper naming convention to each
307.02,6.899,and every file see here instead of
310.02,6.02,naming a file login.php you should give
313.919,6.361,a file name login
316.04,6.4,v1.2 PHP here v1.2 stands for version
320.28,4.979,number of file C
322.44,5.4,every time new features are added in
325.259,5.22,particular project so also change the
327.84,4.919,name of that particular file that is
330.479,4.681,version 1 add new features that is
332.759,4.621,version 2. again add new features that
335.16,4.44,is version 3 in this way so mention
337.38,5.94,proper naming convention to each and
339.6,6.24,every files and the folders
343.32,6.0,now the second step is Version Control
345.84,5.1,process or Baseline see SCM process
349.32,4.08,handle different versions of
350.94,3.42,configuration objects and the particular
353.4,3.359,product
354.36,6.02,see here in this diagram suppose
356.759,7.081,developer 1 work on WhatsApp
360.38,6.64,v1.1 file that is first version of file
363.84,6.12,now developer to add some extra features
367.02,6.42,in particular product now they mention a
369.96,6.72,file name WhatsApp v1.2 means second
373.44,6.18,version similarly developer 2 developer
376.68,5.34,3 Edit that particular file also add
379.62,4.88,some extra feature in that file now
382.02,6.42,developer 3 give the file name WhatsApp
384.5,6.46,v1.3 Miss third version of that file now
388.44,5.52,this last updated file stored into this
390.96,5.4,repository and multiple stakeholders use
393.96,5.04,this latest or updated version of file
396.36,6.0,so this process are handled by the
399.0,7.199,configuration manager in SCM process
402.36,6.119,they control the alter modification and
406.199,5.34,storing all this latest version file
408.479,6.66,into the Repository
411.539,6.541,now the next step is Change Control
415.139,6.301,process see there are various changes
418.08,5.399,that occur at each phase of sdlc the
421.44,4.379,changes related to the add or edit
423.479,4.56,various configuration item changes
425.819,3.901,related to the user permission or
428.039,4.801,sometimes changes related to the
429.72,5.46,client's requirements right now when
432.84,5.46,there are changes are available so what
435.18,5.7,is the process see here suppose customer
438.3,5.1,want video call this new feature in
440.88,5.58,particular project right so this changes
443.4,4.739,is there now software team said this
446.46,4.26,particular changes to the software
448.139,5.221,configuration manager now software
450.72,5.16,configuration manager check that overall
453.36,3.779,impact of that particular change in your
455.88,4.08,project
457.139,5.161,after that they approve those changes or
459.96,4.799,denied those changes if particular
462.3,4.86,changes affect on your project or there
464.759,4.56,is a wrong impact on your project so
467.16,4.979,configuration manager denied doe changes
469.319,5.1,okay otherwise they approve it
472.139,4.5,if configuration manager approve those
474.419,4.5,changes so Implement all the necessary
476.639,4.021,changes by the software developer and
478.919,3.961,mention all these changes into the
480.66,5.4,document so this is called as Change
482.88,5.28,Control process so basically all the
486.06,5.28,changes are approved by the software
488.16,6.42,configuration manager
491.34,5.94,now the next step is configuration audit
494.58,5.399,process so basically configuration
497.28,5.819,manager here identify that all the
499.979,6.541,changes are properly developed or not
503.099,6.0,they check that or they audit that all
506.52,5.04,the completeness correctness and
509.099,5.701,consistency of modified or changeable
511.56,6.18,items in software configuration process
514.8,5.159,they also mentioned that what is new in
517.74,5.219,each version and why the changes are
519.959,5.521,necessary they audit and verify all this
522.959,5.281,complete process and maintain a document
525.48,5.4,accordingly
528.24,4.8,now the last step is review and Status
530.88,3.959,reporting process basically
533.04,4.14,configuration manager takes some
534.839,4.801,technical review of each and every
537.18,4.38,module in particular project
539.64,4.44,they take a review on application
541.56,5.1,workflow Miss complete workflow of your
544.08,5.16,process from start to end various
546.66,4.26,process and models configuration items
549.24,4.5,means related to software and Hardware
550.92,4.56,resources are properly used or not and
553.74,4.44,all the changing requests of the client
555.48,5.7,they take a review of this thing and
558.18,6.36,mention all these details in documents
561.18,6.18,now this status report provided to the
564.54,5.4,developer tester end users customers and
567.36,4.56,stakeholders they check that your
569.94,4.14,complete project is developed as per the
571.92,4.32,customer requirements
574.08,4.74,they also mentioned some user manual
576.24,5.4,installation process guide configuration
578.82,5.1,guide and do's and don'ts guide see here
581.64,4.8,suppose when you buy a washing machine
583.92,5.22,so at that time there is a user manual
586.44,4.98,is there this user manual mention
589.14,4.5,everything how to install washing
591.42,4.74,machine then how to use washing machine
593.64,4.74,do's and don'ts related to the washing
596.16,4.56,machine right so this is called as
598.38,4.56,review and status report this is
600.72,6.6,developed by the configuration manager
602.94,7.579,this is the last step of SCM process
607.32,6.54,now the next topic is SCM repository
610.519,6.461,basically SCM repository is a set of all
613.86,5.64,Control process and data structure which
616.98,5.4,allows software team to manage all the
619.5,4.019,changes in effective manner
622.38,3.72,see here
623.519,5.281,in this particular diagram this is a SCM
626.1,5.52,repository there are total six tools are
628.8,5.28,used like versioning dependency tracking
631.62,4.38,change management requirement tracing
634.08,4.14,configuration management and audit
636.0,5.22,Trails these are the six tools are used
638.22,5.34,in SCM Repository they manage Version
641.22,4.38,Control change control and Release
643.56,4.019,Control process
645.6,3.96,now these are the different functions of
647.579,3.961,SCM Repository
649.56,4.2,now let's discuss these functions and
651.54,6.419,tools in detail
653.76,7.139,now why SCM repository is used in
657.959,5.701,particular SCM process basically SCM
660.899,5.221,repository is centralized database all
663.66,4.56,the changes are performed and after that
666.12,5.7,store this changes or updated version
668.22,5.76,file into the SCM repository okay the
671.82,5.459,first function is data sharing means
673.98,5.76,this sem repository ensure that all this
677.279,4.081,information are consistently and
679.74,4.32,accurately shared with all the
681.36,5.76,stakeholders then information sharing
684.06,5.88,multiple user access latest version of
687.12,5.459,file from this repository then tool
689.94,4.8,integration here SCM repository use
692.579,4.32,different tools for Version Control
694.74,5.159,Change Control purpose
696.899,5.161,data integration here one or more
699.899,4.321,resources Miss different software
702.06,4.26,resources Hardware resources then
704.22,4.679,different programming languages database
706.32,4.199,framework so integration of all those
708.899,4.021,things while developing a particular
710.519,4.861,product is necessary so they maintain
712.92,4.68,this thing next one is a methodology and
715.38,5.1,foreign enforcement here they Define
717.6,4.919,entity relationship model means while
720.48,3.9,developing a particular project there
722.519,4.081,are different modules are there right
724.38,4.32,and now there is a inter relationship
726.6,4.02,between each and every model
728.7,4.56,and also there is some authorization
730.62,4.74,process let's take an example of college
733.26,4.44,management system there are suppose
735.36,4.44,three modules student teacher and hod
737.7,3.96,module so this all three modules are
739.8,4.099,interrelated with each other
741.66,5.16,student model used by the user student
743.899,6.221,teacher model used by the teacher hod
746.82,5.34,model used by the hod also right so this
750.12,4.26,is called as entity relationship model
752.16,4.799,means which type of modules are there
754.38,5.16,what is their functionality and used by
756.959,5.401,the which stakeholders this is called as
759.54,5.099,methodology enforcement the next one is
762.36,4.5,the document standardization means
764.639,4.681,everything have mentioned in document in
766.86,5.099,particular standard approach so this is
769.32,6.54,a SCM repository function
771.959,6.12,now the next is SCM repository tools the
775.86,4.14,first tool is versioning see as we
778.079,3.841,discussed earlier there are various
780.0,4.2,versions of particular product and
781.92,5.28,particular project so this versioning
784.2,5.819,tool mention all the version numbers of
787.2,4.5,particular file as per their creation
790.019,3.901,date
791.7,4.92,next one is the dependency tracking and
793.92,4.44,change management see as per the
796.62,3.719,customer requirement there are various
798.36,5.159,changes are occur in particular project
800.339,5.94,so they manage and track all the changes
803.519,4.981,in relationship between all the objects
806.279,5.041,and their models for that purpose they
808.5,4.56,use uml diagram next one is a
811.32,3.72,requirement tracing see there are two
813.06,3.839,types of tracing first is a forward
815.04,4.44,tracing and second one is a backward
816.899,5.041,tracing forward tracing means first
819.48,4.56,design a particular product then develop
821.94,4.32,a particular product and after that
824.04,4.5,deliver to the customer and take a
826.26,4.98,feedback from the customer this is
828.54,5.16,called as forward tracing now backward
831.24,4.62,tracing means after developing a
833.7,3.36,particular product check that which is
835.86,3.719,developed as per the customer
837.06,5.04,requirements or not this is called as
839.579,6.0,backward tracing next one is a
842.1,5.76,configuration management so here this
845.579,5.161,repository tool track a complete series
847.86,5.039,of configuration means they maintain all
850.74,4.8,the version of particular product
852.899,4.861,every version there are new features and
855.54,4.799,new specifications are there
857.76,4.98,then audit Trails so audit Trails
860.339,5.041,establish all the information of when
862.74,5.099,why and why whom all these changes are
865.38,5.699,occur they mention all these details in
867.839,6.3,particular database
871.079,5.341,now as per your exam point of view these
874.139,4.561,questions are important first which are
876.42,4.8,the layers of SCM process explain each
878.7,5.34,in detail here you have to explain SCM
881.22,5.16,process for 8 marks then what is SCM
884.04,4.739,explain Change Control mechanism for 7
886.38,4.68,marks then what is software SCM
888.779,5.281,repository explain their features of
891.06,5.519,tool set for 8 marks and explain SCM
894.06,4.38,repository features for 7 marks so you
896.579,4.741,have to prepare this topic completely
898.44,6.74,for 7 to 8 marks
901.32,3.86,so thank you keep learning
