0.12,3.839,it's hard to keep track of all the
1.839,5.0,things that'll supposedly fix climate
3.959,6.72,change but won't such as hydrogen
6.839,6.081,veganism or Quantum Computing wait what
10.679,4.481,yes marketing quantum computers as a
12.92,4.4,miracle cure for climate change has not
15.16,4.68,fallen out of fashion despite my many
17.32,5.44,jokes about it for example in a recent
19.84,5.08,article in the hill Sam how a research
22.76,4.64,associate at the center for New American
24.92,4.4,Security in Washington DC writes if
27.4,3.959,countries are serious about climate
29.32,4.8,change they should get serious about
31.359,4.481,Quantum Computing right if we put all
34.12,4.2,our money into Quantum Computing
35.84,5.64,there'll be none left for oil problem
38.32,5.52,solved but Quantum Computing hype isn't
41.48,5.599,new and this is supposed to be science
43.84,7.44,news so let me tell you what's new new
47.079,6.64,is that Jan lur the AI chief of meta has
51.28,5.52,a surprisingly sane attitude to Quantum
53.719,5.64,Computing this deserve celebration and
56.8,4.88,also investigation because he's making a
59.359,4.88,very good Point according to a recent
61.68,4.88,report by CNBC he said that the
64.239,5.121,Practical relevance of quantum computers
66.56,5.239,is unclear and that many of the problems
69.36,4.88,you can solve with Quantum Computing you
71.799,4.96,can solve way more efficiently with
74.24,4.919,classical computers and that Quantum
76.759,4.601,Computing has got such a longtime
79.159,5.041,Horizon that it's irrelevant to what
81.36,4.52,they're doing at meta I found this to be
84.2,3.599,very interesting because it draws
85.88,3.72,attention to the competition between
87.799,3.721,artificial intelligence and Quantum
89.6,4.479,Compu shooting that's becoming
91.52,5.52,increasingly noticeable and that might
94.079,4.921,just be the final nail in the coffin
97.04,4.359,that is commercial interest in Quantum
99.0,4.439,Computing I thought it would be worth
101.399,4.72,looking at this a bit closer and
103.439,5.161,explaining what I believe he meant you
106.119,4.801,see Quantum Computing is extremely
108.6,4.519,exciting from the research perspective
110.92,4.76,because it's completely Uncharted
113.119,5.04,Territory we've never used such big
115.68,4.799,Quantum things before but getting
118.159,4.64,commercially relevant results out of
120.479,4.841,quantum computers is another thing
122.799,5.161,entirely not only do you need the
125.32,4.919,computers to be big enough and still
127.96,5.08,stable enough to maintain the fragile
130.239,5.08,Quantum States you then also need to
133.04,4.88,demonstrate that they can do something
135.319,5.321,better than a conventional computer and
137.92,4.599,this requires two things first you'll
140.64,3.48,need an algorithm that can run on the
142.519,3.601,quantum computer that has a
144.12,4.44,computational advantage over a
146.12,5.199,conventional computer for some sort of
148.56,5.0,interesting problem and second you'll
151.319,4.481,have to show that in reality it'll
153.56,4.48,actually come out faster the best
155.8,4.04,understood Quantum algorithms are those
158.04,4.199,for certain problems in quantum
159.84,4.84,chemistry that's basically Material
162.239,5.0,Science some problems in logistics and
164.68,5.04,finance and some sorts of code cracking
167.239,4.72,it's a rather limited class of problems
169.72,4.32,of course the companies who want answers
171.959,3.841,to these problems already have pretty
174.04,4.32,good algorithms on conventional
175.8,5.159,computers and these are now further
178.36,5.56,improving with artificial intelligence
180.959,5.081,which is why the current AI boom is bad
183.92,4.12,news for Quantum Computing but how is
186.04,5.559,this even relevant if quantum computers
188.04,5.24,are supposedly unbeatably fast it's
191.599,4.521,because of what gives them their
193.28,6.0,advantage quantum computers work with
196.12,5.36,Quantum bits cuits for short and derive
199.28,5.4,their advantage from the many ways you
201.48,5.759,can correlate or entangle those cubits
204.68,5.32,but it's not that operating the cubits
207.239,5.161,themselves is fast indeed operating
210.0,4.64,cubits is usually slower than doing
212.4,4.32,operations on a conventional computer
214.64,4.799,keep in mind that modern computers
216.72,4.879,operate in the gigahertz range or above
219.439,4.52,that's more than a billion operations a
221.599,4.481,second how fast you can operate cubits
223.959,4.521,depends on the type of cubits but for
226.08,4.84,superconducting circuits it's maybe 10
228.48,4.8,million per second optimistically and
230.92,4.039,iron traps are much slower still and
233.28,3.48,that doesn't take into account the need
234.959,4.2,for error correction which will make
236.76,4.839,them even slower the reason people are
239.159,5.08,excited about quantum computers is not
241.599,5.121,because they're fast per operation but
244.239,5.0,because they need fewer operations to
246.72,4.599,get the same result so you see if you
249.239,4.481,have a small calculation on a
251.319,4.441,conventional computer one that requires
253.72,3.68,fewer operations it will beat the
255.76,4.28,quantum computer because the
257.4,5.04,conventional computer is faster per
260.04,4.52,operation if you increase the size of
262.44,4.16,the problem then both the conventional
264.56,5.079,computer and the quantum computer will
266.6,5.28,need more operations and so more time
269.639,4.961,but for the quantum algorithm the number
271.88,5.48,of operations increases less with the
274.6,5.68,size of the problem so the idea is that
277.36,5.119,regardless of how slow the cubits are
280.28,4.759,eventually the quantum computer
282.479,5.401,outperform the conventional computer
285.039,5.561,because it needs fewer operations that's
287.88,4.92,the theory in practice the question is
290.6,4.439,where this crossover happens where the
292.8,4.839,quantum computer starts to outperform
295.039,5.361,the conventional one that's a moving
297.639,5.681,Target because each time conventional
300.4,5.4,computers become faster or someone comes
303.32,5.0,up with a better algorithm the point
305.8,5.399,where quantum computers finally win
308.32,5.319,moves further away to a higher number of
311.199,4.481,cubits and this is why artificial
313.639,4.4,intelligence is becoming a problem for
315.68,4.68,Quantum Computing because artificial
318.039,4.841,intelligence lets you get more out of
320.36,4.88,conventional computers and the number of
322.88,4.52,cubits at which quantum computers will
325.24,4.72,bring an advantage might eventually
327.4,4.96,become so large that it becomes
329.96,5.16,impractical or just prohibitively
332.36,5.08,expensive to even use them though it's a
335.12,4.44,shame that meta isn't more into Quantum
337.44,4.599,Computing I'd really like to have a
339.56,5.44,button that's thumbs up and down at the
