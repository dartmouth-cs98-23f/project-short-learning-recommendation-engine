1.199,4.481,hey guys welcome
3.12,4.4,in today's digital world data is more
5.68,3.6,valuable than ever before
7.52,3.28,data is the key to the smooth
9.28,4.319,functioning of everything
10.8,4.16,from a government to a local company the
13.599,3.361,success of a company
14.96,3.12,vastly depends on how well they utilize
16.96,2.88,their data
18.08,4.24,this is where database comes into
19.84,3.599,picture you need a database to store
22.32,3.119,data
23.439,4.08,in this video let's learn what is
25.439,4.961,database and the different types of
27.519,5.04,database available today but
30.4,3.52,before we talk about database it's
32.559,4.401,important to understand
33.92,6.159,data data
36.96,4.56,data can be anything and everything any
40.079,4.8,information or fact
41.52,5.84,can be considered as data your name
44.879,4.801,age date of birth or any other
47.36,4.64,information such as your house address
49.68,3.92,your bank balance the vehicle you drive
52.0,4.879,or even the food that you eat
53.6,6.479,can be considered as data
56.879,4.081,details related to a school or a
60.079,4.001,technology
60.96,5.6,or statistics or even mathematics
64.08,5.039,can be considered as data and can be
66.56,6.0,stored into a database
69.119,6.64,data can be in any form such as an image
72.56,6.16,or a video or a file
75.759,6.241,or even a plain text data in any of this
78.72,6.16,format can be stored into a database
82.0,4.72,for a school data can be detailed
84.88,4.32,related to its teachers
86.72,4.079,or its students or the subjects they
89.2,4.239,teach
90.799,4.0,all of these can be data as you can see
93.439,5.401,data can be anything
94.799,5.441,and everything and data can be in any
98.84,4.12,form
100.24,3.44,now that you know what data is it's time
102.96,2.56,to understand
103.68,3.6,where do we store them and the purpose
105.52,4.72,of storing them
107.28,4.879,what is database database can be
110.24,3.44,considered as a container filled with
112.159,3.121,data or information
113.68,3.92,which is electronically stored in a
115.28,4.879,computer system
117.6,3.68,data in any form can be stored into the
120.159,3.041,database
121.28,3.199,the purpose of storing the data into the
123.2,4.08,database is
124.479,3.601,so it can be easily accessed modified
127.28,4.64,protected
128.08,4.64,and analyzed you may already be using
131.92,2.8,database
132.72,3.519,in your day-to-day activities because
134.72,3.599,most of the websites
136.239,3.601,or mobile applications today such as
138.319,4.401,google instagram
139.84,5.759,whatsapp facebook already used database
142.72,2.879,to store data
146.4,3.919,as an example let's say for your college
148.48,4.32,demo project you plan to develop a
150.319,4.64,simple college timesheet web application
152.8,3.76,basically this application should allow
154.959,3.521,you to login through a url
156.56,4.08,and then have options to enter staff
158.48,6.64,details timesheet details
160.64,6.879,student attendance student marks etc
165.12,4.479,since this is a college demo project you
167.519,3.44,may just use your personal computer to
169.599,2.881,develop this project
170.959,3.761,the first thing your application will
172.48,3.2,need is a database to store and retrieve
174.72,2.72,the data
175.68,3.52,hence you need to first install a
177.44,4.64,database on your laptop which will
179.2,4.959,connect to this timesheet application
182.08,3.12,like any other software installed on
184.159,3.121,your computer
185.2,4.16,database software will also be allocated
187.28,4.64,to a specific location in your computer
189.36,2.56,hard drive
192.56,4.0,through your web application whenever
194.239,3.92,you try to save edit or retrieve
196.56,3.2,information the application will
198.159,2.16,actually connect to the database to
199.76,3.52,store
200.319,4.801,modify or extract the data in other
203.28,2.879,words any information that is shown in
205.12,2.64,your application
206.159,3.841,is actually being retrieved from the
207.76,3.36,database and any information you enter
210.0,2.64,in the application
211.12,3.36,will actually be stored into the
212.64,4.0,database
214.48,3.039,but since the database is installed on
216.64,2.8,your computer
217.519,4.08,the data is actually being stored into
219.44,4.079,your computer memory
221.599,4.0,this is a simple example of how an
223.519,4.321,application uses a small database to
225.599,4.161,store modify and retrieve data
227.84,3.039,when it comes to bigger applications or
229.76,3.039,bigger companies
230.879,3.92,they need huge database to store huge
232.799,3.44,data which may be installed on large
234.799,3.281,servers
236.239,3.36,this is true to any application that
238.08,4.879,uses a database
239.599,5.36,the images videos or posts or any other
242.959,3.761,information that you see on facebook is
244.959,3.521,actually stored in a database
246.72,3.84,and whenever you search for a specific
248.48,3.36,post or friend facebook actually
250.56,4.72,searches for this data
251.84,6.799,in its database so
255.28,5.679,is database same as dbms
258.639,3.361,lot of people referred to database as
260.959,3.601,dbms
262.0,4.88,but that's not entirely correct because
264.56,2.88,database is just a container that stores
266.88,3.599,data
267.44,3.84,whereas dbms or database management
270.479,3.041,system
271.28,3.84,is a software which is used to manage
273.52,4.0,your database
275.12,3.12,you need dpms to interact with the
277.52,3.04,database
278.24,3.28,to store modify retrieve and protect
280.56,3.68,data
281.52,4.399,dbms is also required to create modify
284.24,4.48,and delete database
285.919,5.041,users like you and me can use dbms to
288.72,4.32,enter commands in a specific language to
290.96,5.2,interact with the database
293.04,9.04,examples of dbms can be mysql
296.16,5.92,postgresql mongodb neo4j cassandra etc
302.4,5.12,evolution of database started in 1960s
305.759,4.241,when the first type of database were
307.52,4.88,made which was the flight file database
310.0,4.639,here the data was stored in simple files
312.4,3.92,such as csv file or fixed length file
314.639,3.681,etc
316.32,3.92,later on came the hierarchical database
318.32,3.84,and then the network database
320.24,3.92,both of this database stored data
322.16,3.759,through parent-child relationship
324.16,3.68,but both of these databases were
325.919,2.801,incapable of storing complex data
327.84,3.12,relationships
328.72,3.84,hence were soon replaced by relational
330.96,4.56,database
332.56,3.919,fast forward to 2020 in today's world
335.52,3.6,there are mainly
336.479,3.361,two popular database types relational
339.12,3.359,database
339.84,3.359,and non-relational database as per the
342.479,3.201,usage
343.199,3.041,over 74 percent of the database used
345.68,3.2,today
346.24,4.959,are relational database but due to the
348.88,4.4,immense rising data usage over the past
351.199,2.881,decade mainly due to social media
353.28,3.039,platforms
354.08,3.36,non-relational database have become very
356.319,3.44,popular
357.44,4.8,however the biggest companies today who
359.759,3.361,store data related to millions of users
362.24,2.799,every day
363.12,4.4,generally use combination of both
365.039,4.801,relational and non-relational database
367.52,4.72,hence both these database types are very
369.84,4.56,popular and widely used
372.24,3.44,oracle is the most widely used
374.4,3.68,relational database
375.68,4.32,whereas mongodb is the most widely used
378.08,3.6,non-relational database
380.0,4.08,let's briefly look at each of these
381.68,4.959,database types
384.08,4.32,relational database in a relational
386.639,3.12,database data is stored through
388.4,4.639,collection of tables
389.759,6.321,these tables are related to one another
393.039,5.921,each table consists of columns and rows
396.08,4.16,each column has a name and a data type
398.96,3.2,data type can be said
400.24,3.12,as a data rule which is associated to
402.16,3.52,every column
403.36,4.16,only those data that satisfy this data
405.68,3.68,rule can be inserted in the specific
407.52,4.64,column
409.36,4.0,a row can be treated as a record which
412.16,2.92,is formed by single
413.36,4.08,or multiple columns
415.08,4.839,[Music]
417.44,3.36,as an example if we consider an office
419.919,2.641,database
420.8,4.32,it will have information related to
422.56,4.88,employees managers and departments
425.12,3.199,these details are stored in different
427.44,2.879,tables
428.319,4.481,but these tables will be related to each
430.319,4.88,other through certain columns
432.8,3.28,here employee and manager table is
435.199,2.961,related through
436.08,3.519,the manager id column which is present
438.16,3.599,in both these tables
439.599,3.921,in a relational database foreign key
441.759,3.921,constraint is used to form relation
443.52,4.64,between different tables
445.68,4.32,similarly manager and department tables
448.16,4.8,are related through the department id
450.0,4.639,column as you can see employee and the
452.96,3.04,department table are not directly
454.639,4.081,related to each other
456.0,4.24,but still it is possible to fetch data
458.72,3.44,from the employee table based on
460.24,2.88,specific conditions from the department
462.16,3.28,table
463.12,4.24,this is how relational database works
465.44,4.08,information is scattered across multiple
467.36,4.32,tables which are related to one another
469.52,3.6,hence using table relations it is
471.68,4.639,possible to retrieve data
473.12,3.919,from different tables in a relational
476.319,3.121,database
477.039,4.241,using dbms you can enter commands in
479.44,3.599,specific language to store retrieve and
481.28,5.12,modify data
483.039,6.16,this specific language is sql or
486.4,4.56,structured query language sql is a
489.199,2.801,programming language which follows a
490.96,2.48,standard format for
492.0,3.919,querying data across different
493.44,4.56,relational database
495.919,3.12,most of the financial institutions such
498.0,3.28,as bank
499.039,3.761,or insurance companies use relational
501.28,3.84,database
502.8,4.079,examples of relational database are
505.12,6.24,oracle mysql
506.879,7.04,microsoft sql server postgresql etc
511.36,4.239,non-relational database when it comes to
513.919,3.761,a non-relational database there are
515.599,4.481,several categories of database
517.68,3.039,such as key value store document
520.08,3.519,database
520.719,4.321,graph database wide column database
523.599,4.641,search engine database
525.04,4.32,time series database etc each of these
528.24,3.2,database
529.36,4.4,store data differently and are useful
531.44,5.92,for managing specific types of data
533.76,3.6,let's briefly look at a few of them
537.92,4.16,key value database also called as key
540.8,3.36,value store
542.08,4.319,it is the simplest of the non-relational
544.16,4.239,database and as the name suggests
546.399,3.601,every data stored in this database will
548.399,4.081,be assigned to a key
550.0,4.08,to store data you provide a key and a
552.48,4.72,blob of data such as an
554.08,5.28,image text file json object etc
557.2,2.99,once saved to retrieve the data just
559.36,2.08,provide the key
560.19,3.329,[Music]
561.44,4.079,key value database are very useful to
563.519,4.641,store certain types of data
565.519,3.521,such as configuration data state
568.16,3.04,information
569.04,4.0,or any data that might be represented by
571.2,3.36,a dictionary or a hash in a programming
573.04,4.16,language
574.56,5.76,examples can be redis database memcache
577.2,3.12,database etc
581.279,3.601,document database also called as
583.279,4.321,document store
584.88,4.72,these are these also use unique key to
587.6,4.799,identify data stored in database
589.6,3.84,however unlike key value store document
592.399,2.88,database store
593.44,4.48,data in structured format called
595.279,6.0,documents often using json
597.92,5.039,vsan or xml format
601.279,3.761,though each document within this
602.959,4.0,database has structured data
605.04,4.16,there is no specific format to be
606.959,4.56,followed for all documents
609.2,4.24,each document can have its own structure
611.519,4.32,which the database understands
613.44,4.399,so unlike key value store the data
615.839,4.0,stored in document database can be
617.839,6.961,queried and analyzed
619.839,4.961,examples can be mongodb couchdb etc
624.959,4.32,graph database graph database falls
627.6,3.2,under the bracket of non-relational
629.279,3.201,database and follows a different
630.8,3.44,approach to forming relationships
632.48,3.52,between data
634.24,3.12,rather than using tables and foreign
636.0,3.76,keys to form relation
637.36,4.96,graph database forms relation by using
639.76,4.639,nodes edges and properties
642.32,3.68,data is represented through individual
644.399,4.801,nodes and each node can have
646.0,5.36,multiple properties between these nodes
649.2,3.52,edges or relationships are established
651.36,3.919,to represent different types of
652.72,2.559,connections
656.64,3.439,hence in a graph database data is stored
659.36,2.719,as node
660.079,3.361,and relationships are represented
662.079,2.961,through edges
663.44,3.28,if you are working with data where
665.04,3.2,relationships or connections between
666.72,4.32,data are most important
668.24,4.719,then graph database is the right choice
671.04,3.68,graph database is useful when searching
672.959,3.44,for specific pattern like fraud
674.72,5.44,detection through money laundering
676.399,6.241,transactions etc example can be neo4j
680.16,2.48,database
683.44,4.88,white column database also known as
686.24,4.24,column family database
688.32,4.0,white column database store data using
690.48,2.799,rows and columns but they do not use
692.32,3.12,tables
693.279,4.24,instead of tables they use structure
695.44,4.24,called as column families
697.519,3.76,column families contain rows of data
699.68,4.88,where each row has its own
701.279,5.361,structure or schema each row comprises
704.56,5.2,of unique row identifier and
706.64,4.96,sets of column names and values each row
709.76,4.56,can have different number of columns
711.6,3.2,with different types of data examples
714.32,15.84,can be
714.8,17.44,cassandra edge base etc
730.16,2.08,you
