0.03,7.05,Oh rendering the most satisfying part
3.81,6.119,when ething the render button have you
7.08,5.309,ever wonder why rendering takes so long
9.929,5.431,today I'm gonna take a look at how does
12.389,5.671,rendering actually works we're going to
15.36,6.21,take a look at offline rendering and not
18.06,7.049,real-time so every treaty scene has some
21.57,5.789,objects and a camera the camera will be
25.109,5.91,what we will use to actually render a
27.359,6.661,frame or an image has a render the
31.019,5.761,camera has basically a position in space
34.02,5.94,and therefore here will have a cube
36.78,6.27,render to it we send to each pixels of
39.96,5.849,the camera some rays here in blue the
43.05,6.21,rays is basically colliding to infinity
45.809,6.27,let's take a ray that intersect with an
49.26,5.7,object that means that you send the ray
52.079,4.71,in red right here and eventually the ray
54.96,5.07,will collide through an object in the
56.789,5.731,scene here being the cube for every
60.03,5.85,pixels you send the ray and when a ray
62.52,5.82,it's an object you will send bunch of
65.88,6.059,other race mostly in the shapes of Emma
68.34,6.48,sphere all of those sub rays needs to it
71.939,5.871,a point when a light source is emitted
74.82,5.61,here is the light source then we
77.81,5.169,intersect with a cube and send bunch of
80.43,4.77,rays and the green one will eat the
82.979,5.581,light source that means that you now
85.2,5.309,have to process the thing another use
88.56,4.62,case will be to send the Ray on a plane
90.509,5.07,and then shoot many other rays let's say
93.18,4.229,you have a cube that basically reflects
95.579,4.591,some spot light on it because it has a
97.409,4.621,reflectance once the Ray from the plane
100.17,4.86,intersects with the cube the spot light
102.03,6.36,emits a source of light all those yield
105.03,5.729,yellow rays will basically be computed
108.39,5.96,to be reflected onto the simple
110.759,3.591,intersect point on the plane
