1.8,6.0,how does the web work now maybe you're
5.279,4.32,now thinking what's this question of
7.8,3.959,course I know how the web works well
9.599,4.11,maybe you do but maybe you're all
11.759,3.811,leaving out some important parts in this
13.709,2.971,video and then the article which you
15.57,3.33,find below the video in the video
16.68,4.53,description also I will have a look at
18.9,4.619,how to web works which different pieces
21.21,4.229,are involved and how that influences
23.519,3.24,what you if you want to become a web
25.439,3.66,developer or if you were simply
26.759,4.68,interested into the topic should learn
29.099,4.111,and should be aware of now as always if
31.439,3.661,you're liking this I'd love to welcome
33.21,4.02,you as a subscriber please share the
35.1,5.72,video and the usual stuff with that
37.23,3.59,let's lose no time and dive right in
45.03,5.01,with that let's start with the basic the
48.0,4.64,most common scenario your wizarding a
50.04,6.38,web page like our web page academy.com
52.64,8.97,so you fire up your browser you enter
56.42,5.19,HTTP www.calculated.com/support
71.72,5.41,the website is stored on some server so
75.93,3.36,the website you are seeing is either
77.13,4.32,generated dynamically there or the code
79.29,5.43,for it was actually stored there already
81.45,5.419,and is returned back because your
84.72,5.09,browser in the end is just an
86.869,5.291,interpreter you could say that gets back
89.81,4.15,certain source code to which I will come
92.16,3.959,back in a second and it can display that
93.96,4.17,on the screen and that source code could
96.119,4.651,ever be stored on the server already or
98.13,4.2,it's generated by the server but one
100.77,5.31,important question at this point of time
102.33,7.02,already is how does the server know that
106.08,4.29,we do mean it the server by entering
109.35,3.24,academy.com
110.37,4.11,is this the address of the server just
112.59,5.25,like your street and house number is
114.48,6.24,your address actually not the official
117.84,5.34,address of each server is an IP IP
120.72,4.74,stands for Internet Protocol address and
123.18,5.839,an IP address looks something like this
125.46,5.82,or in a more modern version like this
129.019,4.091,this is of course not something you
131.28,3.75,would want to enter into your browser
133.11,4.26,but you could do it actually you could
135.03,4.11,enter such a address if you knew it into
137.37,3.96,the browser and visit a website with
139.14,4.319,just said address but of course the
141.33,4.35,domain as this other thing here is
143.459,4.711,called it's much more human readable and
145.68,4.98,therefore the actual thirst thing that
148.17,6.27,happens when you enter this is that your
150.66,6.84,browser contacts a DNS domain name
154.44,4.44,system server which is basically like a
157.5,3.45,huge dictionary
158.88,4.56,where each domain name is mapped to an
160.95,4.819,IP you could say and then they offered
163.44,5.73,this DNS server translates your
165.769,6.131,academy.com domain into an IP address
169.17,5.1,this IP address is then given to the
171.9,4.41,browser and with that the browser can
174.27,4.23,actually make that request to the server
176.31,4.2,which has the IP address the
178.5,4.44,there Azzam as I mentioned we have where
180.51,5.04,we generate the source code for the
182.94,5.13,website and then this is sent back to
185.55,5.46,the browser where this website is now
188.07,5.31,displayed that is how this works in a
191.01,6.84,nutshell now the part where you enter
193.38,7.62,the URL so academy.com and you send this
197.85,6.39,off to the internet that is called a
201.0,5.55,request the browser makes a request for
204.24,5.07,this page and a request is like a
206.55,5.82,package of theta where this URL is one
209.31,4.95,part but another part would be the type
212.37,3.9,of request because it turns out there
214.26,4.59,are different types which you for
216.27,4.59,example use for getting a website or for
218.85,3.75,storing some data in the web so if you
220.86,4.32,submit a forum you send a different type
222.6,4.47,of request for example a request could
225.18,3.93,then also include that data you want to
227.07,3.99,send or it includes no data if you're
229.11,4.62,only requesting something or only want
231.06,5.88,to get something it can also contain
233.73,5.37,some metadata so called headers you can
236.94,4.47,always have a look at a request if you
239.1,4.41,go into a browser open the developer
241.41,5.1,tools in there which every browser has
243.51,5.37,and then in the network tab you inspect
246.51,5.49,the request that is being sent and there
248.88,5.07,you will see all the the metadata is on
252.0,3.93,that was attached to the requests always
253.95,4.529,interesting to see that now what you're
255.93,4.26,getting back is a response that is all
258.479,4.111,the data package in the end and you can
260.19,4.89,also inspect that and this all again
262.59,4.8,contains some metadata maybe and most
265.08,4.68,importantly for a traditional website
267.39,4.74,the HTML code that should be rendered
269.76,3.75,HTML code is something we haven't heard
272.13,4.56,before but that's essentially that
273.51,5.46,source code that is displayed or that is
276.69,5.34,turned into what you see on the screen
278.97,5.49,why the browser and that takes us to the
282.03,4.44,involved technologies already what you
284.46,4.5,see in the browser is the result of a
286.47,5.04,combination of HTML CSS and JavaScript
288.96,4.769,these are the free languages or
291.51,6.03,technologies involved in getting onto
293.729,7.651,the screen what you see now HTML stands
297.54,7.17,for hypertext markup language and that
301.38,5.34,gives a website its structure it doesn't
304.71,3.51,say anything about the styling it just
306.72,2.97,says what should be a heading what
308.22,3.24,should be a paragraph what should be an
309.69,2.67,input what should be a button that is
311.46,3.179,what you say with
312.36,5.339,EML and the browser is able to read that
314.639,4.68,because it's a standardized format now
317.699,3.571,of course the website should also look
319.319,5.07,good and that is done with CSS which
321.27,6.449,stands for cascading style sheets CSS is
324.389,5.881,responsible for turning a text read
327.719,5.341,giving a Batna certain look and you as a
330.27,5.369,developer can write that CSS code just
333.06,4.53,as you write the HTML code to get the
335.639,4.201,result you want by the way I also
337.59,4.139,mentioned that a server might generate
339.84,4.49,that dynamically with that I meant that
341.729,6.21,it might generate the HTML code
344.33,7.209,dynamically and that with that it
347.939,5.521,actually gives you a different code back
351.539,3.9,for different requests that is something
353.46,3.569,an online shop needs for example where
355.439,4.111,you might want to display the card
357.029,4.621,content this is part of the response and
359.55,4.679,that is only possible if that response
361.65,5.31,that HTML code is generated dynamically
364.229,4.59,on the server now we're not diving into
366.96,3.239,how this works here but you as a
368.819,4.021,developer if you were building that
370.199,5.071,website you simply define rules and on
372.84,3.9,how the code should be generated how it
375.27,2.97,should look like and when which code
376.74,3.78,should be generated this is all we need
378.24,4.5,to know right now the third language
380.52,4.53,that is involved is JavaScript and
382.74,4.32,JavaScript is responsible for all the
385.05,4.41,logic all the dynamics things that
387.06,4.529,happen in the browser if you have a
389.46,4.169,drop-down if you have tabs if you have
391.589,4.83,like that overlay that opens sometimes
393.629,4.801,or a sliding in navigation that all is
396.419,4.021,powered by JavaScript it's basically
398.43,4.229,responsible for everything that changes
400.44,6.33,in the browser after the page has been
402.659,6.81,loaded now all that data transfer as I
406.77,4.739,said is also standardized it is for
409.469,4.141,example standardized how a request and
411.509,4.02,response should look like that is all
413.61,4.589,defined by the technology used which is
415.529,3.36,HTTP which stands for hypertext Transfer
418.199,3.571,Protocol
418.889,5.64,there are also HTTPS which is the same
421.77,4.799,just in an encrypted form and all modern
424.529,5.841,web sites including academy.com
426.569,5.07,use HTTP actually so that all data is
430.37,3.069,encrypted
431.639,3.24,hence the request that you're sending
433.439,3.66,and the response you're sending is
434.879,4.56,end-to-end encrypted so the browser and
437.099,3.901,the server know how to decrypt it but in
439.439,4.04,between it's encrypted
441.0,4.94,and if someone were to sniff your
443.479,4.731,connection which is technically Paul
445.94,4.979,then these people will only see some
448.21,4.269,unreadable content so they can't read
450.919,3.511,which data you were sending or which
452.479,4.801,data you are getting back this is what
454.43,4.769,HTTPS is it's a standard that defines
457.28,4.08,how a request should look like and in
459.199,4.711,the case of HTTPS that it has to be
461.36,5.369,encrypted and the encryption is then
463.91,5.4,done by the browser and by the server so
466.729,5.31,these are the core technologies involved
469.31,5.07,there also are more technologies because
472.039,4.741,for example if on the server side we're
474.38,3.87,generating this page dynamically then
476.78,2.94,this of course means that on the server
478.25,4.53,side there needs to be some code that
479.72,7.319,runs and that is done with languages
482.78,6.44,like nodejs PHP Python and there also
487.039,4.681,are frameworks that could be used there
489.22,4.449,frameworks are basically packages of
491.72,4.169,utility functions that also give you
493.669,4.291,some rules on how to use them that make
495.889,3.78,writing code simply easier because you
497.96,3.66,don't have to reinvent the wheel for all
499.669,3.99,the nitty-gritty details you can focus
501.62,4.229,on your business logic and things like
503.659,4.861,parsing incoming requests and so on is
505.849,4.261,done by such a framework so that you
508.52,3.45,don't have to manually go through all
510.11,3.63,the lines of an incoming request you
511.97,3.869,instead just get the finished parse data
513.74,3.81,and you didn't write the logic but do
515.839,3.51,with that data instead of writing the
517.55,3.989,parsing logic which would always be the
519.349,4.891,same such frameworks by the way all
521.539,4.711,exist for the front end where you might
524.24,3.99,have applications where a lot of stuff
526.25,4.44,is happening with the help of JavaScript
528.23,4.77,to provide a nicer user experience where
530.69,4.56,you don't always need to fetch new pages
533.0,3.93,for every click the user does but where
535.25,4.02,you want to show an overlay where you
536.93,4.71,want to change content on the page while
539.27,4.14,the user is on the page and that is then
541.64,4.05,also made easier with such frameworks
543.41,4.169,for the same reason as on the server
545.69,4.649,that you don't have to write the logic
547.579,4.861,on how the change happens on the page
550.339,4.171,but instead you just write a logic for
552.44,3.63,what should change when and the
554.51,4.11,framework takes over and dusty
556.07,5.1,heavy-lifting so frameworks all's an
558.62,4.2,important part of web development but of
561.17,3.57,course a part that is typically hidden
562.82,4.35,away from you if you're just visiting
564.74,4.95,pages just as the other technologies I
567.17,4.74,guess now that is how the web works in a
569.69,4.71,nutshell but the web is more than just
571.91,4.71,traditional websites it's more than just
574.4,5.039,HTML code getting sent back and
576.62,4.799,displayed on the page with that
579.439,4.86,I mean that for example if you're having
581.419,5.61,a mobile app twitter facebook Instagram
584.299,4.89,doesn't matter you also of course have
587.029,4.53,content that's not stored on your device
589.189,6.031,but somewhere in the Internet let's say
591.559,6.15,pictures posted Barbara users there you
595.22,4.769,don't actually get back HTML pages that
597.709,4.68,contain these pictures but instead only
599.989,4.32,data is exchanged and it is important to
602.389,4.71,understand that with the web we don't
604.309,4.56,just mean websites but we basically mean
607.099,3.96,any interaction where you have some
608.869,4.86,computer called a server which sits
611.059,4.68,somewhere out there in the internet not
613.729,4.35,in your room and you are communicating
615.739,4.5,with that server not actively but in
618.079,4.02,actively so indirectly your your app
620.239,3.84,communicates with that your website a
622.099,4.77,website might send the request get back
624.079,5.16,a response with HTML now that request
626.869,5.01,response pattern is always the same but
629.239,5.55,actually a mobile app for example sends
631.879,5.01,a request but doesn't want HTML as a
634.789,4.44,response and it clearly says that in the
636.889,4.77,request instead it wants something which
639.229,4.8,typically is called JSON data that's a
641.659,4.02,specific data format and we don't need
644.029,3.84,to dive into the details there right now
645.679,5.16,but there the server responds with a
647.869,4.77,data package which is not parsable by
650.839,4.381,the browser so it's not something that
652.639,5.31,would be converted into a visual website
655.22,5.369,by a browser but by the app the app
657.949,4.53,which people wrote like Instagram the
660.589,4.23,source code behind the app knows how to
662.479,4.8,parse that incoming response and how to
664.819,5.281,handle that if that for example are five
667.279,5.16,new posts by people you're following
670.1,4.559,well then that is converted into
672.439,3.75,something you can see on the screen with
674.659,3.96,the hub of the source code written by
676.189,4.35,the developers of the app so that is
678.619,4.05,also where we have the internet same
680.539,4.32,request response pattern but the data
682.669,3.03,which is exchanged is different it's not
684.859,3.84,a HTML page
685.699,6.63,it's a ver form of data so the data
688.699,5.401,format is flexible the core idea that we
692.329,3.72,have code running on a server and code
694.1,4.739,running on our device no matter if it's
696.049,7.05,a mobile phone or if it's a browser that
698.839,6.27,core idea is always the same now there
703.099,4.35,also are more advanced technologies for
705.109,3.991,example for real-time communication
707.449,4.23,where you don't have request response
709.1,4.24,but where the server can actively push a
711.679,3.581,new message to the client
713.34,4.2,so the client never sent a request but
715.26,3.6,gets new data anyways through an
717.54,3.75,established connection with the
718.86,5.72,technology named WebSockets but that's
721.29,6.63,even more advanced it exists though I
724.58,4.66,hope that nonetheless with this you
727.92,2.13,might have learned something which you
729.24,3.3,already knew
730.05,4.65,well doesn't hurt them I hope I didn't
732.54,3.66,steal too much of your time but you also
734.7,4.47,might have learned something which you
736.2,6.24,only Whaley knew before which now is a
739.17,6.86,bit clearer hopefully hopefully see you
742.44,3.59,in other videos too bye
