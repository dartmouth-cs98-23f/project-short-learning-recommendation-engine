web-based and non-web-based transaction
processing systems
a brief overview so we're going to take
a look at the two classifications of
these types of transaction processing
systems
side by side so firstly is web-based
where the storage location of the
database
file is accessed by the internet in
order to connect to a server
so you need to be connected to the
internet if you're going to access this
system
and that's how you'll get to the server
there probably are areas on site too
where you can access the actual server
as well
but predominantly it has internet
connection and thus users from over the
world
could connect to this actual web-based
tps on the flip side a non-web-based tps
means that the database file is stored
locally on the system or more so
accessed through a local area network
to a specific server so it can be on a
network
just the network is not on the internet
to connect to that server
you've got to have some sort of land set
up with wired or wireless mediums
and hardware set up to connect you to
that server so it's more of a private
network
so if we look at this visually on the
web-based side we have our computer
we need to connect the internet and
through the internet we can connect to a
server
whereas with the non-web-based tps i've
got my system
and it connects to the server through
the network makeup that i'm using
so let's look at the advantages and
disadvantages of web-based and look the
big advantage
of this is the systems database can be
accessed from all over the world
through the internet and this is great
if you've got a commercial business that
you're working with
because you could have customers all
over the world accessing a site signing
up to it and entering their own details
in order to become a part of your
service
and they can all do that through the
internet and you're going to see
access is everything really with the
difference between web-based and
non-web-based because on the
disadvantaged side of things
it's prone to a higher security risk due
to the internet technologies you've got
more entry points through the internet
for hackers to get into the system so
that's a disadvantage of it there
also access is dependent on the internet
being online so if the internet does go
down
we can't access the actual network if
we're working from
home or whatever especially if i'm a
participant of this system and i need to
use the internet to get through to it in
order to do my work for the company i'm
with
on the flip side for the non-web-based
tps the advantages are the higher
security
due to the limited access to the actual
server
okay because it is within a private
network there is more control there
of course there's always ways to get in
but it doesn't have a global access as
is the case with a web-based tps
which works to its favor in relation to
security okay but then on the
disadvantaged side of things
you need to be within the side of the
network in order to access the actual
system
alright so you've got to be within that
lan okay or a private when in order to
get into that system
okay in order to access the server you
can't be accessing it from home
because at home you are not near the
place of works
system so it's not possible there so i
hope this gives you just an idea of the
differences between
the two types of categories of web-based
and non-web-based tps's and essentially
it all comes down to the internet
one you can use the internet to get into
the system the other it's more likely a
private network
