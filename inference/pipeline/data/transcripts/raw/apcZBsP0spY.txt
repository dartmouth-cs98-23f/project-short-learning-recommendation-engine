0.64,4.4,hello everybody and welcome to another
2.96,3.839,lecture on computer architecture
5.04,3.28,today i want to talk to you about
6.799,4.001,quantum computing
8.32,4.399,something that is well not state of the
10.8,2.32,art it is more like beyond state of the
12.719,4.32,art
13.12,6.319,it is into still in the development
17.039,3.601,phase so it's not even clear if it's
19.439,3.281,going to work
20.64,4.559,but let me try to explain to you what is
22.72,6.08,going on and why it would be phenomenal
25.199,6.4,if it really works
28.8,4.32,so the first thing i want to actually uh
31.599,5.441,i want to tell you what it is
33.12,6.959,actually based on what do we have
37.04,4.96,is um that
40.079,4.48,in a normal computer we have let's say
42.0,5.12,an and gate in which every bit
44.559,4.801,there it enters and it has the bit can
47.12,4.88,have two values it's either
49.36,4.719,one or it is zero and that is then
52.0,4.239,linked to a physical property so for
54.079,5.441,instance the zero is zero volts
56.239,6.0,and the one is five volts or maybe
59.52,3.6,uh the zero is that the capacitor is
62.239,3.521,charged
63.12,4.64,and uh one is that the capacitor is
65.76,4.24,empty or the other way around
67.76,3.12,whatever but with quantum computing
70.0,4.24,there is something
70.88,7.44,strange going on because the bits
74.24,6.48,that we put at the input cannot have
78.32,3.839,either one of the two values but it can
80.72,3.6,have two values
82.159,4.96,at the same time and that is something
84.32,6.4,very strange but that comes from
87.119,5.281,quantum mechanics so the idea is
90.72,3.68,that you have an object of physical
92.4,5.2,property that can have
94.4,4.56,various states so we can for instance
97.6,3.44,take here
98.96,3.6,the classic example is that you can have
101.04,3.92,here an electron spin
102.56,4.559,and as you know well maybe not but the
104.96,4.08,electron spin it can either rotate in
107.119,4.161,one direction let's say here
109.04,3.2,counterclockwise or this is this is
111.28,2.0,clockwise
112.24,3.36,and the other one would be
113.28,3.519,counterclockwise and we could for
115.6,4.32,instance say well
116.799,5.761,we can just say that counterclockwise
119.92,4.32,would be zero and clockwise would be one
122.56,2.64,so maybe we call this one here on the
124.24,3.44,left we call it
125.2,3.36,uh then one and the other one on the
127.68,2.24,right
128.56,3.679,and we call it a zero and then we're
129.92,4.319,going to make some kind of they arrive
132.239,3.601,at our end gate and we're going to do
134.239,4.401,some kind of
135.84,3.92,well boolean logic with that but the
138.64,4.16,thing is
139.76,6.72,that in quantum mechanics
142.8,6.32,the electron state is not defined
146.48,4.16,spin up or spin down is not defined
149.12,4.88,until it is measured
150.64,6.08,and it is not so that the
154.0,4.239,state of the spin is not known to us but
156.72,4.32,it is a certain state it
158.239,4.161,is up or down but only it's not observed
161.04,3.76,by me
162.4,4.88,no that would be classical mechanics
164.8,5.6,classical physics but in quantum physics
167.28,5.76,it is like this that no the state
170.4,4.24,is not defined until it is measured
173.04,5.199,until it is so-called
174.64,6.72,observed so then before you observe it
178.239,3.761,it is like you know mr schroedinger's
181.36,3.68,cat
182.0,5.36,it is both the cat of mr uh
185.04,4.72,both that that and the life at the same
187.36,5.28,time at the same time the same way
189.76,3.759,the spin of the electron is both up and
192.64,4.56,down
193.519,5.681,at the same time and that means that uh
197.2,3.679,and when we start observing it then the
199.2,3.6,spin so-called it
200.879,4.161,the wave function as we call it it
202.8,6.159,collapses so only when we observe it
205.04,6.96,the spin becomes up or down
208.959,6.321,and if you think this concept is strange
212.0,7.04,i would like to remind you of mr
215.28,5.28,the famous talk of mr feynman
219.04,3.279,where he said if you think you
220.56,4.399,understand quantum mechanics
222.319,4.721,you don't understand quantum mechanics
224.959,4.081,and this is how weird actually this you
227.04,5.52,can make these weird
229.04,5.44,phrases and actually being right on top
232.56,3.52,i really recommend you to watch if
234.48,2.24,you're interested into these kind of
236.08,3.2,things
236.72,3.76,the lecture series of mr richard feynman
239.28,2.08,it's in black and white very
240.48,2.8,old-fashioned
241.36,3.28,but the quality i think is not been
243.28,5.36,surpassed by any
244.64,6.08,uh any person from physics
248.64,3.92,since that time so this black and white
250.72,4.4,videos are perfect and
252.56,4.48,there he says i think the lectures are
255.12,3.28,called the character of physical nature
257.04,3.199,or something like this
258.4,3.28,but anyway there he says nobody
260.239,5.041,understands quantum
261.68,6.799,mechanics that is mr feynman saying that
265.28,5.28,so in quantum mechanics the state is not
268.479,5.201,defined until we observe it
270.56,5.359,and until the time the state is in
273.68,3.6,the wave function is in a superposition
275.919,4.0,state so it is both
277.28,3.359,spin up and spin down at the same time
279.919,3.601,when we use
280.639,4.321,electrons so how can we use this now to
283.52,4.959,make a quantum
284.96,6.959,computer well we take these
288.479,4.561,two things so let me put it back here
291.919,3.201,let me say it like this
293.04,3.04,so we have generally we have a wave
295.12,4.639,function
296.08,6.88,that that a bit a at the entrance of
299.759,5.041,our gate it would be both
302.96,3.679,in the spin up and the spin down state
304.8,2.16,because we didn't observe it yet but
306.639,2.881,we're
306.96,4.079,already going to do calculations with
309.52,3.92,this wave function
311.039,4.0,before observing it so we apply the wave
313.44,4.64,function to our gate
315.039,4.16,and then we are doing simultaneously the
318.08,4.24,calculations
319.199,4.401,with the spin up state as well as the
322.32,3.52,spin down state
323.6,3.28,so one bit of information actually i
325.84,3.919,should say this
326.88,3.36,one bit arriving at your gate actually
329.759,4.401,has
330.24,7.2,two bits of processing
334.16,6.56,information now how does we then
337.44,5.92,do this if we take two bits then we have
340.72,4.88,four calculations doing at the same time
343.36,4.72,and if we have 100 bits
345.6,3.599,then we do 2 to the power 100
348.08,2.959,calculations
349.199,3.601,at the same time because we didn't
351.039,3.361,collapse the wave function yet
352.8,3.6,and to give you an idea then just a
354.4,4.56,simple computer of
356.4,4.72,100 bits so maybe we would have
358.96,6.32,something like this i think this is the
361.12,7.519,ibm quantum computing machine
365.28,5.759,and you can see well it's quite complex
368.639,4.4,maybe this has 100 bits i guess this
371.039,4.0,entire thing has to be cooled down to
373.039,3.681,liquid helium or something like this
375.039,4.16,because it looks to me that this one
376.72,5.599,will be embedded into
379.199,3.681,into some kind of cooling vessel because
382.319,3.521,of this
382.88,4.0,you can see this thermal shields that
385.84,2.72,are there and then
386.88,3.68,the electronic wires that come here
388.56,4.0,through here and through loops
390.56,3.84,so that the thermal conductivity is not
392.56,3.919,so high and here at the bottom
394.4,3.76,then the calculation is done at very low
396.479,3.201,temperature because then you have
398.16,2.0,apparently you can do this quantum
399.68,2.16,states
400.16,3.28,well you can imagine that this thing
401.84,4.56,must cost a fortune
403.44,4.0,but if you have 100 bits then you can do
406.4,5.12,2 to the power
407.44,6.56,100 calculations in simultaneous
411.52,4.48,simultaneously and to give you an idea
414.0,3.919,that is about 2 to the power 100 is
416.0,5.28,about 10 to the power 30.
417.919,5.761,so if you do one calculation per second
421.28,3.759,effectively you're doing 10 to the power
423.68,4.16,30
425.039,3.521,calculations per second and that is then
427.84,3.919,about
428.56,4.24,10 to the power 20 10 gigahertz scores
431.759,3.121,in parallel
432.8,4.0,so you can get the idea as if you have
434.88,5.28,10 to the power 20
436.8,5.2,very strong computers working uh in
440.16,4.4,in parallel i don't think that there are
442.0,5.759,so many computers in the world
444.56,3.759,and actually in the this would be it's
447.759,3.521,like
448.319,5.201,astronomical amounts of processing power
451.28,4.72,if you just have 100 bits
453.52,3.92,to be honest i'm quite skeptical but i'm
456.0,3.44,just explaining to you
457.44,3.52,how it works to be honest i'm quite
459.44,4.8,skeptical because
460.96,6.0,obviously nature didn't do this and
464.24,3.28,and the advantages would be very well in
466.96,4.0,nature
467.52,5.519,imagine that you're a lion or
470.96,3.44,actually you're the prey of the lion it
473.039,4.321,would be if you have such
474.4,3.919,calculating power in your brain or
477.36,3.04,somehow
478.319,3.681,then of course you would be able to
480.4,2.32,predict let's say the future for the
482.0,3.12,next uh
482.72,3.36,one or two hours uh with high precision
485.12,4.0,so you could be
486.08,6.32,able to either avoid the lion or as
489.12,6.24,when you're the lion you could easily
492.4,4.0,catch your prey so i'm very skeptical
495.36,4.48,that it works
496.4,5.68,but this is the principle of
499.84,4.079,of how it works so that is quantum
502.08,5.36,computing it might be
503.919,6.241,that this will then be the end of
507.44,3.439,things like bitcoin or blockchain in
510.16,3.679,general
510.879,3.761,cryptography because you can instantly
513.839,3.76,calculate
514.64,3.92,all the possible cryptographic
517.599,4.081,possibilities
518.56,5.44,so decrypting is actually then a
521.68,4.32,piece of cake so see you in the next
524.0,4.24,lecture well i will talk about
526.0,4.48,a clockless computer so i will actually
528.24,4.64,talk about your brain which doesn't have
530.48,4.96,a clock as you know see you in the next
532.88,2.56,lecture
