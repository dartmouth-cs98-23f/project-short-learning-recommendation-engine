0.4,4.56,dave and ryan are two computer engineers
2.8,4.479,and best friends who decide to play the
4.96,4.559,game of flip the coin on dave's computer
7.279,5.121,with the computer being the opponent and
9.519,5.2,ryan decides to observe his game
12.4,4.0,the computer plays the first move but
14.719,3.201,dave doesn't know what it was either
16.4,3.6,heads or tails
17.92,5.439,now on his turn he can either choose to
20.0,5.279,flip the coin or not and similarly even
23.359,3.281,if his results will not be revealed to
25.279,3.681,the computer
26.64,4.16,now again the turn goes to the computer
28.96,4.08,and after playing a few rounds the
30.8,5.279,computer reveals the result
33.04,5.6,while observing all this ryan says
36.079,5.361,hey do you know that there is only a 50
38.64,6.079,chance that either of you will win
41.44,5.279,dave got curious he asked how he knew
44.719,4.401,ryan explained that it's a computer and
46.719,4.16,he just tried to analyze its moves but
49.12,3.36,suddenly he says
50.879,4.401,what are your chances if you play the
52.48,5.12,same game on quantum computer
55.28,5.84,dave was confused and asked what is a
57.6,5.92,quantum computer and how is it different
61.12,4.96,quantum computers are advanced machines
63.52,5.2,inspired by quantum physics a study of
66.08,5.12,the behavior of atoms and particles
68.72,4.24,so quantum computers operate by studying
71.2,2.88,and controlling the behavior of these
72.96,3.36,particles
74.08,4.64,which in a way completely is different
76.32,3.68,from our regular computers or even super
78.72,3.6,computers
80.0,4.64,it is an upgraded and powerful version
82.32,4.479,of these computers but not exactly the
84.64,4.32,next generation computers
86.799,3.921,like bikes you cannot build a better
88.96,3.6,bike just by building and adding more
90.72,3.92,and more cycles together
92.56,3.44,although they both share almost the same
94.64,4.56,functioning
96.0,5.28,dave further questions how does it work
99.2,4.239,ryan comes forward and explains to dave
101.28,4.799,that while playing flip the coin his
103.439,5.36,computer took heads and tails as bits of
106.079,3.841,0 and 1 and depends on only these two
108.799,2.881,results
109.92,4.32,while the quantum computer on the other
111.68,4.56,hand will also have these possibilities
114.24,4.8,including a possibility of a mixture of
116.24,5.28,both heads and tails like zero and one
119.04,4.32,for example with some portion of zero
121.52,4.639,and some portion of one
123.36,4.8,and due to this fluid possibility it
126.159,3.041,increases the chances of you losing the
128.16,2.56,game
129.2,3.52,because whether you choose to flip the
130.72,4.8,coin or not the outcome will still be
132.72,4.56,there between both possibilities
135.52,2.64,just like a mixture of lemon juice and
137.28,2.48,water
138.16,4.32,even though the portion of lemon juice
139.76,4.8,is very little in that mixture you can't
142.48,3.839,say that it is not there
144.56,4.16,this property of superposition and
146.319,4.56,entanglement of quantum physics empowers
148.72,4.4,quantum computers to handle operations
150.879,4.881,at speeds that are orders of magnitude
153.12,4.96,faster than traditional computers while
155.76,4.8,using a fraction of the energy upon
158.08,5.36,understanding this dave was mesmerized
160.56,5.6,by the concept of quantum computers
163.44,5.28,quantum computers aims to revolutionize
166.16,4.4,more future quantum technologies
168.72,4.48,and just like other transformations
170.56,5.36,around the world quantum computers have
173.2,5.2,the potential to impact our lives in so
175.92,5.12,many ways like our security needs
178.4,5.04,healthcare needs etc
181.04,4.24,for example it can be used to create
183.44,3.84,private keys for encrypting messages
185.28,3.52,from one location to another
187.28,3.52,it can be difficult for people with
188.8,3.76,ulterior motives to copy the key of
190.8,3.439,quantum uncertainty
192.56,4.399,this type of unique and unbreakable
194.239,5.601,encryption is already tested by banks
196.959,4.881,and companies like jp morgan wells fargo
199.84,4.24,barclays etc
201.84,4.24,it can be used in the medicinal world as
204.08,4.079,it will be easier for quantum computers
206.08,4.239,to study each property of atoms and
208.159,3.601,molecules as it works on a similar
210.319,2.241,concept
211.76,2.559,so
212.56,3.759,here is a question for you
214.319,3.84,what makes quantum computers different
216.319,2.64,from supercomputers
218.159,2.8,a
218.959,4.56,atoms and molecules
220.959,3.36,b uncertainty of outcomes
223.519,2.161,c
224.319,2.321,algorithm
225.68,2.72,d
226.64,3.519,none of the above
228.4,4.0,please give it a thought and drop your
230.159,4.321,answers in the comments section below
232.4,3.6,three lucky winners will receive amazon
234.48,4.08,gift vouchers
236.0,5.2,due to its benefits currently it is
238.56,3.759,connected to over 17 billion devices
241.2,3.28,globally
242.319,4.321,quantum computers are the future of our
244.48,4.24,coming generations although it is still
246.64,4.08,under research work it is still taking
248.72,2.879,over the technology and the business
250.72,2.799,world
251.599,4.161,companies like google and microsoft are
253.519,3.28,competing to build quantum computing
255.76,2.879,tools
256.799,3.601,this progress could allow some of the
258.639,4.401,benefits and insights of quantum
260.4,4.64,computation to be realized long before
263.04,4.24,the search for a large-scale
265.04,5.04,error-corrected quantum computer is
267.28,4.88,complete we hope you enjoyed this video
