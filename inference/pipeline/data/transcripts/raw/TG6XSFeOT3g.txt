second,duration,transcript
0.0,4.38,so if you're on coding YouTube a lot
2.399,3.9,you're going to see a lot of videos that
4.38,3.419,have the title how I'd learned to code
6.299,3.121,if I could do it all over again
7.799,3.541,personally I think that there's a lot of
9.42,3.42,BS in these videos and I think that for
11.34,3.179,a lot of viewers you don't know what to
12.84,3.84,do so today we're going to talk about
14.519,4.501,how I would learn how to do web
16.68,4.74,development in 2023 if I were just
19.02,4.56,starting out it's a no BS way to do it
21.42,3.66,though who am I my name is Dylan I
23.58,3.3,taught myself how to code during the
25.08,4.14,pandemic and I currently work full-time
26.88,4.02,as a programmer at a software startup on
29.22,3.539,my channel I share all the lessons that
30.9,3.9,I learned on my journey so if you're new
32.759,3.841,kick back enjoy the ride let's jump in
34.8,3.12,and if you really like this stuff make
36.6,3.779,sure to hit that subscribe button I'm
37.92,4.2,going to give a quick PSA here learning
40.379,3.84,web development learning software
42.12,3.9,engineering learning how to code does
44.219,3.481,not take three months you're going to
46.02,2.879,see a lot of videos on YouTube telling
47.7,3.06,you that you can become a Google
48.899,3.421,software engineer in three months and
50.76,3.42,make half a million dollars a year it's
52.32,3.96,not real I wouldn't believe it coding is
54.18,4.68,a lifelong learning process it takes
56.28,4.799,years to master I'm only a few years in
58.86,3.96,and I still consider my myself to be an
61.079,3.961,amateur the second thing don't do
62.82,4.02,Harvard cs50 I'm not saying that it's a
65.04,3.78,bad course but a lot of people are going
66.84,4.08,to steer you in the direction of taking
68.82,3.479,this type of course and personally I
70.92,3.3,don't think that it's needed I think
72.299,4.261,that by taking a course like Harvard
74.22,4.02,cs50 you're further just kicking the can
76.56,3.9,down the road if I were starting on day
78.24,4.8,one I would hop on free code Camp I
80.46,4.62,would start learning HTML and CSS in the
83.04,4.02,basic web design course that free cocam
85.08,4.14,offers that's what I did that's how I
87.06,4.68,learned it it only took me three weeks
89.22,4.8,to learn mind you I was really putting
91.74,3.78,the hours in every day so that's why I
94.02,3.0,got through it in three to four weeks so
95.52,2.94,I think if you're committed you can do
97.02,3.419,it in less than a month once you've
98.46,4.199,completed the web design track on
100.439,4.021,freecocamp I would go on to udemy or
102.659,3.78,something similar and take a JavaScript
104.46,3.78,course and learn the basics if I were
106.439,3.96,doing it all over again I wouldn't try
108.24,4.08,to become a JavaScript Master understand
110.399,3.601,what a JavaScript function does before
112.32,3.54,you list that you're a web developer on
114.0,3.78,your resume like can you type out a
115.86,3.42,function in the console like this is a
117.78,3.659,super basic concept that you should know
119.28,4.5,how to do this this is basic JavaScript
121.439,4.261,once you finish a basic JavaScript and
123.78,3.36,web development course on udemy I would
125.7,3.18,build a project that you're interested
127.14,3.3,in like ask yourself what are your
128.88,3.24,interests what are your passions what do
130.44,3.72,you like don't build a Netflix clone
132.12,4.08,everybody does that don't build a meta
134.16,4.14,clone everybody does that like you
136.2,3.72,should be original do something that is
138.3,4.019,unique and something that you're
139.92,4.74,passionate about not what everybody else
142.319,4.14,wants you to do an advantage of this
144.66,3.84,approach is that when you're actually
146.459,3.901,building the thing you're more likely to
148.5,3.599,enjoy what it is that you're working on
150.36,3.06,because you like the stuff that you're
152.099,3.72,working on it's something that you're
153.42,4.14,actually passionate about so for me I'm
155.819,3.841,super interested in career development
157.56,3.899,so I built a job board in vanilla
159.66,3.78,JavaScript and I really like doing that
161.459,3.661,because I'm super interested in what it
163.44,4.32,is that I was building make sure that
165.12,4.979,you do it in the language stripped of
167.76,4.559,any Frameworks this is important because
170.099,4.201,it reinforces the fundamental Basics and
172.319,3.78,understanding of the language of your
174.3,3.36,choice like you want to know the basics
176.099,3.36,like how to write a function how to
177.66,4.68,write a for Loop in JavaScript it's only
179.459,5.041,until after you've built this project in
182.34,3.899,the vanilla language of your choice that
184.5,3.72,you can build it in a framework so after
186.239,4.261,I was done building this project in
188.22,4.019,vanilla JavaScript I then decided to
190.5,4.019,rebuild the project and the framework of
192.239,4.441,my choice which was react I was able to
194.519,3.961,better understand react as a result
196.68,3.779,because like I really understood the
198.48,3.78,basics of JavaScript this is super
200.459,3.06,important because a lot of people are
202.26,2.82,going to tell you that you should
203.519,3.36,immediately start building in the
205.08,3.659,framework of your choice taking a quick
206.879,3.961,pause here this video is not about
208.739,3.661,getting a job I've made a lot of other
210.84,3.539,videos about that which I'll link up
212.4,3.36,here but I wanted to say like in my
214.379,2.881,opinion I don't think that you need to
215.76,2.94,go to a boot camp and I don't think that
217.26,3.479,you need to go back to school and get a
218.7,4.2,CS degree the main advantage of these
220.739,3.78,two options is honestly just the
222.9,3.839,structure that is provided and you could
224.519,4.201,also argue probably the community too
226.739,3.901,but all the material that is offered
228.72,3.84,it's all free and cheap on the internet
230.64,4.14,and like if you want Community just go
232.56,4.14,to a meet-up they're completely free and
234.78,3.959,Meetup organizers want as many people
236.7,4.56,there as possible let's say you have a
238.739,4.261,bug in your code like go to a Meetup and
241.26,3.839,ask people I bet that you can figure it
243.0,4.14,out at that Meetup rather than paying a
245.099,3.78,boot camp seventeen thousand dollars for
247.14,3.599,them to listen to your problems for you
248.879,3.241,a small rant there's so many options
250.739,2.7,like there's so much out there and
252.12,3.839,there's so many people trying to push
253.439,4.92,you in the direction of paying them
255.959,4.74,money so they can convince you that you
258.359,4.321,can get a job in like three months like
260.699,4.021,you might be able to by doing one of
262.68,3.9,these programs but it's highly unlikely
264.72,3.6,like you have to put the work in so my
266.58,3.36,message is this just Google it like
268.32,3.48,you're gonna have to Google it and go on
269.94,4.02,stack Overflow whether you're in a boot
271.8,3.42,camp or doing a CS degree anyways so
273.96,3.06,like you might as well just get really
275.22,3.12,good at being resourceful yourself and
277.02,3.06,like I said go to meetups for
278.34,3.48,collaboration like if you have a bug or
280.08,2.82,something go to a Meetup and I'm sure
281.82,2.939,you guys are going to be able to figure
282.9,3.9,it out you can also use other resources
284.759,3.781,like YouTube YouTube is amazing stack
286.8,3.36,Overflow is great too and as I mentioned
288.54,3.36,at the beginning of the video like
290.16,3.78,there's no hacking your brain that's all
291.9,3.48,a bunch of clickbait BS like you can't
293.94,3.66,hack your brain to learn how to code
295.38,3.96,it's a brain it's a muscle I think it's
297.6,3.3,a muscle like you have to just Google
299.34,3.54,everything saying you have to learn to
300.9,3.72,be resourceful learn how to struggle and
302.88,3.12,learn how to learn it's not about the
304.62,3.0,actual coding language or web
306.0,4.08,development technology itself it's
307.62,4.44,learning how to learn the actual Tech so
310.08,3.899,in summary if I were just starting out I
312.06,3.96,would hop on free cocamp and do the web
313.979,4.5,design course it's totally free and
316.02,3.899,you'll learn HTML and CSS if you put in
318.479,2.701,the work every single day you'll
319.919,3.181,probably be able to get through it in
321.18,3.72,three to four weeks then I would hop on
323.1,3.3,udemy and take a JavaScript Focus course
324.9,3.12,or something that's a little more
326.4,3.54,comprehensive in web development I'll
328.02,3.42,link a couple of example courses in the
329.94,3.72,description and focus on just getting
331.44,3.84,good at the basics of vanilla JavaScript
333.66,2.819,and then take all those skills that you
335.28,3.18,just learned from the last couple of
336.479,3.241,courses and build a Project based on
338.46,3.299,something that you're passionate about
339.72,3.9,don't build a Netflix clone everybody
341.759,3.181,does that you want to be original and
343.62,2.94,also the advantage of doing something
344.94,3.18,that you're interested in is that you're
346.56,3.479,more likely to keep doing it because
348.12,3.54,you're interested in doing it then when
350.039,4.141,you're done building that project in
351.66,4.379,vanilla JavaScript you can rebuild it in
354.18,3.359,the framework of your choice and lastly
356.039,3.121,you have to learn how to struggle you
357.539,3.72,have to learn how to learn go and Google
359.16,3.539,it like there's no brain hacks to this
361.259,3.061,stuff you can't hack your brain and
362.699,3.181,become more productive and learn how to
364.32,3.36,code this is stuff that people try to
365.88,3.599,sell you on the internet like it's a
367.68,3.84,brain come on you can't hack it it's not
369.479,3.72,a computer learn how to struggle and how
371.52,3.899,to gird through problems the real way
373.199,4.321,the way that everybody else does it so
375.419,4.021,don't buy into the BS anyways that is
377.52,4.2,how I would learn how to do web
379.44,4.259,development in 2023 if I were just
381.72,4.319,starting out again this is my bold take
383.699,4.021,this is what I see on YouTube and what I
386.039,3.241,disagree and agree with so if you like
387.72,3.539,this content give this video a like so
389.28,4.38,we can push it out to more people and
391.259,4.5,hopefully motivate and Inspire others I
393.66,3.9,make a lot of other videos like this so
395.759,3.121,feel free to check another one out I
397.56,2.94,appreciate any support on my channel
398.88,5.24,comment below let me know what you think
400.5,3.62,until next time peace
407.52,3.019,thank you
