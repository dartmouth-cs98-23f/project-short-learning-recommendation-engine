0.48,6.24,"What is natural language processing? Well, 
you're doing it right now, you're listening  "
6.72,6.32,"to the words and the sentences that I'm forming 
and you are forming some sort of comprehension  "
13.04,7.2,"from it. And when we ask a computer to do that 
that is NLP, or natural language processing.  "
21.28,3.6,"My name is Martin Keen, I'm 
a Master Inventor at IBM,  "
24.88,7.36,"and I've utilized NLP in a good number of 
my invention disclosures. NLP really has a  "
32.24,8.56,"really high utility value in all sorts of AI 
applications. Now NLP starts with something called  "
40.8,6.8,"unstructured text. What is that? Well, that's 
just what you and I say, that's how we speak.  "
47.6,10.24,"So, for example, some unstructured text is 
""add eggs and milk to my shopping list.""  "
59.04,8.64,"Now you and I understand exactly what that means, 
but it is unstructured at least to a computer."
71.76,5.44,"So what we need to do, is to have a structured 
representation of that same information that  "
77.2,5.04,"a computer can process. Now that might look 
something a bit more like this where we have a  "
82.88,8.32,"shopping list element. And then it has sub 
elements within it like an item for eggs,"
94.08,5.76,and an item for milk.
103.12,2.64,"That is an example of 
something that is structured."
110.0,6.24,"Now the job of natural language processing 
is to translate between these two things.  "
116.24,7.6,"So NLP sits right in the middle here translating 
between unstructured and structured data. And when  "
123.84,7.36,"we go from structure from unstructured here 
to structured this way, that's called NLU, or  "
131.2,5.76,"natural language understanding. And when we 
go this way from structured to unstructured,  "
136.96,7.44,"that's called natural language generation, 
or NLG. We're going to focus today primarily  "
144.4,5.92,"on going from unstructured to structured in 
natural language processing now let's think of  "
150.32,9.36,"some use cases where nlp might be quite handy. 
First of all, we've got machine translation."
161.84,10.88,"Now when we translate from one language to 
another we need to understand the context of  "
172.72,5.12,"that sentence. It's not just a case of taking 
each individual word from say English and  "
177.84,4.72,"then translating it into another language. We 
need to understand the overall structure  "
182.56,5.92,"and context of what's being said. And my 
favorite example of this going horribly wrong  "
188.48,6.56,"is if you take the phrase the ""spirit is willing, 
but the flesh is weak"" and you translate that from  "
195.04,5.36,"English to Russian and then you translate 
that Russian translation back into English  "
200.4,5.68,"you're going to go from the ""spirit is willing, 
but the flesh is weak"" to something a bit more  "
206.08,5.92,"like the ""vodka is good, but the meat is 
rotten"" which is really not the intended  "
212.0,7.04,"context of that sentence whatsoever. So 
NLP can help with situations like that. Now  "
219.04,7.04,"the the second kind of use case that I like 
to mention relates to virtual assistants,  "
226.08,6.96,"and also to things like chatbots. Now a virtual 
assistant that's something like Siri, or Alexa  "
233.04,8.08,"on your phone that is taking human utterances and 
deriving a command to execute based upon that. And  "
241.12,6.24,"a chatbot is something similar except in written 
language and that's taking written language and  "
247.36,6.48,"then using it to traverse a decision tree in order 
to take an action. NLP is very helpful there.  "
254.48,10.32,"Another use case is for sentiment analysis. Now 
this is taking some text perhaps an email message  "
264.8,5.6,"or a product review and trying to derive 
the sentiment that's expressed within it.  "
270.4,8.0,"So for example, is this product review a positive 
sentiment or a negative sentiment, is it written  "
278.96,7.84,"as a serious statement or is it being sarcastic? 
We can use NLP to tell us. And then finally,  "
287.6,6.88,"another good example is spam detection so this 
is a case of looking at a given email message  "
294.48,4.72,"and trying to drive is this a real email 
message or is it spam and we can look for  "
299.2,7.28,"pointers within the content of the message. So 
things like overused words or poor grammar or an  "
306.48,7.12,"inappropriate claim of urgency can all indicate 
that this is actually perhaps spam. So those are  "
313.6,7.28,"some of the things that NLP can provide but how 
does it work well the thing with NLP is it's"
320.88,7.92,"not like one algorithm, it's actually more like a 
bag of tools and you can apply these bag of tools  "
328.8,7.84,"to be able to resolve some of these use cases. 
Now the input to NLP is some unstructured text  "
336.64,6.4,"so either some written text or spoken text that 
has been converted to written text through a  "
343.04,8.8,"speech to text algorithm. Once we've got that, 
the first stage of NLP is called tokenization"
354.88,7.36,"This is about taking a string and breaking 
it down into chunks so if we consider the  "
362.24,5.76,"unstructured text we've got here ""add 
eggs and milk to my shopping list""  "
368.64,3.12,that's eight words that can be eight tokens.  
371.76,7.04,"And from here on in we are going to work one 
token at a time as we traverse through this. Now  "
378.8,5.92,"the first stage once we've got things down into 
tokens that we can perform is called stemming."
387.36,6.8,"And this is all about deriving the word stem 
for a given token. So for example, running,  "
394.16,6.72,"runs, and ran, the word stem for all three of 
those is run. We're just kind of removing the  "
400.88,4.24,"prefix and the suffixes and normalizing the 
tense and we're getting to the word stem.  "
406.08,7.44,"But stemming doesn't work well for every 
token. For example, universal and university,  "
414.56,4.96,"well they don't really stem down to 
universe. For situations like that,  "
419.52,6.72,"there is another tool that we have 
available and that is called lemmatization.  "
428.24,6.72,"And lemmatization takes a given token and learns 
its meaning through a dictionary definition  "
434.96,9.2,"and from there it can derive its root, or its lem. 
So take better for example, better is derived from  "
444.16,10.32,"good so the root, or the lem, of better is good. 
The stem of better would be bet. So you can see  "
454.48,6.72,"that it is significant whether we use stemming, 
or we use lemmatization for a given token.  "
462.88,6.32,"Now next thing we can do is we can do a 
process called part of speech tagging."
471.44,6.4,"And what this is doing is for a given token 
it's looking where that token is used within the  "
477.84,11.76,"context of a sentence. So take the word make for 
example, if I say ""I'm going to make dinner"", make  "
489.6,7.36,"is a verb. But if I ask you ""what make is your 
laptop?"", well make is now a noun. So where that  "
496.96,4.88,"token is used in the sentence matters, part of 
speech tagging can help us derive that context.  "
502.4,6.08,"And then finally, another stage 
is named entity recognition.  "
510.0,6.48,"And what this is asking is for a given token 
is there an entity associated with it. So  "
516.48,9.04,"for example, a token of Arizona has an entity of a 
U.S. state whereas a token of Ralph has an entity  "
525.52,6.96,"of a person's name. And these are some of the 
tools that we can apply in this big bag of tools  "
532.48,6.32,"that we have for NLP in order to get from this 
unstructured human speech through to something  "
538.8,5.68,"structured that a computer can understand. And 
once we've done that then we can apply that  "
544.48,6.64,"structured data to all sorts of AI applications. 
Now there's obviously a lot more to it than this  "
551.12,4.8,"and I've included some links in the description if 
you'd like to know more, but hopefully this made  "
556.48,8.48,"some sense and that you were able to process some 
of the natural language that I've shared today.  "

please drop us a line below. And if you want  "
571.84,4.0,"to see more videos like this in the 
future, please like and subscribe."
