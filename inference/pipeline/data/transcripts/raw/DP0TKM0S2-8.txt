8.88,2.879,data science and machine learning are
10.32,3.12,the two most burst words in the
11.759,2.96,industries these days
13.44,3.36,hi everyone
14.719,4.081,welcome to this video by simply loan
16.8,4.0,today we will learn about data science
18.8,3.36,versus machine learning
20.8,3.84,data science and machine learning are
22.16,3.92,used in conjunction but if you are
24.64,2.959,looking to build a career in these
26.08,3.359,domains it is important to know the
27.599,3.84,difference between them
29.439,2.8,with data getting generated at a massive
31.439,2.001,rate
32.239,2.721,data science and machine learning
33.44,3.44,technologies have become increasingly
34.96,3.84,important in the industries to draw
36.88,3.44,value out of these data and derive
38.8,3.04,insights
40.32,3.68,both data science and machine learning
41.84,4.64,complement each other but understanding
44.0,4.96,how they work is important
46.48,4.72,let's first begin by defining what is
48.96,4.16,data science
51.2,3.839,data science is a field of study that
53.12,4.32,largely deals with the use of modern
55.039,5.121,tools and techniques to process clean
57.44,4.48,analyze and visualize large data sets
60.16,3.36,the data collected by companies can be
61.92,3.92,in various formats
63.52,4.56,it could be structured semi-structured
65.84,4.16,or unstructured in nature
68.08,4.24,data science helps to get valuable
70.0,4.08,information from this data data
72.32,3.839,scientists are professionals who convert
74.08,4.079,raw data into meaningful insights find
76.159,4.081,market patterns and help organizations
78.159,3.841,to take important decisions
80.24,4.32,data science is extensively used in
82.0,4.72,companies such as amazon netflix airbnb
84.56,3.76,and ibm
86.72,2.719,let's understand what is machine
88.32,2.479,learning
89.439,3.04,machine learning is a field of
90.799,3.441,artificial intelligence that allows
92.479,4.161,machines to learn from vast volumes of
94.24,4.559,past data and make intelligent decisions
96.64,4.08,on their own using algorithms
98.799,4.64,it gives computers the ability to learn
100.72,4.56,without being explicitly programmed
103.439,3.521,machine learning helps to train models
105.28,3.119,that learn automatically and improve
106.96,4.0,with experience
108.399,4.0,companies such as google facebook apple
110.96,4.56,and philips use machine learning to
112.399,5.76,build ai systems now let's look at the
115.52,4.8,relationship between these technologies
118.159,4.64,the picture that you see on your screen
120.32,4.64,tells you that data science is a broad
122.799,4.081,domain that covers ai machine learning
124.96,3.519,as well as deep learning machine
126.88,3.439,learning is a subset of artificial
128.479,4.4,intelligence and it covers another sub
130.319,4.0,technology called deep learning
132.879,3.201,deep learning is a part of machine
134.319,3.761,learning that uses artificial neural
136.08,3.6,networks to train models
138.08,3.44,it works based on the structure and
139.68,4.24,function of a human brain
141.52,3.92,now here you can see the google trends
143.92,3.28,for data science and machine learning in
145.44,3.04,the united states over the past five
147.2,3.119,years
148.48,4.32,the graph depicts that the search
150.319,3.841,volumes are really high and both data
152.8,3.6,science and machine learning are very
154.16,4.32,much in demand these days people are
156.4,4.0,searching for these terms on google on
158.48,4.399,youtube and other platforms and want to
160.4,4.0,learn about them next
162.879,3.681,let us understand the different data
164.4,3.68,science steps the first step in data
166.56,3.92,science is to understand the business
168.08,4.72,objectives define the goals and find a
170.48,4.16,lucrative solution the next step in the
172.8,4.24,process is to collect the right data
174.64,4.4,that is relevant to the problem at hand
177.04,4.72,the data can be in various forms and
179.04,4.4,from different sources up next we have
181.76,3.52,data wrangling
183.44,4.24,this process helps to convert the raw
185.28,5.84,data into another useful format that
187.68,5.279,would be more appropriate for analytics
191.12,3.039,the fourth step in the process is data
192.959,3.121,exploration
194.159,3.521,exploratory data analysis is used to
196.08,4.159,extract valuable information from the
197.68,4.479,data and find unseen patterns
200.239,3.681,data modeling is the process of creating
202.159,3.041,intelligent models using sophisticated
203.92,3.12,algorithms
205.2,3.6,the result of the model will help
207.04,3.759,companies to solve complex problems and
208.8,4.4,make decisions
210.799,4.321,and the final step is data visualization
213.2,5.2,where data scientists visualize the data
215.12,5.92,and forecast future trends
218.4,4.16,moving on to the machine learning steps
221.04,3.68,the first step in the process is to
222.56,4.88,import the data the data that is used
224.72,5.439,for analysis can be a text file an excel
227.44,6.0,file a dot csv file or it could be
230.159,5.281,present in a github repository as well
233.44,2.96,the next step is to filter and clean the
235.44,2.4,data
236.4,3.68,the data that is used for creating
237.84,4.319,machine learning models is mostly messy
240.08,4.64,containing missing values and is not fit
242.159,5.681,for analysis hence it is important to
244.72,4.96,clean the data before use
247.84,3.52,then it is important to select the right
249.68,4.8,machine learning algorithm based on the
251.36,4.879,problem that we want to solve
254.48,3.68,in the next machine learning step you
256.239,4.56,should train your model and then test
258.16,4.08,your model with new data points
260.799,3.281,the final step is to improve the
262.24,4.0,efficiency of the model and optimize its
264.08,3.76,accuracy let us talk about the main
266.24,2.8,objective of data science and machine
267.84,3.44,learning
269.04,3.92,so data science is used to find unseen
271.28,4.0,patterns in the data and discover hidden
272.96,4.799,trends using data mining techniques data
275.28,4.4,wrangling exploratory data analysis
277.759,4.561,statistical analysis as well as data
279.68,4.56,visualization
282.32,3.52,while machine learning majorly focuses
284.24,3.36,on using machine learning algorithms to
285.84,3.12,build predictive models and forecast
287.6,3.12,future trends
288.96,4.08,it is used to classify the result of a
290.72,3.759,new data point machine learning uses
293.04,3.12,supervised unsupervised and
294.479,3.44,reinforcement learning methods to solve
296.16,2.88,problems
297.919,2.641,with that
299.04,3.36,let's move on and learn about the
300.56,3.919,popular tools used for data science and
302.4,4.079,machine learning some of the tools are
304.479,3.521,common to both data scientists and
306.479,3.681,machine learning engineers use a
308.0,3.919,combination of tools applications
310.16,3.039,principles and algorithms to make sense
311.919,3.28,of data
313.199,4.321,sas and python are widely used
315.199,4.56,programming language and data science we
317.52,4.72,also have the apache spark framework
319.759,5.361,matlab data visualization software such
322.24,4.32,as tableau and databases such as mongodb
325.12,3.04,and mysql
326.56,4.32,now talking about the tools and software
328.16,6.0,used for machine learning we have python
330.88,5.84,r scikit learn amazon lex as well as
