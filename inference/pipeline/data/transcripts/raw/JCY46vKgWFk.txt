0.24,4.44,hi my name is Olivia lanes and I'm the
2.399,3.36,North American lead here at IBM Quantum
4.68,3.239,and today we're going to be talking
5.759,4.621,about how to best increase your chances
7.919,4.64,of getting an internship at IBM Quantum
10.38,5.64,or any other Quantum Computing company
12.559,5.621,so the complaint I hear most from
16.02,3.66,applicants every season is how hard it
18.18,3.96,is to get an interview so we're going to
19.68,4.859,focus on the getting to the interview
22.14,4.32,stage of your application for
24.539,4.5,internships because once our applicants
26.46,6.36,get interviews they actually do quite
29.039,6.781,well so in order to get
32.82,4.44,your application and your resume in
35.82,3.899,front of a hiring manager I'm going to
37.26,4.619,give you some some specific tips so
39.719,4.441,first thing to know is here at IBM
41.879,4.68,Quantum we have one of the biggest
44.16,5.16,internship opportunities out of any
46.559,4.921,Quantum Computing company we host over a
49.32,3.78,hundred interns every summer and I'm
51.48,3.419,happy to say that this year we have
53.1,4.979,already launched our internship
54.899,5.761,applications for our 2023 internship
58.079,4.861,season so we have three specific
60.66,5.34,applications that I want to talk about
62.94,5.16,today we have the hardware internships
66.0,4.32,the software internships and then the
68.1,4.08,research internships and every single
70.32,3.839,category that I'm listing here has their
72.18,5.28,own job recommendation
74.159,4.981,so the hardware internships are pretty
77.46,3.24,self-explanatory if you want to work in
79.14,2.82,sort of like an engineering role get
80.7,3.54,your hands dirty with some of the
81.96,3.72,hardware that's the job for you if
84.24,4.379,you're interested in software
85.68,4.979,applications or working on any layer of
88.619,4.32,the quantum Computing stack or even
90.659,4.561,Theory the software application wreck is
92.939,4.441,for you and if you have experience doing
95.22,4.38,research if you're a graduate student
97.38,4.32,and you want to know what research is
99.6,3.839,like in a more industrial setting the
101.7,3.419,research recommendation is what you're
103.439,4.621,probably going to be looking at
105.119,5.401,so with these three applications we get
108.06,4.08,lots of applicants every single year and
110.52,3.3,it can be really really hard to know
112.14,3.9,which applicants are going to be the
113.82,5.1,best fit for every single role so here
116.04,5.16,at IBM it works like this you apply to a
118.92,4.8,specific category one of the three that
121.2,4.32,I just listed here and then your
123.72,4.2,application and your resume gets put
125.52,4.56,into a pool and hiring managers have
127.92,3.66,access to everybody in the pool and so
130.08,4.44,they're going to be looking for people
131.58,5.1,whose qualifications match specific
134.52,4.859,skills needed for the job that they're
136.68,5.94,looking to hire for that summer
139.379,5.761,so you want to make your application as
142.62,5.699,specific as possible and it's totally
145.14,4.86,okay to apply to more than one of these
148.319,3.901,positions but one thing I will caution
150.0,4.5,you on is you really need to tailor your
152.22,4.26,resume to each specific job wreck that
154.5,3.9,you're applying to so if you might be
156.48,3.66,interested in hardware and software and
158.4,3.96,you're not really sure which one would
160.14,4.56,be more fun you do need to write
162.36,3.9,different applications you need to have
164.7,3.48,a resume that lists your Hardware
166.26,3.24,experience more prominently than maybe
168.18,3.36,your software experience and then you
169.5,3.84,need to have another which really digs
171.54,3.66,into your software experience maybe over
173.34,3.72,your Hardware experience assuming you
175.2,4.74,have both one other question people have
177.06,4.74,is when should I apply to a Quantum
179.94,3.72,Computing internship a lot of people
181.8,3.42,think that they need to wait until they
183.66,3.24,are further along in their education and
185.22,3.659,maybe working towards a graduate degree
186.9,4.38,to even have a good chance of applying
188.879,4.86,but that's not actually true as you can
191.28,3.9,see from this graph here our internships
193.739,3.241,are pretty split down the middle in
195.18,3.059,terms of people that we hire who are
196.98,2.7,working towards their bachelor degree
198.239,3.901,and people that we hire who are working
199.68,6.3,towards a graduate degree and it's split
202.14,7.56,at about 48 percent undergrads about 15
205.98,7.38,percent Masters students and about 46
209.7,5.64,phds equating to about uh 36 percent
213.36,3.54,people who are working towards their
215.34,3.899,doctorate degree and this is just data
216.9,3.839,from last year so I would say apply as
219.239,3.661,soon as you are interested and as soon
220.739,3.72,as you have relevant experience towards
222.9,4.199,the job that you are looking to attain
224.459,5.821,so once people are accepted into one of
227.099,4.92,these three programs you can see here we
230.28,3.599,have a list of specific projects that
232.019,3.841,people worked on last year in software
233.879,4.321,and a specific list that people worked
235.86,3.9,on here last year in Hardware so if any
238.2,3.959,of these apply to you I definitely
239.76,4.199,encourage you to apply so as I was
242.159,4.381,saying it's really important to make
243.959,4.741,your application as specific as possible
246.54,5.1,because you're not applying to a
248.7,4.739,specific team you're applying to be as
251.64,3.959,part of a pool as part of a category and
253.439,4.381,then hiring managers have to select you
255.599,4.561,out of that pool and figure out which
257.82,4.199,skill set is best for the project that
260.16,5.4,they want you to work on you should
262.019,6.12,really be as specific as possible
265.56,4.199,so for instance one thing that I see a
268.139,3.601,lot is people who are really General
269.759,3.361,resumes and they say you know I just I
271.74,3.54,love Quantum Computing I would do
273.12,3.72,anything to work in Quantum Computing
275.28,3.96,I'm interested in all aspects of it
276.84,4.139,which is it's great to hear that but it
279.24,3.78,makes it really really hard to know what
280.979,4.141,to hire you for because we don't
283.02,4.679,actually see any specific direction or
285.12,5.28,any specific passion so we need to know
287.699,4.44,what specific aspects are most appealing
290.4,3.48,to you and sometimes I sympathize and it
292.139,3.12,can be really hard to choose there's a
293.88,3.72,lot of interesting aspects of quantum
295.259,3.901,Computing but if you can just pick one
297.6,4.319,or two and put at the top of your
299.16,5.16,application or at the top of your CV hi
301.919,4.801,I'm so and so and I am looking to apply
304.32,5.7,to a position doing X Y and Z based on
306.72,5.46,my specific experience in X Y and Z
310.02,4.02,that's going to increase your chances of
312.18,3.78,sticking out to a hiring manager and
314.04,3.719,letting them know oh this person has a
315.96,4.26,direction and they have a specific skill
317.759,4.261,which lends itself towards me and my
320.22,3.96,project another thing that I always tell
322.02,4.88,people is helpful to do is to get a
324.18,5.28,referral but I think what people sort of
326.9,4.48,misconstrue with that notion is that
329.46,4.679,they should reach out to anybody at the
331.38,5.52,company and ask for a general referral
334.139,5.4,Without Really knowing them and this is
336.9,4.32,actually not helpful because if a person
339.539,3.841,who you know works on the software side
341.22,3.6,is asked for a referral and they they
343.38,2.759,want to you know help you out and they
344.82,3.24,give you a referral but you're
346.139,3.421,interested in a hardware position that
348.06,3.18,referral doesn't really mean anything
349.56,2.82,because that person doesn't really know
351.24,3.48,the project you're going to be working
352.38,4.56,on what I would recommend doing instead
354.72,4.02,of just reaching out to people at the
356.94,3.78,company if you don't really know what
358.74,4.32,they work on is to find specific people
360.72,5.28,who are working in an area that you're
363.06,6.06,interested in and say hi you know my
366.0,5.46,name is ABC I am really interested in
369.12,3.84,the work that you've done be specific
371.46,3.9,tell them the work that they've done
372.96,4.56,that you're interested in and say you
375.36,3.899,know I have a specific skill do you
377.52,4.019,think there's a fit for me on your team
379.259,5.581,this year don't just come out and ask
381.539,5.1,for a referral I would say am I am I a
384.84,4.68,good fit for you do I have relevant
386.639,4.921,skills do you have any openings on your
389.52,4.08,team this year this is all going to lend
391.56,3.419,itself much more organically to helping
393.6,3.48,you get your foot in the door all right
394.979,4.381,so lastly I want to list some really
397.08,4.32,specific things that hiring managers
399.36,4.32,have told me that they have been looking
401.4,4.98,for in the past so you can know the
403.68,4.68,level of detail that you should be
406.38,4.439,looking to put on your CV now don't
408.36,4.619,write these sentences down exactly these
410.819,4.561,are just examples of things that people
412.979,5.101,were looking for last year so you can
415.38,3.72,know how people are going to be viewing
418.08,3.42,your resume
419.1,3.96,so for instance a hardware manager told
421.5,4.86,me that they are looking for people who
423.06,5.579,have specific e m RF and microwave
426.36,5.04,experience along with basic or even
428.639,4.441,quantum mechanics experience
431.4,4.019,they also need to have hands-on
433.08,4.679,experience with connectors power and
435.419,4.081,mechanical design and it's also
437.759,4.321,desirable to have software development
439.5,5.099,skills for automation purposes
442.08,4.2,on the other hand a software hiring
444.599,4.141,manager told me that you know we hire
446.28,4.919,people all along the stack of quantum
448.74,4.5,Computing software so the specific
451.199,3.601,languages that they might be looking for
453.24,3.359,you to have experience in really depend
454.8,3.899,on what part of the stack you want to
456.599,3.361,look at look at and work on either at
458.699,3.241,the front end the back end part of
459.96,4.079,development but some of the languages
461.94,4.259,that we look for specifically
464.039,3.481,this is not all inclusive but as an
466.199,3.421,example
467.52,5.82,um are people who have experience with
469.62,7.139,languages like C rust Pi torch SQL
473.34,5.759,pandas and kiske in addition software
476.759,3.901,development hiring managers look for you
479.099,3.901,to be able to demonstrate that you care
480.66,4.8,about clean code principles and are able
483.0,4.86,to work on technical projects in a
485.46,3.78,really collaborative team environment
487.86,3.6,so those are the tips that I have for
489.24,4.56,you right now I hope that some of these
491.46,4.139,have helped you gleam what might help
493.8,3.899,you get your foot in the door and secure
495.599,3.901,an internship for next summer if you
497.699,4.5,have any other questions feel free to
499.5,4.919,ask them in the comments below and good
502.199,4.261,luck with the 2023 internship hiring
504.419,5.041,season
506.46,3.0,everybody
