in any business anticipating and
planning for what's next
is crucial for success and when caring
for someone's health
predicting what's ahead has the
potential to save lives
that's why we've launched catalyst.ai
and healthcare.ai
an initiative that will make machine
learning and predictive analytics
widely available across all of
healthcare
today we've observed that only the
largest health systems have the
resources to build
staff and play in the predictive
analytics sandbox
and with such demand for data scientists
having the right people on board is
either cost
prohibitive unsustainable or impossible
at health catalyst we believe these
life-saving technologies
should be made available everywhere
that's why we developed
catalyst.ai with catalyst.ai
machine learning models are designed and
built into each product we deliver
so caregivers can now easily make
predictive analytics
routine and actionable imagine how
valuable
access to data-driven machine learning
could be for a caregiver like dr
martinez
utilizing machine learning dr martinez
can uncover
patterns in her own patient data she and
her colleagues could identify the best
interventions
to reduce a patient's length of stay
avert the next readmission
or the next deadly infection all based
on a patient's
specific risk factors she could even
prevent the next onset of diabetes
we also want to make these benefits
available to anyone in healthcare
not just our customers so we took our
technology
and learning and created healthcare.ai
the industry's first collaborative open
source repository of machine learning
software and expertise
by making an easy to use software
package that automates key machine
learning tasks
we've made machine learning accessible
and democratized
without requiring advanced technical
skills to get started
healthcare.ai also allows data
professionals who know healthcare data
but who may not be deeply experienced in
machine learning
to uncover hidden insights by quickly
creating
and deploying complex models and because
healthcare.ai
is a community resource for learning
weekly broadcasts
and interactive collaboration access to
machine learning and healthcare
is now available for everyone just like
dr martinez
at health catalyst we know outcomes and
we know how data is used to drive
outcomes improvement
with catalyst.ai we bring machine
learning
into all of our products products that
are used to drive better outcomes for
our customers
with healthcare ai we've brought machine
learning tools to
everyone to lower the barriers of entry
for using predictive analytics to
accelerate outcomes improvement
industry-wide together catalyst.ai
and healthcare.ai represent the next
generation of healthcare analytics
because in today's value-based world
relying on historical data
simply isn't good enough caregivers like
dr martinez
can utilize these tools to map a patient
care plan
that accounts for not only what risks
lay directly ahead
but also for those lurking just around
the corner
