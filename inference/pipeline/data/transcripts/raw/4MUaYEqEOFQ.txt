0.08,3.359,in today's world we are able to
1.839,4.48,communicate with our phone through
3.439,5.12,google assistant gadgets like alexa and
6.319,4.721,siri helping us with paying bills
8.559,4.96,weather updates and much more it's all
11.04,4.88,possible because of natural language
13.519,4.881,processing in artificial intelligence a
15.92,5.6,human can hardly talk in two to three
18.4,5.44,languages but a robot can talk in almost
21.52,4.56,all languages with natural language
23.84,4.72,processing we are able to translate text
26.08,4.88,from english to hindi chinese to tamil
28.56,4.4,and much more today we are communicating
30.96,4.4,with our smart tv through voice
32.96,5.36,recognition natural language processing
35.36,5.44,in the 21st century nlp or natural
38.32,4.8,language processing becomes the heart of
40.8,4.16,artificial intelligence in this video we
43.12,3.759,are going to learn what is natural
44.96,4.16,language processing in artificial
46.879,5.041,intelligence and its importance welcome
49.12,7.04,to ai english i am krishna tinia mandela
51.92,6.56,firstly let's start with what is nlp nlp
56.16,5.44,or natural language processing is a
58.48,5.679,process of mimicking and interpreting
61.6,5.28,our natural spoken conversations by
64.159,6.0,machines and robots before we start our
66.88,5.76,concept once watch this video hi i'm
70.159,4.081,nadine what is your name
72.64,4.24,hello nadine
74.24,3.44,my name is edgar it's a pleasure to meet
76.88,3.919,you
77.68,6.16,you look nice where are you from
80.799,6.241,thank you you look nice too i was born
83.84,5.2,in japan but i grew up in ionia i am is
87.04,3.2,the institute for media innovation in
89.04,2.96,ntu
90.24,2.64,what about you
92.0,3.92,oh
92.88,6.48,i also grew up in imi but i was born in
95.92,6.32,singapore here in ntu so why have i not
99.36,5.84,seen you before in this video two ai
102.24,5.44,robots talking to each other but robots
105.2,4.8,are not humans and they don't have brain
107.68,4.88,then how come these robots able to
110.0,5.36,understand language let's find out now
112.56,5.519,natural language processing is a subset
115.36,5.759,of artificial intelligence to understand
118.079,5.841,a language nlp uses machine learning
121.119,5.121,algorithms to detect the patterns of
123.92,5.36,voice recognition and grammar in
126.24,5.999,sentences as ai system has already
129.28,6.08,stored huge amount of language data in
132.239,5.681,their database ai robots or machines
135.36,4.8,starts recognizing the voice commands
137.92,4.8,and understand the meaning from their
140.16,4.4,natural language processing library now
142.72,4.56,in reply to the question machine
144.56,5.44,learning algorithms acts as a brain and
147.28,5.2,gives answers by detecting patterns in
150.0,4.959,the voice mood etc today with
152.48,5.2,advancement in computing memory and
154.959,5.441,super fast processing voice assistants
157.68,5.12,able to give quicker replay in seconds
160.4,4.88,so let's see some of our real life
162.8,4.96,natural language processing examples
165.28,5.039,number one in gmail our males are
167.76,6.16,classified into different categories
170.319,6.0,like primary social spam and promotions
173.92,4.8,this is possible due to a type in
176.319,4.961,natural language processing called text
178.72,5.599,classification it is also called as spam
181.28,6.239,filter number two in apps like flipkart
184.319,6.0,zomato amazon and google the customer
187.519,5.44,support initially we used to communicate
190.319,5.28,with a chart board with natural language
192.959,5.761,processing artificial intelligence if an
195.599,5.681,nlp bot unable to solve our problem it
198.72,4.96,connects to a customer care agent number
201.28,5.36,three whatever you type in google the
203.68,5.36,search results in google page displayed
206.64,5.28,happen with natural language processing
209.04,5.759,it is with text recognition number four
211.92,5.679,in our keyboard if you type how are the
214.799,4.961,next words suggest as you the automatic
217.599,4.241,prediction in your smartphone keyboard
219.76,4.24,works with artificial intelligence
221.84,4.72,natural language processing number six
224.0,5.12,in youtube videos automatic generated
226.56,4.64,subtitles works with natural language
229.12,4.319,processing speech recognition this
231.2,5.2,technique is also called as speech to
233.439,5.52,text number seven last but not the least
236.4,5.36,all language translators are the best
238.959,5.521,examples of natural language processing
241.76,4.96,but why natural language processing is
244.48,4.56,required as the amount of data on the
246.72,4.96,internet increasing day by day it is
249.04,4.72,important for individuals and companies
251.68,4.88,to understand the information in a
253.76,5.68,simple and faster way for example there
256.56,5.199,is a 5000 words comment in our youtube
259.44,4.88,channel or in a google play store game
261.759,5.041,review with natural language processing
264.32,4.4,algorithm it can detect the sentiment of
266.8,4.16,the review whether it's a positive
268.72,5.12,review or a negative review from last
270.96,5.44,few years why search in google increases
273.84,4.56,by 200 percent we need to thank natural
276.4,3.76,language processing in artificial
278.4,3.84,intelligence for making our search
280.16,4.88,results easier now coming to the future
282.24,5.2,of natural language processing in ai in
285.04,4.879,future customer problems can be solved
287.44,5.039,within minutes one of the best example
289.919,4.881,royal bank of scotland uses text
292.479,4.801,analytics of their customer feedback
294.8,4.88,form to understand their dissatisfaction
297.28,5.359,and implemented improvements in future
299.68,5.04,the documentation of a liar work can be
302.639,4.0,automized with natural language
304.72,4.319,processing and one more example
306.639,5.28,completely robots operated hotel in
309.039,5.121,china the henna hotel works with natural
311.919,4.321,language processing most of the hotels
314.16,4.08,brings robots and hide them as
316.24,4.64,receptionist in the future in the
318.24,5.28,healthcare industry a patient illness
320.88,7.2,can be detected using speech patterns
323.52,7.36,with nlp by 2026 it is expected that nlp
328.08,5.6,market would grow at 20 percent rate and
330.88,4.4,reach 35 billion dollar market if you
