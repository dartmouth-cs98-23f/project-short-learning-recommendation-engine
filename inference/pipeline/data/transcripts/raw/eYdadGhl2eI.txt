3.96,5.24,"We live in a world where digital technologies are integrated
 in most aspects of our lives."
9.4,3.36,"We actively use smartphones
 both at work and at home."
13.24,3.32,"We use smartwatches
 for fitness and health."
17.12,4.92,"We use interactive office equipment
 for collaboration and many more things."
22.32,2.28,My colleagues will give concrete examples -
24.6,2.68,"on concepts and prototypes
 that we currently work on."
30.72,3.24,"Virtual and augmented reality have become
 quite popular for entertainment."
34.56,3.16,"But before these become useful tools
 in our everyday lives,"
37.72,2.36,"there are still several hard problems
 for us to solve."
40.8,2.6,"So we are designing novel 3D
 interaction techniques"
43.56,3.96,"and user interfaces that are ergonomic
 and adjusted to the actual task."
48.0,2.56,"We also explore new approaches
 for object tracking -"
50.96,4.72,"collaboration in virtual environments and interaction
 with robots through augmented reality."
56.12,1.92,Immersive technologies can thereby help us
58.04,2.68,"acquire new knowledge and to work
 more productively."
64.32,3.88,"In the future our computer interfaces
 will be able to dynamically change between"
68.2,0.96,different shapes.
70.04,5.12,"Envision a world where flexible displays
 are seamlessly blended into rooms and their furniture"
75.68,1.84,where users can change and adapt
77.52,3.24,"their physical work environment
 as they shift between activities."
82.12,3.8,"We are exploring this future
 by developing shape changing tabletops -"
85.92,2.08,that fold into different configurations
88.8,3.24,"while users are collaborating
 and sharing information."
94.92,4.8,"Under the hood, all the devices in our environment
 generate a vast amount of data."
99.96,2.52,"To make this data useful, to society"
102.84,4.16,"our research combines methods from machine
 learning and artificial intelligence"
107.2,2.16,with interactive data visualization.
110.2,4.0,"An outcome of this research
 are fundamental contributions"
114.2,4.4,"to the area of big data analytics
 through progressive computation."
119.48,4.88,"But we also use that research
 in real world scenarios, for example,"
124.36,3.96,"for looking at how living patterns
 have changed during"
128.32,4.04,"the COVID 19 pandemic
 through the lens of sensor data."
137.0,3.04,"As digital technologies
 increasingly become part of our everyday lives -"
140.24,2.24,"there's a need for everyone
 to understand how they work"
142.88,2.64,"and what are the implications for the way
 we live."
145.72,4.04,"To foster such understanding, we conduct research
 on educational learning tools."
150.12,2.28,"Letting children experiment
 with these tools -"
152.4,1.76,"they can learn, for instance,
 about the importance"
154.16,1.96,"of training data in machine learning,"
156.12,3.56,"and how that data quality
 and quantity influence the results."
160.08,2.52,We are a diverse research team
162.84,3.88,"brought together with the desire
 to actively shape the digital future."
167.0,5.32,"We do this through our research, teaching
 and the user-centered design approach."
172.88,3.64,"And you are of course very welcome
 to reach out to us to learn more."
