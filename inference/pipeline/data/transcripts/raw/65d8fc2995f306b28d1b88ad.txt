hello everyone thank you for joining us
for today for our live session on
predictive modeling through spatial
analysis and data science this session
is part of our national government
webinar series my name is noelle lochren
and i am a marketing specialist on
esri's national government industry
solutions team
and i would like to let you know that
today's session is being recorded all of
you will receive an email with a link to
the recording tomorrow from go to
webinar
we will be answering any questions you
may have during today's session please
use the chat window and go to webinar to
enter in any of the questions you have
and once we're done with the
presentation we'll get to those one by
one
we will also be providing two polling
questions during today's session those
are interactive and you can click on the
answers on the screen so we will have
those pop up as we ask those questions
and from there i'd also like to
introduce our speakers to you so we have
three um experts from esri here with us
today we have kate hess she is a
solution engineer for the geospatial
authorities team here at esri we also
have rami who is a solution engineer
also for the geospatial authorities team
and linda peters who is our global
business development manager
here at esri so with that i'd like to
pass this over to linda and she can get
us started with the agenda thank you
thanks so much noelle and uh welcome
everybody really glad you're here uh i'm
gonna shut camera off for bandwidth
considerations but i'll come back to you
at the end when we get to the q a
portion
um i would like to go over with you
today's agenda
so we are here to talk about spatial
analysis and data science um there's
going to be a lot of good demonstrations
for you today but we're going to start
out with a little context on data
science and gis
and then i'll invite kate and romney to
show you those great examples
as no noelle mentioned we'll have a
couple of poll questions along the way
we're going to share a lot of resources
with you and at the end open it up for
questions so we hope you're ready for us
um let's start as
i always tend to with the arcgis system
because although we're here to talk
about spatial analysis and data science
it starts with the arcgis platform
many of you know that arcgis is a
comprehensive platform it's open it's
services based
it's distributable it's extendable and
it supports
large organizations and also individuals
and it really provides us with a smarter
way to perform analysis
so as we think about spatial analysis
and data science
these are at the heart of what most gis
professionals do
it's about solving problems and
advancing science
this year here at esri we've added a lot
of new tools and improved existing ones
we introduced many
new algorithms new tools for ai and
machine learning and big data and
scripting and some great tools for data
engineering i want to underscore those
there are some really great new tools
for data engineering as well as
forecasting including a method to allow
you to evaluate forecast by location and
choose the right method whether that's
curve fit or exponential smoothing or
random force based on your data
and we we did already a great webinar on
that so if you're interested in that
take a look at our webinar series and
take a look at those tools but today
we're here
to talk about some other areas and the
innovations and advances in gis
analytics are allowing us to really see
some of these new patterns and create
insights with predictive modeling and
analyzing of spatial temporal
information
the ability to enrich our data with glai
and machine learning is just incredible
and the ability to perform advanced
raster analytics as well and we're going
to touch on a lot of these areas as we
get into our demonstrations
i want to remind you to think about
always the spatial analysis and data
science framework as well
we need to think about our approach
my colleague lauren bennett likes to say
you know we don't just do data science
we start with a problem we identify the
people that we need to work with we find
and prepare the data visualize explore
and analyze that data and then use the
chosen method to help us get to an
answer
this could be by a clustering for
example or classification or or a
regression analysis and the reason that
we do this
again is to understand perhaps what has
happened
what could happen or what we should do
we use it to solve real world problems
to answer questions and that could be
descriptive predictive or prescriptive
so we see this very clearly over the
last 18 months i think with the use of
of dashboards helping us to understand
describe and predict what was happening
with cobit as it spread around the globe
now i don't want to spend too much
talking again we've got some great
demonstrations for us we've got some
great things to share we're going to
touch on deep learning training data
population estimation network analysis
hydro analysis dems cost service
analysis
a lot as you can tell
so with that i want to
ask my colleague kate to get ready with
that first demonstration but noelle can
i throw it over to you for a first poll
question
yes and let me launch that
so this is a question where you can
select all the answers that apply and
we're interested in understanding what
area would you be most interested in
learning more about in spatial analysis
and data science we'll keep this open
for a little bit so all of you can enter
in your responses and then we will share
them with all of you when we're done
yeah there's there's so much that's
important here again we want to
understand you know what's most
important to you we heard a lot about
data engineering earlier this year
but really want to understand where are
you at in your process today what's
important to you
i'm going to go ahead and close this now
and share those results thanks for
responding
and wow linda it looks like a lot of
people here are interested in learning
about the spatial analysis modeling and
scripting so that's that's promising
yeah
all right i will go ahead and send this
back over to our presenters thank
you yeah okay over to you
great thanks
so today in our demos we're going to be
looking at the general theme of access
and how we can calculate it with
different levels of data availability
i'll start with a high data scenario in
new york city where we have fine-grained
population data
in this case through the business
analyst tools
and detailed network data from arcgis
street map premium
after that we'll look at vaccine site
access in uganda using the distance
accumulation tool and esri's population
estimate data
and then finally we'll start from
imagery over a rohingya refugee camp and
use deep learning to extract tents then
calculate access to washrooms and see
which tents are at risk of flooding
so first let's look at new york city and
access to green space
i have a point layer here with all the
entrances to parks in the city
going to take the detailed network data
set that's available for new york city
and bring it into our network analysis
tools
within these tools
we have a few different workflow options
so we could find the closest park to a
specific building
we could do route optimization
or we could pick the best place
to locate a park based on the target
demographics in the surrounding area
but today we're going to do a service
area analysis
to find out which areas and then how
many people are served by each park in
new york city
in order to calculate a service area
once it loads in here
all i'll need to do
is add my facilities so in this case
the park entrances
and then select my mode we have a few
different options to choose from here
so there's the normal driving time and
driving distance
there's a different setting for
emergency vehicles and then other
options for rural driving distance or
trucking driving distance where it's
going to take into account different
features of the road segments
but today we're going to take a look at
walking time
and see
how men hollow which areas are within a
5 and 10 minute walk towards a park in
new york city
this tool also has the option to specify
a specific date and time or day of the
week
as you can see the data that we have for
new york city
includes live traffic data as well as
historic traffic data so we could take a
look at how the conditions differ if i'm
trying to get to a park on a weekend or
maybe in the middle of a weekday
but today we'll just keep it more
generic
when i run this tool
i get an output
showing all of the five-minute service
areas
that are
areas where i can walk from within five
minutes to any point in these polygons
and get to the park entrance
if i zoom in i can see how this is using
the network data set
for example here
the
access polygon is
is not a perfect circle
it's going to be shaped specifically
around the different
roads that people have access to to walk
towards the green space
now that we have the areas that are
within a five minute walk of green space
the next
step of our analysis will be to find out
who lives in these access areas
now because there are some overlaps
where people are within walking distance
of two parks and we don't want to double
count them
i've already run the dissolve tool so
that we have just one layer covering all
of the five minute walk areas
in order to add population data to our
five minute walk time service areas
we're going to use the enrich tool
so i can see for this geographic area we
have access to lots of different options
for demographic variables
i could explore these by category or i
could search across all of the variables
so we're interested in population
we have data available here from
different sources
so i'll take the 2020 population
estimate from esri
and then
i'll take a u.s census data set on the
number of households
we could also look at information
on the uh how equitable access is so i
could look at households above and below
the poverty level to compare how many of
them how many people in each category
live within a five minute access to a
park
once i've selected my variables i can
run this tool
and it's going to add that data directly
to our enriched polygon or directly to
our dissolved polygon layer
so now i can see that for all of the
areas
falling within these polygons
there are four million two hundred and
sixty six thousand people who live
within a five minute walk of green space
in new york city
and we could continue with that analysis
further to compare the demographics of
those living closer to a park to those
who live without easy access to green
space
another way to visualize this data is to
use census block groups which we can
download from the living atlas
here i have sized each point by their
block group population and then colored
them with the walk time data
so anything in light green is going to
be within a five minute walk of a park
dark green is within 10 minutes and red
is further than a 10 minute walk away
so now we can see at a glance the air
where there are areas of large
populations without access to green
space
i can publish this map and share it with
decision makers
using the power of gis and spatial
analysis to identify a pattern and then
bring attention to a problem
[Music]
now this use case in new york has been
an example where i have all of the data
that i need easily accessible
we had accurate population data all the
way down to the block group level and
that detailed network layer that
included details like traffic patterns
by time and day
but in many cases this level of data is
not available
luckily with a different set of spatial
analysis tools we can still calculate
access and make maps to drive decision
making
for our next analysis question we want
to see how many people are being served
by the current vaccine distribution
sites located in the gulu district of
uganda
before we get into our analysis we need
to check the data availability to
determine the best methods for our
analysis
we can check demographic global
data coverage and we can see based on
the legend that there's some data
available for 2019
but when i select uganda i can see that
this only goes down to the district
level geography so this isn't going to
be enough when we're trying to look at
access within one specific district to
these different vaccine sites
we can also look at the street map
premium coverage
in this publicly available map
and we can see that for uganda we're
only going to have major roads available
unlike the highly local roads we had in
new york city
so even with this amount of data we can
still quantify vaccine accessibility in
the gulu route in the gulu region of
uganda
we're going to use
the highways that we already have
combine that with slope data
land cover and rivers
and perform spatial analysis on these
geographic features in order to
calculate access
and our ultimate goal here is to
identify which areas and then how many
people are within a one hour walk from
the vaccine sites
to more accurately calculate the
distance walkable in an hour we're going
to create a cost raster
so this raster will have a value for
each cell indicating the cost or
essentially the difficulty of traveling
through it
to create this raster we're going to
take the four layers that we already
have as our source data sets the
highways land cover rivers and slope
and then we're going to reclassify them
on a scale of 1 to 10
where 1 is the lowest cost to traverse
and 10 is the highest or
hardest
so in my reclassified rasters
you can see that we've simplified this
data
now i can see that the southern sections
of the district that are mostly cropland
are going to be easier to walk through
than the northern areas that are
primarily forested
you can see in the legend that we've
also set rivers as the hardest to
traverse and highways as the easiest
now that i have my four reclassified
inputs we can run the weighted sum tool
to combine the weights giving us one
value for how difficult it is to cross
each cell
and in that cost raster
we can now start to visualize which
sites will be easier to travel to in
green
[Music]
to take this further and to get a
walkable area for each vaccine site we
will input our cost raster into the
distance accumulation tool
now for this tool
we're going to use all of the data that
we've put together so far
so our
sort our feature of interest is the
vaccine sites
the barrier is going to be the rivers
our surface raster will be the elevation
and this elevation raster is what's
going to be used to calculate the actual
surface distance that's been covered
when people are traveling through these
cells on their way to the vaccine sites
the cost raster is made up of all the
different factors that we just talked
about
and finally i just need to indicate that
the maximum
the maximum accumulation or the total
distance we're going to travel
is not going to exceed one hour and then
we're traveling toward the vaccine sites
now when i run this distance
accumulation tool
i get an output that looks pretty
similar to the output layers we had
from the service areas analysis in new
york city
and we can immediately see that the
areas accessible in the green parts of
the map are larger than those in the
yellow parts of the map
which is as we expected from our initial
look at the data
now we want to know how many people are
being served by these vaccine sites
but we don't have the detailed
demographic data like we did for new
york
in cases like this
we can use additional data sets
like esri's world population estimate
layer
which we can access
from the living atlas
this data set was created with a model
that combines imagery road intersection
density populated places and urban
footprints to create a raster of
population with a cell size of about 250
meters
the population then of each polygon
within a country was normalized to the
un's population estimates for each
country to further ensure its accuracy
when we load in this data we can start
to see how it will line up with our
vaccine access sites and further explore
it
so we're expecting the most uh the
highest population to be in the city of
gulu
in the middle and if i select a cell in
the middle of the city
we can see that about 280 people live
within or nearby this 250 meter cell
then i can compare that to somewhere
further from the city
and see that just 112 people are living
in this cell
further from the main city
now to get a more accurate count
of the number of people served within
each
access area we can use the zonal
statistics tool
so for this tool all we have to input
is our featured data
so the world population data
or in this case that will be our one
hour walk accessibility
then we'll look at the population
estimate and the output will show
the sum of all of the population
of all the population cells that fall
within that polygon of walk
accessibility
so when i run this tool
we get an output
where i've colored each of these
different
service areas by the number of people
that they serve
and we can immediately see that three of
the different
vaccine sites
are not going to be within an hour
walking distance for any of the citizens
of this area
and this is at least based on the esri
population estimates but these are sites
that we may want to consider relocating
so that we can better serve the gulu
population
with this analysis we were able to
answer our question of how many people
are being served by the vaccine sites in
gulu without a sophisticated network
data set or high resolution population
data
this is the power of the spatial
analysis tools
they allow us to solve problems with
different levels of input data
now to further illustrate this i'm going
to pass it over to rami to do an
accessibility analysis for a refugee
thank you camp
hello everyone thank you for being here
today
so
through our presentation today we're
going to go through
another
workflow of spatial analysis that we're
going to study
the rohingya refugee camp
and to start with we wanted to focus on
sdg6 which is ensuring availability and
sustainable management of water
under this sdg there are six eight
different targets and we're going to be
touching these targets through our
analysis
to start with our analysis we had to
pick up our study area and for that we
focused on the cox bizarre region which
is on the borders of myanmar in
bangladesh
and if we zoom in
this regions host something around 1
million refugees
and we wanted to focus on a small area
for the availability of data
and to ensure that we're getting the
best out of the tools
so as we go forward we had to ask couple
of questions for our analysis what
percent of populations live in the most
critical areas of flooding how many
washrooms and latvines are located
within these the most critical
areas of flooding and what percent of
refugee camp
do not have access to a washroom within
a 2.5 minute walk time
to answer question 1
we were able to find that 27 percent of
the population
actually lives in flooding area which is
a really high number for refugees
and there and from within this area
there's around 100 latrines and 45
washrooms that are in critical flooding
risk
what we're seeing on the screen is the
dashboard that is showing the end
results and we're going to be going
through the process on how we got here
but start with the dashboard is telling
us where are these
washrooms where are they sitting in the
highest flood areas
and then it's telling us how many people
are sitting within these tents
moreover
if we go to question three there's 24 of
the population that actually lives
in more than 2.5 minutes walk time to
get into a washroom which is alone a big
thing
the dashboard we're seeing on the screen
is actually telling us
where are these tents who got access and
who doesn't and who's living within a
walking distance
in our study area there's an estimate of
32 000 people living there and we can
see that 11 900 of them doesn't really
have access to washrooms
so to start our analysis our first
challenge was to find data reasonable
data for refugee areas and for that we
wanted to utilize the power of deep
learning within arcgis pro
we were able to get hands on publicly
available drone imagery by iom or
international organization of migration
what you're seeing on the screen is a
sample of this drone energy imagery and
what you're seeing in blue is the first
one of the deep learning model
we use an out of the box deep learning
model that is available in living atlas
for africa and since this model was
trained in africa we weren't expecting
to get the best results and you can see
that in the screen
the model is actually detecting couple
of buildings but it's not giving me the
full story of foreign it's missing tons
of
tents and i want that
so enabled in order to accomplish that
we had to
retrain the model and to retrain the
model we had to digitize all of this
area which is approximately three
thousand refugee tents
it took us a while to digitize this and
then we used the export training data
for deep learning in arcgis pro which
you can see on the screen
through a certain metadata format we
were able to export these chips that are
labeled with the data we want
moving forward we trained our model
through train deep learning models in
arcgis pro we imported we inputted the
training data that we exported and we
ran the model it took around 20 hours to
retrain the model
and the actual reported accuracy is
something around 85
which means that from the images that
we've got the model will get something
around 85 percent of the buildings
moving forward we had to test the model
and we're going to start with the first
initial view
the model from africa and this is a
complete different area so as we're
seeing here yes the model isn't giving
the best results but what happens after
we try our model
is pretty fascinating we're able to
locate these stents attempt by tent and
get pretty accurate results so if i zoom
in to take a closer look i'm gonna see
that the intense footprints are there
and they're pretty accurate
we're seeing that the the edges aren't
smooth and this is because this is the
row output of the model
and further analysis will be able to qa
qc this data and make use of it
as we move forward in our process
we wanted to label these steps so the
first step was actually regularizing the
tense so we can see these edges smooth
and looking nice and having a good
footprint the second was how can we
classify these distance how can we get
what tent is used for
for that also i am sure the camp
facilities layer
in this flare there's different uses the
points you see on the screen and they
vary across washrooms latrines water
tanks masks etc
we use the spatial join tool
with our tents in order to get the use
of each tent
so at this point each stand each
footprint that we extracted got a use
we labeled everything and we got the
refugee tents so everything in red is
actually a tent that is occupied by
people living in it and everything else
is services and facilities
we zoom in and take closer look the
tents look good and what we are mostly
interested in for the analysis today is
the blue ones which are latvines
washrooms and toilets
and the red ones which are refugee tents
as we move forward in our analysis we
wanted to get an estimate of the
population and this was a little bit of
a tricky part
but gathering some data we were able to
locate that unhcr estimates that in the
rohingya camps there's approximately one
person living in every eight square
meter
and we got the areas of the tents we got
the dance classified that helped us with
a little bit of python we utilized the
search cursors and update cursors
function we were able to estimate how
many people are living within each tenth
so in our area of interest there's
approximately 32 000 people and they're
divided across these users
as we move forward we also mentioned the
washrooms and we wanted to know the
washroom capacity another unhcr kpi says
that each set each six square meters of
a washroom
usually can accommodate for
approximately seven households per day
and an average household and
the rohingya camps is approximately six
people
so doing the math over the population
and utilizing python again we were able
to get how many
households we can accommodate for and
that's around three point four
thousand and how many households we've
got which is six point nine thousands
and that's the first triggering thing
there's a lot more households than the
washrooms in such an area which means
that the people aren't really being
served enough for the refugees
moving forward in this analysis after we
located the things we're looking for the
dance uses that we're looking for we
wanted to go
further and understand
who is at risk and to answer these we
started with our flood risk analysis
in the flood risk analysis we were able
to find these contour lines on hdx human
data exchange hub
which has a high resolution contour
lines that's approximately one meter
we were able from these contour lines to
drive the digital elevation model you're
seeing here which i bet a lot of you who
do special analysis are pretty familiar
with digital models
after we got the digital elevation model
for our area we were able to utilize one
of the learned lessons that is available
for you
to help us predict floods with with unit
hydrographs
walking through this analysis we were
able to create the
watershed that we're seeing here with
the flood areas and locate the high risk
flood areas and these are in the blue
the tanks that overlay them are those
stands that are at risk
i'll jump to arcgis pro and show you
what's been done here briefly so we've
created our watershed through pro
and then we got the tents that are
intersecting our highest risk
we have
all the tents in the flood zone but
we're more interested in the ones that
are at high risk which are these and
then from these we filtered the refugee
tents and the washrooms so if i take a
closer look at this
i'll be able to see that yes these are
all at risk and i do have estimate of
population of these that are at risk
which we saw in the first dashboard to
do this we've actually utilized model
builder
and it's a one click that helped us
automate the whole process
i'll jump back to my story map to keep
going
the next step was to create a network
analysis or a network data set in order
to figure out from these stands who got
access who is within the proximity and
who's known
we to create the network data set we
utilized osm data that is available for
the rohingya camps and we use this model
builder which goes through the process
of filtering the roads within our area
of interest creating the network data
set and giving us a final network data
set
this network data set got two main
components which are the walking time
that's a
kpi also derived from the sphere minimum
standards and indicators for
humanitarian response
which says 83 like in a refugee area and
a walkable area you can do around 83
meters walking per minute and we
embedded that into our
network data set in our costs the next
thing that we did is we actually made
sure that the dem is in the network
analysis or the network data set because
the area is a slopey area and the
variation of slope might
get people to the place in a longer time
the next step was we wanted to test our
network anal network data set make sure
that it's giving us good service areas
and that's what we're seeing on this
screen dropping a point seeing how far
is the distance seeing if it's getting
the meat the distance doesn't really
write numbers and so on
after getting that we had to plug this
network analysis to our row input data
for the
refugee tanks that we created and the
washrooms we specified the 2.5 minutes
matrix and then we used the location
allocation tool this is a very
complicated looks like model but the end
result of that model looks
interesting because we're able to flag
these tents
and we're able to see that anything in
red is more than 2.5 minutes anything in
orange is at risk 1 to 2.5 minutes and
anything in green is well served so as
we can see all these
red tents aren't actually being served
they don't have accessible washrooms and
that will create a huge issue for the
people living
within these areas
that's it for me and thank you i'll give
it back to linda
yeah thanks ronnie that was really great
and i know there's a lot there to uh to
unpack um i think noelle why don't we uh
do our next uh poll question if you
would
yeah
so we are now asking you to choose one
of the following and we are interested
in understanding if you are using data
science methods or spatial analysis in
your organization today we'll keep this
up for a few moments so everyone has
time to
to reply
yeah we saw so many
great things there with the the the work
between kate and ramy and different
methods and different levels of uh
granularity of data that's available i
think this area of data science is just
exploding and it's really exciting to
see the work that you all are doing as
well so again we just want to understand
where you are in the process and how we
can help
and with that we will go ahead and close
the poll
share the results
and
a majority of our audience today says
that you have been using it for more
than 12 months
so that's fantastic to hear so there was
there's a lot of yeses in this session
today
good a lot of advanced users
great
well thanks again for that noelle um
i'm gonna
move us forward i want to make sure you
can see my screen okay
so i want to just sum things up a bit
for us because we don't see your screen
yet linda sorry for nothing that's all
right
that's why i was double checking there
we go perfect we can see it good good so
i wanted to uh
sort of sum things up i mean we saw a
lot of different types of analysis in
there and this is important for us as
you know we're working in our
organizations today um and and
everybody's being asked to to do more
and to deliver information much more
quickly and and everybody wants better
resolution and higher quality data
and so that's our challenge and how do
we do that um you know and and uh
maybe we're doing that with less people
in our organization or less time as
we're being asked to do more and more
hopefully what you saw here is how some
of these tools can really help you
become more responsive and speed
information to those decision makers
by using this technology and uh you know
data analysis and data science um you're
able to do uh much more and uh increase
your efficiency and expand your capacity
right being able to do an analysis like
we just saw in rohingya
you know now that we've done that how
can we
share that information to the decision
makers you know and and help engage
um at the community level and make an
impact so with that i do want to
leave you with a lot of resources and
again this is being recorded today we
will share the recording we will share
the slides we will share all of these
great links
lots of things out there for you to get
your hands on
including a great uh
story map you know the refugee tent deep
learning package which is out there now
as well
and some of the other things that you
see on the screen and of course i want
to point out our learn lessons as well a
lot of great stuff and learn as as
romney had highlighted
so with that noel i think we want to
throw it open for a q a session so i'll
throw it over to you
great thank you and i'm going to turn my
camera back on now
so first question is for kate so what
our audience is interested in knowing is
if esri if the esri network route only
only a lot does the esri network route
only along segments that have sidewalks
there we go i can read now
so the
the network that i was using was the
built-in arcgis online option
so
that one does not
put an emphasis on sidewalks but the
power of the network analysis data set
or the network analysis tools
is that you can also bring your own
network data sets to them so if you had
a sidewalk network you could load that
in and do the analysis on your specific
sidewalk layer or if you had your own
road network maybe for a country where
the arcgis online
data isn't available you can bring in
your own data to run the same kinds of
analysis on it
no well i think you're muted
that's embarrassing
okay
i need to give it a minute
there we go okay sorry about that so
linda next question is for you is there
a free version of arcgis pro for
students or is there a package with
student pricing
yeah yeah great question um what i would
say is uh check with your university um
many universities have site licenses and
accessible licenses for students
of course you can ask one of us too so
if you'd like you know us to check in
let us know what university you're with
we can we can let you know that
there's also other ways to get access to
the technology personal use license
perhaps
so yeah
reach out we can help you find that
answer
and rami this one is for you
is it possible to show how you imported
the iom drone
images into arcgis pro into the arcgis
pro environment
uh i can share my screen but i can tell
it it's pretty easy so and if you find
the iom images which you search refugee
if you do research on google refugees
iom and arcgis you'll find one of their
web apps and in their web app there
you'll get the link for the layers and
if you click the layers you can show
details or show item details and the
item detail will take you to the service
that service you only need to copy the
link and go to arcgis pro add data from
url and you'll paste that url there and
the image is in your jazz pro
perfect and i think this is a good time
to remind everyone that we are recording
today's session you will have access to
this recording tomorrow so you can
always
replay that response if you need that
step-by-step walk through
and actually rami this next question is
for you
the details of the analysis
blew by in seconds it would be most
helpful to be provided the actual
notebooks and models to poke around and
review how the numbers are generated is
that possible
it is certainly possible and the
resources that linda shared we have the
different models that we use along with
the arcgis pro packages
and along with the deep learning package
that is out there so you can re-create
this analysis on any other different
area and also feel free to reach out to
us
in case you
had any road bumps and we're more than
happy to help you
yeah and i'll just add i've dropped a
couple extra links in the
chat here in the go to meeting so
there's really good documentation for
all of the tools that we used or that
especially i was showing in pro that go
into what are the defaults
if you just leave all the defaults what
are those values and how do they come up
with those
so there's a lot of good information
there on what goes into those analysis
in the background
i have a question for you kate can i use
network analysis tools with
openstreetmap
yeah so there's open street map
um data sets like network data sets that
you can download and then bring directly
into the tool so that's another really
powerful option to use in the network
analysis
data or tool set
also to add on what k said so in the
rohingya refugee tent example we
actually got the raw roads from osm and
we were able to create our network data
set from osm data
excellent
and rami where did you get the estimated
density for rohingya
this is available in a story map shared
by unhcr for the rohingya camp refugee
accounts they estimate per cap how many
people are living
and also on human data exchange there is
some estimates for the camps
excellent
and kate
how can i see what population data is
available for analysis
so a great place to start is the living
atlas that's where i found the esri
world population estimate data set
and there's a lot of other data sets
available through the living atlas both
that have been created by esri and that
have been uh shared by others
uh the esri data when you select it in
the living atlas you'll see a really
detailed explanation of the methodology
of how we came to those population
estimates
and there are also blog posts that go
along with those
to
really go into the details of the
analysis that got us to those population
estimates
yeah i might i might add just to what
kate said um
there there are a ton of really great
resources that we publish and and some
commercial providers that provide data
but um look for your own country data as
well right we're starting to see um
really great sharing of data from
authoritative data sources such as enegy
in mexico and others so
you know it's worth to take a little bit
of time and look around and see what you
could possibly leverage
excellent
and one last question for you oh
actually there's a couple of questions
that came in so i mean this one's for
you
um can you share the training data for
the refugee project or or is there a new
model as a result of this
the model is actually the one you're
seeing on the screen shared which is
refugee tense detect deep learning
package i actually shared that it's
available public for you to download so
i can share the data but it's around one
two tera gigabytes of data
they're already in the model so in case
there is need for that i can even share
the service that is out there
and
so rami this one's for you
do you upload your projects and codes in
the esri official github page or your
personal github pages
unfortunately this code isn't on
github
but there is an effort to get these onto
github pages where we share them with
public for now what we uploaded is
packages arcgis pro packages where you
can find the tool sets and arcgis online
and they're available public so you just
need to download
and kate this one's for you when someone
uses network analysis sometimes the
roads are generated where okay hang on
let me read that one more time
the text is so small i'm sorry everyone
when i used the network analysis
sometimes the roads i generated were in
the beach or the ocean how can i solve
that
so we would need to know a little bit
more about the input data
and the
specific
workflow to know for sure
but you can clip your output by if you
have a
um
if you have like a polygon that's the
extent of the area that you're
interested in
um that would be my first my first
troubleshooting step but yeah i would
really need to know what the input data
is and what the workflow is to
give a better answer there
excellent thank you
so with that linda it looks like our q a
is complete we don't have anything else
coming in
great great set of questions again thank
you all
really appreciate the engagement and the
set of questions again i'll point out
the many resources that are available
here
and encourage you to go take a look at
those
some really great models for you to
leverage in your work and again we
appreciate all of you being here with us
today
um noelle i'll throw it back to you um
to close it out
um i do see one other question coming in
uh if their university doesn't have a
license
in that case again i would encourage you
to look at perhaps a personal use
license um
but again if you want to let us know
you know where you're located we can try
and help you solve the the question
there
yeah thank you so thank you linda kate
and rami for all of the great
information today um thank you to
everyone that attended and gave us some
of your time we and i will repeat it we

have links to all of the resources that
linda just shared
we also have the operator we've also um
