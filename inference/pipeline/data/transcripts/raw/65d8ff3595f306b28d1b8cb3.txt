An emerging technology in
computing is quantum computing.
This is computing based
on quantum physics
rather than being based
on classical physics that
uses 1s and 0s.
This is not an upgrade to your
existing computing system,
but a type of computing that's
used alongside of our existing
computers.
This is an entirely new way
of performing calculations.
With our traditional
computers, we
use classical mechanics,
which uses bits.
Those bits are 0s
and 1s, and we can
apply algorithms
towards those 1s and 0s
to come up with a solution
to a particular problem.
With quantum computing,
we no longer have bits.
We have something called
quantum bits, or qubits.
These bits are not 1s,
and they're not 0s,
but instead, they
exist somewhere
in the middle between 1 and 0.
They are effectively a 0
and a 1 at the same time,
and therein lies some of
the complexities surrounding
quantum mechanics.
Let's compare classical
computing to quantum computing.
In our classical
computing, we might
want to perform a binary
calculation with four
separate bits, and we can take
any combination of those four
bits to come up with a value.
For example, we can combine all
of the different permutations
of those four bits,
and we can look
at every combination
of those four bits
to come up with 16
separate unique values.
With quantum computing,
we can represent all 16
of those individual classic
bits as four individual qubits
because all of those are
both 0 and 1 simultaneously.
So if it only takes
four individual qubits
to represent 16
values, we can start
to scale this up very quickly.
For example, if we had
eight different qubits,
that would represent 256 values.
If we had 16 qubits, that
represents 65,536 values.
And if we look at
32 qubits, we now
have over 4 billion values that
are represented by a relatively
small number of qubits.
It's the scalability
that provides
some of the biggest potential
advantages for quantum
computing.
This could, for
example, allow us
to search through
enormous amounts of data
in a very short period of time.
This would change
medical technology,
it might allow us to
change the way we're
able to predict
the weather, this
could have an impact in
astrophysics, and so much more.
One place that
quantum computing has
a direct effect on
technology with this scaling
is cryptography.
Today, we use very
large prime numbers
to be able to create the
complexity required to keep
all of our data encrypted.
But what if you had a
quantum computer that
was able to perform these very
large calculations in a very
short period of time?
This would
effectively render all
of our existing
cryptography useless
because our quantum computers
would be able to brute force
all of our encrypted
data very, very quickly.
A description of how this could
be done with quantum computing
was created by Peter Shor.
He created what's called
Shor's algorithm in 1994,
where he looked at how we
were using prime numbers
and came up with a way
that you could greatly
shorten the process of
being able to factor
this information.
This could take processes
that would effectively
take longer than the
lifetime of the universe
and make them
something very feasible
to use with quantum computing.
Fortunately, researchers are
already looking at new ways
to provide cryptography in this
new world of quantum computing.
One of the ways to
do this is with NTRU.
This is a new way of
performing encryption
with quantum computing that
instead of using very large
prime numbers uses a
closest vector problem.
This is a problem that is still
difficult for quantum computing
to calculate and would
be a very viable way
to provide encryption.
Researchers are also
putting together
other ideas that will help
us maintain the privacy
and encryption
technologies we need, even
in this newer generation
of quantum computing.
One interesting characteristic
of quantum computing
is that if you examine
the quantum bits,
you will effectively be
changing those quantum bits.
This means that we can send
information over a quantum
network, and on the
other side, we're
able to tell if anyone was
monitoring that conversation.
This is especially
useful if you want
to distribute encryption keys.
You might want to use Quantum
Key Distribution, or QKD.
This allows us to send
our encryption keys
across the network
to the other side
without the worry
of someone being
able to intercept that key
somewhere in the middle.
We would send that
random string of qubits,
which was effectively
our encryption key,
across that quantum
network channel.
Once the key is received, both
sides can verify that key,
and if it's
identical, then no one
viewed that key during
the transmission process.
However, if someone was to
monitor that conversation,
it would change
the keys that were
received on the other
side, and those two keys
would not verify.
This greatly changes the
processes and procedures
we use for encryption,
and we'll want
to keep a close eye
on quantum computing
as this technology matures.
