0.0,3.899,people often say you don't need to know
1.86,4.14,any math to program a computer and
3.899,3.96,that's truthy however any sufficiently
6.0,4.32,advanced technology is indistinguishable
7.859,4.501,from Magic but magic isn't real math
10.32,3.84,Explains It All developers often avoid
12.36,3.72,learning math because it looks scary but
14.16,3.66,it actually makes complicated magic like
16.08,3.72,computer graphics and neural networks
17.82,3.84,easier to understand and not just that
19.8,3.96,but it unlocks the secrets of the entire
21.66,4.08,physical Universe there's a few abstract
23.76,3.72,math concepts for programmers that you
25.74,3.18,just can't ignore and understanding them
27.48,3.78,will make you think more like a true
28.92,3.9,engineer I'm no math genius in fact I'm
31.26,3.18,the opposite which makes me uniquely
32.82,3.48,qualified to teach 10 essential math
34.44,3.48,concepts using memes and other visual
36.3,3.66,aids that almost anybody can understand
37.92,3.479,the first person who survives until the
39.96,3.72,end and cracks the code will win this
41.399,4.081,one of a kind Balenciaga fireship hoodie
43.68,4.08,let's jump right into topic number one
45.48,4.559,Boolean algebra which is used almost
47.76,3.9,every time you write code a Boolean is a
50.039,4.321,binary variable that can have two
51.66,4.44,possible values true or false now there
54.36,3.839,are three operators that you can use to
56.1,4.439,work with them and or in not or
58.199,3.721,conjunction disjunction and negation if
60.539,2.761,you want to be fancy imagine you're
61.92,3.419,trying to get a girlfriend we can use
63.3,3.78,the Boolean variables of rich and
65.339,3.6,handsome to describe you if you're both
67.08,3.719,rich and handsome you'll definitely get
68.939,3.54,a girlfriend but if you're not rich and
70.799,3.481,not handsome you'll have to pay for an
72.479,3.18,only Fan's girlfriend if you're rich or
74.28,3.6,handsome you can still get a girlfriend
75.659,3.96,but your selection is more limited we
77.88,3.54,can represent this logic and code with
79.619,3.721,things like if statements but we can
81.42,3.059,also do it visually with Venn diagrams
83.34,2.639,like you've been doing since grade
84.479,3.301,school and you can also create truth
85.979,3.421,tables like this one here which comes in
87.78,3.479,handy in zombie apocalypse type
89.4,4.62,situations but that brings us to concept
91.259,4.081,2 numeral systems like base 2 throughout
94.02,3.0,history humans have come up with all
95.34,3.54,kinds of clever ways to count things but
97.02,3.599,almost all of them use base 10 like the
98.88,4.14,10 fingers on your hands like in the
100.619,4.261,number 423 the four is in the hundreds
103.02,3.54,place which represents four times one
104.88,3.54,hundred the two is in the tens place or
106.56,3.9,two times ten then the final number is
108.42,4.26,multiplied by one but computers work off
110.46,3.96,of a base 2 numeral system in base 2
112.68,3.42,things work the exact same way but
114.42,3.659,because we only have two symbols to work
116.1,4.92,with each place is multiplied by two
118.079,5.04,like two four eight sixteen Thirty 32 64
121.02,4.44,128 and so on now that you understand
123.119,4.92,that you also understand how other bases
125.46,4.92,work like base 16 or hexadecimal which
128.039,3.78,uses the digits 0 through 9 along with a
130.38,2.999,through F and is commonly used to
131.819,3.601,represent binary values in a more
133.379,4.141,concise way because each hexadecimal
135.42,4.319,digit can translate into four bits and
137.52,4.079,you also have base64 which introduces
139.739,3.841,even more letters and symbols to encode
141.599,4.381,binary values allowing developers to
143.58,4.379,represent binary data like an image as a
145.98,3.6,string of text while computers use base
147.959,3.721,2 under the hood they still need to
149.58,3.54,represent base 10 numbers for humans and
151.68,3.0,the most common way to do that is with
153.12,4.08,floating Point numbers go ahead and
154.68,4.26,execute 0.1 plus 0.2 in your favorite
157.2,3.92,programming language the result should
158.94,2.18,be
161.3,3.659,0.30004 How could a computer make such a
163.68,3.839,silly mistake
164.959,4.42,well in science numbers can get very big
167.519,3.781,when talking about space and very small
169.379,3.181,when talking about things like atoms we
171.3,3.06,don't write these numbers out completely
172.56,3.539,and instead use scientific notation
174.36,3.239,where an exponent raises it to an
176.099,3.481,approximate value making the number
177.599,3.42,appear far more concise computers use a
179.58,3.239,similar approach with floating Point
181.019,3.661,numbers because they only have a limited
182.819,3.901,amount of space either 32 bits for
184.68,3.6,single Precision or 64 for double
186.72,3.12,Precision which is the default in
188.28,3.12,languages like Python and JavaScript
189.84,3.179,it's called a floating point because
191.4,3.419,there's no fixed number of digits before
193.019,3.3,or after the decimal point allowing
194.819,3.541,developers to make a trade-off between
196.319,4.681,range and precision some numbers like
198.36,4.14,.01 can't be represented perfectly as a
201.0,3.18,binary floating point which is the
202.5,3.3,reason we get those tiny rounding errors
204.18,3.18,now that you know how numbers work we
205.8,3.18,can start talking about logarithmic
207.36,3.659,functions which you might remember from
208.98,4.259,algebra class to understand them think
211.019,4.14,of an actual log the log starts at 16
213.239,4.201,feet then we saw it in half over and
215.159,3.66,over again until we reach a length of 2.
217.44,2.7,notice how when we try to draw a line
218.819,3.48,through it it's not perfectly straight
220.14,3.42,but rather it curves gradually in
222.299,3.121,computer science this is how many
223.56,3.36,algorithms work like binary search
225.42,3.239,what's interesting though is that if we
226.92,3.239,know how many times we cut the log we
228.659,3.36,can raise 2 to the power of that value
230.159,3.421,in this case 4 to get the original
232.019,3.841,length of the log that's called
233.58,4.079,exponentiation and logarithm is the
235.86,3.239,exact opposite imagine we don't know the
237.659,3.181,exponent we only know the original
239.099,3.241,length and want to figure out how many
240.84,3.3,times we'd have to cut the log to get a
242.34,3.72,length of 2 we could calculate that with
244.14,4.019,a base 2 log on the original length
246.06,3.959,returning a value of 4 when it's base 2
248.159,3.66,it's called a binary logarithm however
250.019,3.36,in math it's more common to use base 10
251.819,3.0,which is called the common logarithm
253.379,3.901,that'll come in handy but now let's
254.819,4.561,shift gears to set theory a set is just
257.28,3.72,an unordered collection of unique values
259.38,3.84,the best example is a relational
261.0,4.199,database where each table is a set of
263.22,3.539,unique rows these tables can be joined
265.199,3.421,together in a variety of different ways
266.759,3.601,based on set theory like to select
268.62,3.12,records that match on both tables you do
270.36,3.24,an inner join which is called an
271.74,3.42,intersection and set theory or to grab
273.6,3.539,all matching records from both tables
275.16,4.02,you do a full outer join which is a
277.139,3.901,union and set theory when doing left and
279.18,3.959,right joins these concepts are combined
281.04,3.84,like by combining an intersection with
283.139,3.0,the difference between the two sets now
284.88,2.52,one thing that's important to notice at
286.139,3.241,this point is that we're talking about
287.4,3.84,structures that have a finite number of
289.38,3.42,elements which falls under the umbrella
291.24,3.6,of discrete math as opposed to
292.8,3.899,continuous math like geometry and
294.84,3.84,calculus that deal with real numbers and
296.699,3.901,approximations and that brings us to our
298.68,4.019,next discrete topic com combinatorics
300.6,3.96,simply put this is all about counting
302.699,4.141,things especially when combining sets
304.56,3.84,into combinations or permutations like
306.84,2.639,if you have an app like Tinder you might
308.4,3.06,need to count all the possible
309.479,3.421,combinations of matches as part of a
311.46,3.06,more complex algorithm that figures out
312.9,3.12,what to show the end user where maybe
314.52,3.119,you're building a globally distributed
316.02,3.179,database and need to figure out how many
317.639,2.941,database partitions you'll need around
319.199,3.241,the world ultimately it's all about
320.58,3.36,understanding how patterns can emerge
322.44,3.599,what you're looking at here is the
323.94,3.479,formula for the Fibonacci sequence a
326.039,3.6,great exercise is to write a function
327.419,4.381,that generates it congrats bro you just
329.639,3.961,did combinatorics and unlock the secrets
331.8,3.66,of the universe engineers at Google use
333.6,3.72,the same kind of logic to render tiles
335.46,3.299,on tools like Google Maps and the gods
337.32,3.54,use this pattern all over the place in
338.759,4.201,nature combinatorics is closely related
340.86,4.74,to graph Theory a graph has two basic
342.96,4.2,parts nodes or vertices and edges that
345.6,3.599,connect them together like a person
347.16,3.479,might be a node and an edge might be a
349.199,3.361,relationship that connects them together
350.639,3.721,like you love your mom and your mom
352.56,3.6,loves you back this is an undirected
354.36,3.779,graph because the relationship goes both
356.16,4.08,ways however you might also love your
358.139,3.481,only Fan's girlfriend but this would be
360.24,3.54,a directed graph because that
361.62,3.299,relationship only goes One Way edges can
363.78,2.699,also be weighted meaning one
364.919,3.241,relationship is more important than the
366.479,3.481,other if a node can Traverse back to
368.16,3.9,itself it's called cyclic otherwise it's
369.96,3.6,known as acyclic as a programmer you'll
372.06,3.18,often need to build graphs from the
373.56,3.24,ground up but more importantly know how
375.24,3.239,to Traverse them like when using
376.8,3.119,dijkstra's algorithms you find the most
378.479,2.94,efficient way to navigate through
379.919,3.12,traffic but before you start writing
381.419,3.12,graph traversal algorithms you should
383.039,3.301,know a little bit about complexity
384.539,3.66,Theory which can tell us in theory how
386.34,3.84,much time and memory an algorithm should
388.199,3.84,use we use Big O notation to express
390.18,3.959,complexity and when talking about time
392.039,4.081,the input represents the number of steps
394.139,3.661,it will take to complete a task like if
396.12,3.66,we read a single element from an array
397.8,3.66,that would give us o of 1 or constant
399.78,3.72,time which is extremely fast and simple
401.46,3.72,if we need to Loop over an array that
403.5,3.06,would give us o of n where n is the
405.18,3.239,length of the array but if for each
406.56,3.72,iteration in that Loop we Loop over the
408.419,3.241,same array again that would give us o of
410.28,3.12,N squared which would be far less
411.66,3.78,efficient however more sophisticated
413.4,3.72,algorithms like binary search cut the
415.44,3.42,search area in half after each iteration
417.12,3.6,providing us with logarithmic time
418.86,3.54,understanding how to measure complexity
420.72,3.18,is essential for technical interviews
422.4,3.12,and is just a good thing to think about
423.9,3.54,in general but now let's move away from
425.52,3.239,discrete math and talk about statistics
427.44,2.759,which is crucial if you want to do
428.759,3.181,anything with artificial intelligence
430.199,3.661,because machine learning is kind of just
431.94,3.96,a fancy way of doing statistics like
433.86,4.02,when you type in a chat GPT it generates
435.9,3.78,a response based on the probability that
437.88,3.18,it fits the prompt provided by the user
439.68,3.66,at the very least you should understand
441.06,4.44,mean median and mode and how standard
443.34,4.139,deviation indicates how close values in
445.5,3.78,a set are correlated to the mean there's
447.479,3.241,a ton to learn beyond that but what I
449.28,3.359,found especially useful is the
450.72,3.72,difference between linear regression and
452.639,3.421,logistic regression in a linear
454.44,3.36,regression the goal is to predict a
456.06,3.24,continuous value like the amount of
457.8,3.239,money you'll lose after buying a stock
459.3,3.66,the relationship between the input and
461.039,3.66,output variable is linear and the idea
462.96,4.079,is to find a line that best fits the
464.699,3.84,data set however logistic regression is
467.039,3.72,used for an entirely different set of
468.539,3.901,problems like classification maybe an
470.759,3.66,app that predicts if an image is a hot
472.44,3.78,dog or not a hot dog in this case the
474.419,3.541,relationship is not linear but rather a
476.22,4.02,sigmoid function which might predict the
477.96,4.26,probability that a Boolean variable is
480.24,4.079,true or false and that brings us to our
482.22,4.14,final and most difficult topic linear
484.319,4.201,algebra which comes into play in things
486.36,4.02,like computer graphics and deep neural
488.52,4.32,networks to comprehend it you'll need to
490.38,4.62,understand three weird words scalar is a
492.84,4.079,single numeric value a vector is a list
495.0,4.379,of numbers like a one-dimensional array
496.919,4.441,and finally a matrix is like a grid or
499.379,3.901,two-dimensional array that contains rows
501.36,3.54,and Columns of numeric values what's
503.28,3.539,cool is that vectors can represent
504.9,3.419,points and directions in a 3D space
506.819,3.301,while matrices can represent
508.319,3.481,Transformations that happen to these
510.12,3.359,vectors when you move a player around in
511.8,3.599,a video game the lighting and shadows
513.479,3.841,and the graphics change magically but
515.399,3.781,it's not magic it's linear algebra
517.32,4.019,that's being distributed on your GPU
519.18,5.219,imagine you have a 2d Vector that's at
521.339,4.5,0.2 X 3y it represents a single point in
524.399,3.181,an image we can perform linear
525.839,4.381,Transformations here like scaling
527.58,4.439,translation rotation shear and so on
530.22,4.86,let's imagine we now want to scale the
532.019,4.741,point to a value of 4X 6y we can
535.08,3.6,represent the scaling factors in a
536.76,3.78,matrix then represent the point as a
538.68,3.9,column vector and now we can use matrix
540.54,4.02,multiplication to scale the point to its
542.58,3.12,Target location operations like this are
544.56,3.719,also essential in things like
545.7,4.199,cryptography such as RSA encryption and
548.279,3.361,are also essential in deep neural
549.899,3.661,networks which use vectors to represent
551.64,4.199,features then use matrix multiplication
553.56,3.719,to propagate values between nodes in the
555.839,3.241,network the underlying math is
557.279,3.481,surprisingly simple but requires a
559.08,3.06,massive amount of computing power to
560.76,3.48,handle the Staggering amount of data
562.14,3.66,required as you can see now math is
564.24,3.0,actually not that complicated and the
565.8,3.42,more you study it the more the computer
567.24,3.539,will reveal its magic tricks thanks for
569.22,3.799,watching and I will see you in the next
570.779,2.24,one
