3.92,5.139,quantum computers could one day solve
6.839,5.311,some of the world's toughest problems
9.059,6.05,and that do this by working completely
12.15,5.58,differently to a regular computer
15.109,9.101,information is stored in your laptop in
17.73,10.52,bits every bit is either 1 or 0 up or
24.21,8.069,down but quantum computers are made of
28.25,8.879,qubits unlike this qubits can be a
32.279,7.671,mixture of 1 & 0 at the same time
37.129,5.801,quantum computers are made of several
39.95,7.269,entangled qubits with all their stripes
42.93,7.519,connected together but actually building
47.219,6.211,a quantum computer is a challenge in
50.449,6.641,normal computers it's easy to add more
53.43,6.57,bits but for quantum computers the more
57.09,5.969,qubits you have the harder it is to add
60.0,5.7,one more this makes it tricky to scale
63.059,6.931,up from the simple quantum computer has
65.7,6.54,something more powerful another problem
69.99,5.94,is that quantum computers have to keep
72.24,5.76,their qubits protected too much
75.93,5.88,interference from the outside world and
78.0,6.09,then tangle mint is broken but
81.81,4.59,overcoming these challenges and building
84.09,7.23,a powerful quantum computer would come
86.4,6.899,with big rewards take searching imagine
91.32,4.53,you have a bunch of mixed-up business
93.299,6.301,cards how would a computer find the
95.85,6.36,right one a normal computer has to look
99.6,5.3,through one by one until it eventually
102.21,5.69,finds the right card
104.9,6.09,but a quantum computer has a trick up
107.9,6.0,its sleeve because the quantum computers
110.99,6.3,in many states at once it can search all
113.9,7.62,the cards at once after several sweeps
117.29,6.15,it claims the card and quantum computers
121.52,5.52,could help tackle all sorts of other
123.44,10.2,problems like modeling protein folding
127.04,8.88,and cracking data encryption but even if
133.64,5.55,scientists can one day build a powerful
135.92,7.35,quantum computer it probably wouldn't be
139.19,7.82,useful for everyday tasks so don't throw
143.27,3.74,away your laptop just yet
