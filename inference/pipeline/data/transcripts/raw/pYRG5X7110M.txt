0.08,3.119,what's going on everybody welcome back
1.599,3.2,to another video today we are going to
3.199,4.241,be looking at my favorite course on
4.799,2.641,statistics
8.57,4.79,[Music]
11.599,3.361,now before we get into today's video i
13.36,2.72,want to give a huge shout out to today's
14.96,3.6,sponsor which is
16.08,4.16,udemy you guys know that i absolutely
18.56,4.0,love udemy i have learned
20.24,3.76,so many things and taken so many courses
22.56,3.84,on their platform
24.0,3.199,be sure to check them out i have a page
26.4,3.039,where you can look at
27.199,3.041,every single course that i recommend on
29.439,4.081,topics like
30.24,4.64,sql excel python tableau and more
33.52,3.36,and we are going to be looking at one of
34.88,3.519,the courses that i recommend today
36.88,2.96,so huge shout outs to you to me thank
38.399,2.0,you guys so much for sponsoring this
39.84,2.0,video
40.399,3.201,so something that i get asked all the
41.84,3.6,time is alex do i need math and
43.6,2.56,statistics to become a data analyst and
45.44,3.279,my answer is
46.16,4.559,almost always no i think at the
48.719,3.201,beginning you really don't need it as
50.719,2.801,much as knowing some of the more
51.92,4.88,technical skills like
53.52,5.359,sql python tableau excel but as you get
56.8,3.599,further along in your career statistics
58.879,2.081,it does start to become more important
60.399,2.64,and so
60.96,4.0,i think that learning it and knowing it
63.039,3.76,is a really really important part of
64.96,2.64,becoming a really good data analyst in
66.799,2.64,the long term
67.6,3.92,now i know that math and statistics can
69.439,3.841,be a little bit intimidating at first
71.52,3.36,especially if you know that you're not
73.28,3.44,very good at it and so you tend to kind
74.88,3.76,of push that off and not want to learn
76.72,3.68,it i know i am guilty of that
78.64,3.6,big time but i know that if i was able
80.4,2.48,to learn it you will absolutely be able
82.24,1.76,to learn it
82.88,3.279,and the course that we're going to look
84.0,2.72,at today was one that i took and i think
86.159,2.721,is a
86.72,4.16,fantastic course it was one that i was
88.88,3.12,really intimidated to take i didn't
90.88,2.72,think that i was going to be able to
92.0,3.92,really understand the concepts
93.6,4.08,and understand it and apply it to my job
95.92,2.64,but i really was able to do that with
97.68,2.24,this course
98.56,3.199,so i'm not going to drag this out any
99.92,2.559,longer let's look at the course and see
101.759,2.32,what it is
102.479,3.201,as you can see on your screen it is
104.079,3.121,called statistics for data science and
105.68,4.16,business analysis
107.2,5.279,the cost is 60 but if you use a coupon
109.84,4.08,it will go down to 13.99
112.479,3.6,in the description i'm going to provide
113.92,4.159,a coupon that worked for me that i was
116.079,3.36,testing out just today just to make sure
118.079,1.841,that it works that you guys could have
119.439,2.64,it
119.92,4.0,i don't know how long that one will last
122.079,2.961,so there is a coupon in the description
123.92,3.04,there's also the link
125.04,3.76,to this course in the description so
126.96,2.719,check that out if you want to take this
128.8,3.04,course
129.679,3.681,but let's get into the actual course and
131.84,2.08,see what kind of things you're going to
133.36,1.84,learn
133.92,2.88,so really quickly let's look at the
135.2,3.36,different sections of this course you
136.8,2.96,have a quick introduction
138.56,2.96,then it talks about the difference
139.76,2.24,between a sample and a population and
141.52,2.16,you go into
142.0,4.239,the fundamentals of descriptive
143.68,4.96,statistics then you look at measures of
146.239,3.921,central tendency asymmetry and
148.64,3.2,variability
150.16,3.28,then it gives you a bunch of practice
151.84,3.0,examples so you actually get to
153.44,4.4,test out all these things that you're
154.84,4.92,learning then you go over distributions
157.84,3.679,estimators and estimates confidence
159.76,3.68,intervals and these are the more
161.519,3.601,advanced topics as it says
163.44,3.76,practice examples of inferential
165.12,3.759,statistics i personally thought this was
167.2,4.48,the hardest one but again
168.879,3.921,if i can get it you can get it i promise
171.68,4.24,you
172.8,4.88,then it goes into hypothesis testing
175.92,4.0,hypothesis testing where you actually
177.68,5.52,get to try these things
179.92,6.64,and put them into a real project
183.2,5.2,then it goes into some more testing um
186.56,3.759,but then it gets into the regression
188.4,2.479,analysis regression analysis is super
190.319,1.84,important
190.879,3.121,if you've never really looked into
192.159,3.36,statistics for a data analysis or data
194.0,3.599,science or anything like that
195.519,4.0,regression analysis is very popular and
197.599,3.441,so it is very good to know and this
199.519,2.08,course does a really good job at going
201.04,2.479,through that
201.599,3.28,talks a little bit more about regression
203.519,3.201,analysis and then
204.879,3.44,uh we're going to look at categorical
206.72,3.2,data and how to deal with that
208.319,4.081,and then at the very end you have a
209.92,4.16,practice example for regression analysis
212.4,3.44,now if you've never done any statistics
214.08,3.28,with actual data before
215.84,3.6,these calculations can be very
217.36,3.599,intimidating again i use that word
219.44,3.76,because that's how i felt
220.959,4.56,you may not feel that way but this stuff
223.2,4.8,looks very very confusing uh
225.519,4.161,the thing that i love most about this
228.0,4.0,course right here is it makes it
229.68,4.0,super super simple and it uses really
232.0,3.04,good simple examples
233.68,3.04,and how to actually walk through these
235.04,3.36,so that you can understand them and then
236.72,2.64,you get to practice them afterwards
238.4,4.08,typically in a small
239.36,5.599,practice example or a quiz i personally
242.48,4.319,found this extremely useful i didn't
244.959,3.521,know it at the time but in a previous
246.799,2.241,job i was actually doing a lot of this
248.48,2.0,stuff
249.04,3.279,i just didn't know what it was called
250.48,3.039,and so it was really funny when i
252.319,3.12,started taking this course
253.519,3.361,after i'd had my very first job as a
255.439,3.281,data analyst
256.88,3.039,i actually was using a lot of these
258.72,3.919,different calculations
259.919,4.0,to get my work done and so i didn't even
262.639,3.681,know what i was doing
263.919,3.84,i just was doing it and so now that i
266.32,3.12,can actually make some sense of it and
267.759,2.961,understand it it became a lot more
269.44,2.8,useful and so
270.72,2.96,this really helped me put into
272.24,2.08,perspective some of the work that i was
273.68,2.799,doing
274.32,3.52,but also gave me a lot of ideas for some
276.479,2.321,more advanced things that i could be
277.84,2.4,doing as well
278.8,2.56,now i'm really not going to go super in
280.24,1.84,depth into everything that you're going
281.36,2.8,to learn in this
282.08,3.76,course i feel like if you don't know
284.16,3.2,statistics super well
285.84,2.56,me walking through each of the things
287.36,2.16,that you're going to learn really won't
288.4,2.4,make a huge difference
289.52,3.28,but as you're walking through this
290.8,3.52,course it starts out super simple
292.8,3.679,it goes even to the more advanced
294.32,4.319,concept and it's all done in excel
296.479,3.921,or on some type of like powerpoint so
298.639,3.361,it's not really that difficult you don't
300.4,2.72,have to download any special software as
302.0,2.88,long as you have excel
303.12,3.44,you can do everything that they do in
304.88,2.64,this video so to go back to something
306.56,2.479,that i was talking about
307.52,3.28,earlier when somebody asked me where
309.039,2.16,they can learn math and statistics i
310.8,1.839,almost
311.199,3.361,always point them to this course right
312.639,3.441,here and that's because i have taken it
314.56,3.28,i have come back to it time and time
316.08,2.72,again and i've learned a lot of things
317.84,2.639,from this course
318.8,3.36,as well as actually used it in my job
320.479,2.321,and so i know it's actually applicable
322.16,1.84,it's not
322.8,3.119,just something that you're gonna take
324.0,3.44,and never ever use again this is
325.919,3.361,something that i promise
327.44,3.84,everyone who becomes a data analyst or
329.28,3.84,data scientist they will use something
331.28,3.04,in this video whether they know it or
333.12,2.96,not but
334.32,3.68,knowing it and understanding what you're
336.08,3.6,actually doing is extremely beneficial
338.0,4.08,and i came to learn that kind of the
339.68,5.12,hard way or later on
342.08,4.24,in my career and so i'm glad that i took
344.8,2.88,this course i'm really glad that i can
346.32,3.12,share it with you
347.68,3.2,i hope that if you take it you can
349.44,3.599,really understand the concepts and
350.88,3.68,really apply it to your career thank you
353.039,3.28,guys so much for watching i really
354.56,3.44,appreciate it if you like this video be
