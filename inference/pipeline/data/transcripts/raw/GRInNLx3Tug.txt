6.0,5.12,hello everyone welcome back to today's
8.96,4.639,lecture of computer organization and
11.12,4.399,architecture so today we will be
13.599,5.44,learning about computer architecture in
15.519,5.6,a bit details so let's get to learning
19.039,4.4,let's start with the formal definition
21.119,4.561,of computer architecture so it's
23.439,4.241,basically the design of computers
25.68,4.08,including their instructions its
27.68,5.12,hardware components and system
29.76,5.76,organization now it has got two parts
32.8,5.2,first the instruction set architecture
35.52,5.199,which includes the specification that
38.0,5.44,determine how machine language programs
40.719,4.721,will interact with the computer next we
43.44,4.08,have the hardware system architecture
45.44,5.119,which deals with the computer's major
47.52,5.84,hardware subsystems like cpu storage
50.559,4.801,input output etc it includes both the
53.36,4.4,logical design and the data flow
55.36,4.879,organization of the subsystems and hence
57.76,4.16,determines their efficiency let's try
60.239,4.0,and understand this concept with the
61.92,5.36,help of an illustration suppose we want
64.239,5.681,to add two values 2 and 3 and store the
67.28,4.8,added value in a variable named x now
69.92,4.16,this simplification can be performed in
72.08,4.8,various ways based on the available
74.08,4.56,hardware these are some examples of the
76.88,4.48,different ways the simplification can be
78.64,4.799,performed now from these one or more
81.36,4.32,ways can be selected for a specific type
83.439,3.521,of computer this c is nothing but the
85.68,4.16,isa
86.96,5.6,suppose this one is selected so all the
89.84,5.52,other operations will also have similar
92.56,5.12,type of instructions now based on this
95.36,4.719,the hardware will be chosen as in this
97.68,4.88,specific case we will need at least two
100.079,4.801,different memory locations and an added
102.56,5.599,circuit it is the rudimentary concept of
104.88,5.279,hardware system architecture or the hsa
108.159,3.6,now it's really important to distinguish
110.159,4.401,a computer's architecture from its
111.759,4.4,implementation i hope it was also clear
114.56,3.36,from our previous discussion that the
116.159,4.081,implementation is the realization of
117.92,5.519,computer in hardware and includes the
120.24,4.0,choice of technology speed cost and so
123.439,2.96,on
124.24,4.799,whereas the architecture doesn't really
126.399,4.241,define an implementation yet they both
129.039,3.92,influence one another
130.64,4.4,generally computers with the same isa
132.959,3.841,will run the same kind of programs and
135.04,4.64,are also said to belong to the same
136.8,5.12,family this concept will be more clear
139.68,3.6,as we progress eventually now we will
141.92,3.44,move on to the classifications of
143.28,4.0,computer architecture but before diving
145.36,3.92,straight into it a bit of a history
147.28,3.599,lesson is required so that we can
149.28,4.239,properly understand various
150.879,4.561,nomenclatures now we already know that
153.519,4.161,computer architecture is the design of
155.44,4.159,computers and the great great great
157.68,4.559,ancestor of today's ultra-modern
159.599,4.801,computing devices was the analytical
162.239,4.561,engine it was the first proposed
164.4,4.8,mechanical general purpose computer
166.8,5.28,designed by the great computer pioneer
169.2,5.119,charles babbage he was assisted by lady
172.08,4.4,ada lovelace who was the first one to
174.319,4.081,come up with the basic idea of having a
176.48,3.44,language in order to operate the
178.4,4.32,proposed machine
179.92,5.28,so all the ladies out there more power
182.72,4.159,to you if it was not for lady lovelace
185.2,5.2,we wouldn't be enjoying the luxury of
186.879,6.64,software today and just an fyi lady
190.4,6.08,loveless was tutored by d d morgan
193.519,4.64,augustus de morgan whose de morgan's law
196.48,4.16,brought revolution to the world of
198.159,5.121,boolean algebra of george bull we all
200.64,5.159,know about that right then comes the
203.28,5.599,next big milestone the advent of
205.799,5.0,computability and non-computability
208.879,4.64,alan turing figured it out which
210.799,4.641,problems can be solved using computers
213.519,3.44,he has widely been considered as the
215.44,3.92,father of computer science and
216.959,5.2,artificial intelligence since then now
219.36,5.519,alongside turing another name is very
222.159,5.761,frequently associated with computation
224.879,6.241,and it is johan von neumann or more
227.92,5.679,popularly known as john von neumann this
231.12,4.72,very hungarian genius was not only a
233.599,3.84,child prodigy who could divide an
235.84,3.28,eight-digit number by another
237.439,3.681,eight-digit number within just a
239.12,4.72,fraction of second when he was just
241.12,5.119,about 6 years old but also the great
243.84,4.479,mathematician who grabbed the full-time
246.239,5.28,professor position at princeton
248.319,5.761,university by the age probably 30. yes
251.519,5.12,you heard me right not a reader not a
254.08,4.08,lecturer but a full-time professor by
256.639,4.56,the age of 30.
258.16,5.36,funny story neumann even offered turing
261.199,4.641,for research assistantship under his
263.52,4.399,supervision quantum mechanics at the
265.84,4.079,institute of advanced studies where only
267.919,2.881,the greatest of minds were invited to
269.919,3.521,work
270.8,4.399,also after the second world war newman
273.44,3.68,brought together gems from around the
275.199,3.761,world to work as a team in the
277.12,4.16,advancement of computation
278.96,4.56,alright enough with the history for now
281.28,4.24,let's get to know about why we are so
283.52,4.8,much interested about this marvelous
285.52,4.8,character john von neumann you remember
288.32,4.24,this typical block diagram of computer
290.32,4.64,from our previous session right well
292.56,5.44,this is the person behind it this
294.96,6.0,architecture is named also after him and
298.0,5.759,known as von neumann architecture
300.96,4.959,so to conclude i would like to quote
303.759,4.641,another genius professor david
305.919,4.481,brailsford of university of nottingham
308.4,5.2,who has been teaching computer science
310.4,5.04,for more than 50 years now and i believe
313.6,4.96,no one could explain this in a better
315.44,5.92,way he says if turing is the father and
318.56,5.44,babbage was the grandfather and if lady
321.36,5.279,ada countess of loveless was the great
324.0,5.039,aunt then john von neumann was the
326.639,5.521,impossibly talented impossibly
329.039,4.481,charismatic very wealthy uncle to
332.16,3.68,computing
333.52,4.56,alright people that will be all for this
335.84,4.16,session and i'm pretty confident that we
338.08,3.839,all are now ready for the next session
340.0,4.32,where we dive straight into the various
341.919,4.321,classifications of computer architecture
344.32,3.24,see you in the next one thank you all
346.24,3.5,for watching
347.56,10.359,[Applause]
349.74,10.26,[Music]
357.919,2.081,you
