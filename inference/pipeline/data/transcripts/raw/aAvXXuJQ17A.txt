0.0,5.58,so usually the way this works is we
3.27,4.95,bring students into the lab they sit
5.58,3.93,down we read instructions together so
8.22,2.999,that everyone knows that everyone's
9.51,3.839,playing the same game and they're all
11.219,4.05,playing under the same rules and the
13.349,5.1,voluntary contribution mechanism game is
15.269,5.67,it's very simple students are given
18.449,5.431,endowment usually like twenty dollars
20.939,6.211,and they have a choice they can keep the
23.88,7.53,money for themselves you know one dollar
27.15,6.78,gives them one dollar or they can kind
31.41,5.25,of invest it in this group account and
33.93,4.649,the group account pays something like
36.66,3.39,forty cents to them but it also pays
38.579,3.061,forty cents to each of the other people
40.05,4.47,in the group so usually these are small
41.64,4.47,groups like four people so an investment
44.52,4.05,in the group and count of a dollar would
46.11,5.219,pay one point six dollars to the group
48.57,4.77,so it's better off with a group for
51.329,3.781,everyone to contribute to the group
53.34,3.48,account that will give them the most
55.11,3.179,payoff but individually they have the
56.82,2.61,incentive to keep the dollar because
58.289,7.16,they're only getting forty cents
59.43,6.019,themselves so it's the basic vcm game
