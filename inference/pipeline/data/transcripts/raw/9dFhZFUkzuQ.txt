4.08,4.24,simply learn welcomes you to
6.24,4.8,machine learning versus deep learning
8.32,5.199,versus artificial intelligence some of
11.04,4.16,the most exciting technologies evolving
13.519,3.201,in today's world
15.2,3.919,my name is richard kirschner and i'll be
16.72,4.719,hosting this talk or simply learn
19.119,4.4,before we start covering the basics of
21.439,3.92,these three topics and how they connect
23.519,3.52,and how they are different let's just
25.359,4.16,look at a few examples so we get an
27.039,3.841,understanding of what's going on
29.519,3.841,here's an example of artificial
30.88,3.679,intelligence in today's world amazon
33.36,3.44,echo
34.559,4.32,amazon echo is a wonderful tool we can
36.8,4.24,go in there and you can say hey alexa
38.879,4.641,what's the temperature in chicago
41.04,4.72,and the amazon echo then translates that
43.52,4.0,into zeros and ones and something the
45.76,4.16,computer understands
47.52,4.16,then it comes in and processes that
49.92,3.279,information to identify what you're
51.68,3.6,asking and what you need and where to
53.199,4.081,get that information and then it comes
55.28,3.919,back and says the current temperature in
57.28,3.919,chicago is six degrees fahrenheit or
59.199,3.52,whatever it is at the moment
61.199,3.28,so this is a wonderful example of
62.719,3.921,artificial intelligence that we're using
64.479,4.161,right now today where that's at as far
66.64,4.0,as a commercial deployment
68.64,4.0,machine learning a machine learning
70.64,4.64,example out there is google you're on
72.64,4.72,your google search engine it comes up
75.28,4.479,you spend a lot of time on the first
77.36,3.2,link you come into and you read the page
79.759,2.241,and
80.56,3.599,google looks at that and says okay he
82.0,3.439,spent five minutes on this let's give it
84.159,3.201,a thumbs up
85.439,3.441,and then you go to the second page and
87.36,2.72,the third page you just kind of skip
88.88,3.52,over them and glance at them for a
90.08,3.679,couple seconds and google says i wasn't
92.4,2.88,interested in those pages let's give
93.759,2.801,them a thumbs down
95.28,3.28,so this is a good example of machine
96.56,3.84,learning as it starts guessing what you
98.56,3.199,like and what you don't like so it gives
100.4,3.92,you more information along what you're
101.759,4.481,going to read and actually use
104.32,3.2,and then we have an example of deep
106.24,3.199,learning
107.52,3.36,in this example we have a black and
109.439,4.081,white image
110.88,3.68,it comes into in this case a neural
113.52,3.04,network
114.56,3.599,some people like to call it a magic box
116.56,3.199,because you really it's hard to follow
118.159,3.441,all that's going on in there there's all
119.759,3.201,these different weights and connections
121.6,3.119,and nodes
122.96,4.4,and then it comes out
124.719,4.16,and colors the beach ball the people the
127.36,3.36,background
128.879,3.44,what's going on in here is the black and
130.72,4.4,white image goes into this neural
132.319,4.721,network and before it's ever gone in
135.12,4.16,the neural network has looked at all
137.04,4.16,these different pictures on the web or
139.28,3.84,wherever it pulls the data from
141.2,3.759,and it's already itemized them and kind
143.12,3.68,of separated them that
144.959,3.601,we have some that look like beach balls
146.8,3.84,we have some that look like people and
148.56,3.759,it programs that so that when the black
150.64,3.2,and white image comes in it goes okay
152.319,3.28,that piece right there
153.84,3.2,resembles this and all these other
155.599,4.161,photos
157.04,4.479,and the network is able to identify that
159.76,3.92,and then color the beach ball with the
161.519,3.44,colors that you see on there so it gives
163.68,2.8,it this is really wonderful because they
164.959,2.56,did a wonderful job coloring this
166.48,2.8,picture
167.519,3.761,and that's the full setup is where the
169.28,4.959,deep learning example comes in and they
171.28,5.84,usually center around neural networks
174.239,4.161,so we looked at a few examples what's in
177.12,2.72,it for you
178.4,4.08,first we're going to talk about human
179.84,4.56,versus artificial intelligence
182.48,4.88,this is very important because
184.4,5.199,this is our marker we as humans are
187.36,4.64,amazing and so we want to understand how
189.599,4.64,artificial intelligence compares
192.0,4.319,and what it does that it can accelerate
194.239,4.161,above humans and how it can integrate
196.319,3.521,with the human experience
198.4,3.44,what is machine learning and deep
199.84,3.36,learning all about are they really all
201.84,3.679,that different
203.2,3.44,we'll have a few more examples in here
205.519,3.201,and then we'll talk a little bit about
206.64,3.679,types of ai and machine learning and
208.72,4.079,comparing machine learning in deep
210.319,4.64,learning and finally a glimpse into the
212.799,5.921,future
214.959,5.761,human versus artificial intelligence
218.72,3.84,humans are amazing let's just face it
220.72,4.32,we're amazing creatures we're all over
222.56,6.48,the planet we're exploring
225.04,6.08,every nic chinook we've gone to the moon
229.04,3.759,we've gone into outer space we're just
231.12,3.199,amazing creatures
232.799,4.08,we're able to use the available
234.319,4.401,information to make decisions
236.879,4.241,to communicate with other people
238.72,4.96,identify patterns and data remember what
241.12,3.839,people have said adapt to new situations
243.68,2.4,so let's take a look at this so we so
244.959,2.801,you can get a picture you're a human
246.08,2.96,being so you know it's like to be human
247.76,4.0,let's take a look at artificial
249.04,4.72,intelligence versus the human artificial
251.76,4.24,intelligence develops computer systems
253.76,4.719,that can accomplish texts that require
256.0,4.16,human intelligence
258.479,3.28,so we're looking at this
260.16,4.8,one of the things that computers can do
261.759,5.041,they can provide more accurate results
264.96,4.0,this is very important
266.8,4.8,recently i did a project on
268.96,4.799,cancer whereas identifying markers
271.6,4.4,and as a human being you look at that
273.759,4.88,and you might be looking at all the
276.0,4.8,different images and the data that comes
278.639,6.0,off of them and say i like this person
280.8,5.839,so i want to give them a very good
284.639,3.28,outlook and the next person you might
286.639,3.12,not like so you want to give him a bad
287.919,2.961,outlook well with artificial
289.759,3.281,intelligence you're going to get a
290.88,4.16,consistent prediction of what's going to
293.04,3.599,come out interacts with humans using
295.04,2.96,their natural language we've seen that
296.639,2.641,as probably the biggest development
298.0,2.88,feature right now that's in the
299.28,3.919,commercial market that everybody gets to
300.88,4.64,use as we saw with the example of alexa
303.199,4.401,they learn from their mistakes and adapt
305.52,4.959,to new environments so we see this
307.6,4.8,slowly coming in more and more and they
310.479,3.841,learn from the data and automate
312.4,4.56,repetitive learning
314.32,5.12,repetitive learning has a lot to do with
316.96,4.4,the neural networks you have to program
319.44,5.28,thousands upon thousands of pictures in
321.36,5.92,there and it's all automated so as
324.72,5.44,today's computers evolve it's very quick
327.28,4.4,and easy and affordable to do this
330.16,3.44,what is machine learning and deep
331.68,3.92,learning all about
333.6,3.68,imagine this say you had some time to
335.6,3.52,waste not that any of us really have a
337.28,3.199,lot of time anymore to just waste in
339.12,2.96,today's world
340.479,3.201,and you're sitting by the road and you
342.08,4.8,have a whole lot of and a whole lot of
343.68,5.2,time passes by there's a few hours
346.88,4.319,and suddenly you wonder
348.88,4.879,how many cars buses trucks and so on
351.199,4.081,passed by in the six hours
353.759,3.121,now chances are you're not going to sit
355.28,3.44,by the road for six hours and count
356.88,3.2,buses cars and trucks unless you're
358.72,3.6,working for the city and you're trying
360.08,4.32,to do city planning and you want to know
362.32,3.68,hey do we need to add a new truck route
364.4,3.68,maybe we need a bicycle length we have a
366.0,3.68,lot of bicyclists here that kind of
368.08,3.36,thing so maybe city planning would be
369.68,3.519,great for this
371.44,3.84,machine learning well the way machine
373.199,4.881,learning works is we
375.28,6.16,have labeled data with features
378.08,5.92,okay so you have a truck or a car a
381.44,4.24,motorcycle a bus or a bicycle and each
384.0,4.639,one of those are labeled
385.68,5.04,it comes in and based on those labels
388.639,3.921,and comparing those features it gives
390.72,4.08,you an answer it's a bicycle it's a
392.56,4.24,truck it's a motorcycle this is a little
394.8,3.839,bit more in depth on this
396.8,3.44,and the model here it actually the
398.639,3.921,features we're looking at would be like
400.24,4.72,the tires someone sits there and figures
402.56,4.24,out what a tire looks like it takes a
404.96,3.519,lot of work if you try to try to figure
406.8,4.399,the difference between a car tire a
408.479,5.121,bicycle tire a motorcycle tire
411.199,3.681,so in the machine learning field this
413.6,3.36,could take a long time if you're going
414.88,4.08,to do each individual
416.96,4.0,aspect of a car
418.96,4.079,and try to get a result on there and
420.96,4.079,that's what they did do that was a very
423.039,3.761,this is still used on smaller amounts of
425.039,4.16,data where you figure out what those
426.8,5.839,features are and then you label them
429.199,5.601,deep learning so with deep learning
432.639,5.041,one of our solutions is to take a very
434.8,5.119,large unlabeled data set
437.68,4.56,and we put that into a training model
439.919,4.321,using artificial neural networks and
442.24,3.92,then that goes into the neural network
444.24,3.6,itself when we create a neural network
446.16,4.0,and you'll see the arrows are actually
447.84,4.0,kind of backward but which actually is a
450.16,3.36,nice point because when we train the
451.84,3.44,neural network
453.52,3.84,we put the bicycle in and then it comes
455.28,3.759,back and says if it's a truck it comes
457.36,4.0,back and says well you need to change
459.039,3.841,that to bicycle and then it changes all
461.36,3.2,those weights going backward they call
462.88,3.36,it back propagation
464.56,3.52,and let it know it's a bicycle and
466.24,4.399,that's how it learns
468.08,4.559,once you've trained the neural network
470.639,3.601,you then put the new data in and they
472.639,3.041,call this testing the model so you need
474.24,3.28,to have some data you've kept off to the
475.68,3.359,side where you know the answer to
477.52,3.44,and you take that and you provide the
479.039,3.44,required output and you say okay is this
480.96,3.76,is this neural network working correctly
482.479,5.361,did it identify a bike as a bike a truck
484.72,4.479,as a truck a motorcycle as a motorcycle
487.84,2.4,let's just take a little closer look at
489.199,2.881,that
490.24,3.44,determining what objects are present in
492.08,3.28,the data so how does deep learning do
493.68,2.56,this and here we have the image of the
495.36,4.72,bike
496.24,5.92,it's 28 by 28 pixels that's a lot of
500.08,3.76,information there could you imagine
502.16,3.92,trying to guess that this is a bicycle
503.84,3.68,image by looking at each one of those
506.08,2.88,pixels and trying to figure out what's
507.52,3.04,around it
508.96,2.799,and we actually do that as human beings
510.56,3.2,it's pretty amazing we know what a
511.759,3.681,bicycle is and even though it comes in
513.76,3.519,as all this information
515.44,3.2,and what this looks like is the image
517.279,3.841,comes in
518.64,4.24,it converts it into a bunch of different
521.12,3.6,nodes in this case there's a lot more
522.88,3.12,than what they show here and it goes
524.72,4.239,through these different layers and out
526.0,4.959,comes and says okay this is a bicycle
528.959,4.481,a lot of times they call this the magic
530.959,3.921,black box why because as we watch it go
533.44,3.12,across here
534.88,3.6,all these weights
536.56,3.76,and all the math behind this and it's
538.48,3.76,not it's a little complicated on the
540.32,3.36,math side you really don't need to know
542.24,3.2,that when you're programming or doing
543.68,3.599,working with the deep learning but it's
545.44,3.44,like magic you don't know you really
547.279,2.961,can't figure out what's going to come
548.88,2.8,out by looking what's in each one of
550.24,2.96,those dots and each one of those lines
551.68,3.76,are firing and what's going in between
553.2,3.92,them so we like to call it the magic box
555.44,2.959,uh so that's where deep learning comes
557.12,2.48,in
558.399,2.56,and in the end it comes up and you have
559.6,3.679,this whole neural network comes up and
560.959,4.0,says okay we fire all these different
563.279,3.68,pixels and we connects all these
564.959,4.32,different dots and gives them different
566.959,3.601,weights and says okay this is a bicycle
569.279,3.841,and that's how we determine what the
570.56,3.92,object is present in the data with deep
573.12,3.12,learning
574.48,3.44,machine learning we're going to take a
576.24,3.039,step into machine learning here and
577.92,3.359,you'll see how these fit together in a
579.279,4.641,minute the system is able to make
581.279,5.281,predictions or take decisions based on
583.92,5.599,past data that's very important for
586.56,4.48,machine learning is that we're
589.519,2.88,looking at stuff and based on what's
591.04,3.76,been there before
592.399,4.081,we're creating a decision on there we're
594.8,3.12,creating something out of there we're
596.48,2.799,coloring a beach ball we're telling you
597.92,2.96,what the weather is
599.279,3.841,in chicago
600.88,5.12,what's nice about machine learning is a
603.12,5.04,very powerful processing capability it's
606.0,3.92,quick and accurate outcomes
608.16,4.08,so you get results right away once you
609.92,3.44,program the system the results are very
612.24,3.92,fast
613.36,4.4,and the decisions and predictions are
616.16,4.32,better they're more accurate they're
617.76,4.16,consistent you can analyze very large
620.48,2.88,amounts of data
621.92,3.68,some of these data things that they're
623.36,4.88,analyzing now are petabytes and
625.6,4.4,terabytes of data it would take
628.24,3.279,hundreds of people
630.0,3.04,hundreds of years to go through some of
631.519,3.041,this data and do the same thing that the
633.04,3.76,machine learning can do in a very short
634.56,4.24,period of time and it's inexpensive
636.8,4.24,compared to hiring hundreds of people so
638.8,4.32,it becomes a very affordable way to move
641.04,2.96,into the future is to apply the machine
643.12,4.0,learning
644.0,5.04,to whatever businesses you're working on
647.12,4.0,and deep learning systems think and
649.04,4.56,learn like humans using artificial
651.12,5.36,neural networks again it's like a magic
653.6,5.6,box performance improves with more data
656.48,4.96,so the more data the deep learning gets
659.2,4.56,the more it gives you better results
661.44,4.56,it's scalability so you can scale it up
663.76,3.759,you can scale it down you can increase
666.0,3.44,what you're looking at
667.519,3.921,currently you know we're limited by the
669.44,3.92,amount of computer processing power as
671.44,3.839,to how big that can get but that
673.36,4.08,envelope continually gets pushed every
675.279,4.481,day on what it can do
677.44,5.2,problem solved in an end-to-end method
679.76,5.44,so instead of having to break it apart
682.64,4.8,and you have the first piece coming in
685.2,4.319,and you identify tires and the second
687.44,3.92,piece is identifying
689.519,3.281,labeling handlebars and then you bring
691.36,3.76,that together that if it has handlebars
692.8,4.64,and tires it's a bicycle and if it has
695.12,4.159,something that looks like a large square
697.44,4.0,it's probably a truck the neural
699.279,3.441,networks does this all in one network
701.44,2.639,you don't really know what's going on in
702.72,2.72,all those weights and all those little
704.079,3.44,bubbles
705.44,5.12,but it does it pretty much
707.519,4.961,in one package that's why the neural
710.56,3.76,network systems are so big nowadays and
712.48,4.0,coming into their own
714.32,3.6,best features are selected by the system
716.48,3.52,and it this is important they kind of
717.92,5.2,put it it's on a bullet on the side here
720.0,4.399,it's a subset of machine learning this
723.12,3.68,is important
724.399,4.081,we talk about deep learning it is a form
726.8,3.44,of machine learning there's lots of
728.48,3.919,other forms of machine learning data
730.24,3.839,analysis but this is the newest and
732.399,3.44,biggest thing that they apply to a lot
734.079,3.2,of different packages and they use all
735.839,4.081,the other machine learning tools
737.279,4.081,available to work with it and it's very
739.92,3.28,fast to test
741.36,4.719,you put in your information
743.2,5.12,you then have your group of tests
746.079,3.921,and then you held some aside you see how
748.32,3.04,does it do it's very quick to test it
750.0,3.279,and see what's going on with your deep
751.36,5.2,learning in your neural network
753.279,5.521,are they really all that different
756.56,3.2,ai versus machine learning versus deep
758.8,3.039,learning
759.76,4.48,concepts of ai
761.839,4.641,so we have concepts of iii you'll see
764.24,3.92,natural language processing
766.48,3.84,machine learning an approach to create
768.16,4.56,artificial intelligence so it's one of
770.32,4.4,the subsets of artificial intelligence
772.72,4.16,knowledge representation automated
774.72,3.52,reasoning computer vision
776.88,3.759,robotics
778.24,4.88,machine learning versus ai versus deep
780.639,4.32,learning or ai and machine learning and
783.12,3.76,deep learning
784.959,4.721,so we look at this we have ai with
786.88,4.0,machine learning and deep learning and
789.68,3.36,so we're going to put them all together
790.88,3.92,we find out that ai is the big picture
793.04,3.84,we have a collection of books
794.8,5.2,it goes through some deep learning
796.88,4.32,the digital data is analyzed text mining
800.0,3.04,comes through
801.2,5.52,the particular book you're looking for
803.04,5.76,maybe it's a genre books is identified
806.72,4.16,and in this case we have a robot that
808.8,3.599,goes and gives a book to the patron i
810.88,3.28,have yet to be at a library that has a
812.399,3.521,robot bring me a book but that will be
814.16,4.239,cool when it happens
815.92,5.039,as we look at some of the pieces here
818.399,4.641,this information goes into
820.959,4.081,there's as far as this example
823.04,4.56,the translation of the handwritten
825.04,4.479,printed data to digital form
827.6,3.28,that's pretty hard to do that's pretty
829.519,3.361,hard to go in there and translate
830.88,4.959,hundreds and hundreds of books
832.88,5.84,and understand what they're trying to
835.839,5.041,say if you've never read them so in this
838.72,4.0,case we use the deep learning because
840.88,3.28,you can already use examples where
842.72,3.2,they've already classified a lot of
844.16,4.479,books and then they can compare those
845.92,5.44,texts and say oh okay this is a book on
848.639,5.121,automotive repair this is a book on
851.36,5.279,robotic building the digital data is in
853.76,5.28,analyzed then we have more text mining
856.639,4.56,using machine learning so maybe we'd use
859.04,3.599,a different program to do a basic
861.199,2.721,classify
862.639,2.64,what you're looking for and say oh
863.92,3.599,you're looking for
865.279,4.161,auto repair and computers so you're
867.519,3.361,looking for automated cars once it's
869.44,3.519,identified then of course it brings you
870.88,3.92,the book
872.959,4.081,so here's a nice summation of what we
874.8,4.56,were just talking about ai with machine
877.04,4.32,learning and deep learning deep learning
879.36,4.96,is a subset of machine learning which is
881.36,4.4,a subset of artificial intelligence so
884.32,3.84,you can look at artificial intelligence
885.76,4.48,as the big picture how does this compare
888.16,4.479,to the human experience
890.24,4.719,in either doing the same thing as a
892.639,4.961,human we do or it
894.959,5.201,does it better than us and machine
897.6,5.2,learning which has a lot of tools
900.16,5.84,uh is something that learns from data
902.8,5.12,past experiences it's programmed it's uh
906.0,3.92,comes in there and it says hey we
907.92,4.159,already had these five things happen the
909.92,4.08,sixth one should be about the same and
912.079,3.681,then there's a lot of tools in machine
914.0,3.92,learning but deep learning then is a
915.76,4.0,very specific tool in machine learning
917.92,4.32,it's the artificial neural network which
919.76,4.96,handles large amounts of data and is
922.24,5.039,able to take huge pools
924.72,4.4,of experiences pictures and ideas and
927.279,4.24,bring them together
929.12,5.04,real life examples
931.519,4.56,artificial intelligence news generation
934.16,4.239,very common nowadays as it goes through
936.079,5.041,there and finds the news articles or
938.399,3.761,generates the news based upon the news
941.12,3.839,feeds
942.16,4.72,or the back end coming in and says okay
944.959,4.0,let's give you the actual news based on
946.88,3.84,this there's all the different things
948.959,4.0,amazon echo they have a number of
950.72,3.679,different prime music on there of course
952.959,4.161,there's also the
954.399,6.24,google command and there's also
957.12,5.76,cortana there's tons of smart home
960.639,5.2,devices now where we can ask it to turn
962.88,5.04,the tv on or play music for us that's
965.839,3.201,all artificial intelligence from front
967.92,3.52,to back
969.04,5.44,you're having a human experience
971.44,4.639,with these computers and these
974.48,4.24,objects that are connected to the
976.079,4.76,processing machine learning
978.72,4.88,spam detection very common machine
980.839,4.601,learning doesn't really have the human
983.6,3.679,interaction part
985.44,3.6,so this is the part where it goes and
987.279,5.12,says okay that's a spam that's not a
989.04,5.599,spam and it puts it in your spam folder
992.399,4.081,search engine result refining
994.639,3.841,another example of of
996.48,4.479,machine learning whereas it looks at
998.48,4.96,your different results and it go and it
1000.959,4.481,is able to categorize them as far as it
1003.44,4.72,said the most hits this is the least
1005.44,4.319,viewed this has five stars you know
1008.16,3.28,however they want to weight it
1009.759,4.241,all exactly good examples of machine
1011.44,4.72,learning and then the deep learning uh
1014.0,4.56,deep learning another example is
1016.16,4.72,as you have like a exit sign
1018.56,3.44,in this case is translating it into
1020.88,4.079,french
1022.0,4.48,sorti i hope i said that right
1024.959,3.281,neural network has been programmed with
1026.48,4.079,all these different words and images and
1028.24,4.4,so it's able to look at the exit in the
1030.559,3.52,middle and it goes okay we want to know
1032.64,4.0,what that is in french and it's able to
1034.079,5.441,push that out in france french
1036.64,4.799,and learn how to do that
1039.52,3.6,and then we have chat bots
1041.439,4.081,i remember when microsoft first had
1043.12,5.12,their little paper clip um boy that was
1045.52,5.2,like a long time ago they came up and
1048.24,4.0,you would type in there and chat with it
1050.72,3.44,these are growing you know it's nice to
1052.24,4.0,just be able to ask a question and it
1054.16,4.399,comes up and gives you the answer
1056.24,5.2,and instead of it being were you just
1058.559,4.24,doing a search on certain words it's now
1061.44,3.52,able to start linking those words
1062.799,3.601,together and form a sentence in that
1064.96,4.64,chat box
1066.4,5.6,types of ai and machine learning
1069.6,4.48,types of artificial intelligence this in
1072.0,3.6,the next few slides are really important
1074.08,4.08,so one of the types of artificial
1075.6,4.72,intelligence is reactive machines
1078.16,3.36,systems that only react they don't form
1080.32,2.719,memories they don't have past
1081.52,3.92,experiences they have something that
1083.039,5.281,happens to them and they react to it
1085.44,5.599,my washing machine is one of those
1088.32,4.8,if i put a ton of clothes in it and it
1091.039,4.081,all clumped on one side
1093.12,4.559,it automatically adds a weight to
1095.12,4.4,recenter it so that my washing machine
1097.679,4.641,is actually a reactive machine working
1099.52,4.96,with whatever the load is and keeps it
1102.32,3.84,nice and so when it spins it doesn't go
1104.48,3.28,thumping against the side
1106.16,3.2,limited memory another form of
1107.76,3.76,artificial intelligence
1109.36,4.0,systems look into the past
1111.52,4.96,information is added over a period of
1113.36,5.28,time and information is short-lived when
1116.48,3.84,we're talking about this and you look at
1118.64,4.08,like a neural network that's been
1120.32,5.12,programmed to identify cars
1122.72,5.04,it doesn't remember all those pictures
1125.44,4.56,it has no memory as far as the hundreds
1127.76,4.56,of pictures you process through it all
1130.0,4.48,it has is this is the pattern i use to
1132.32,4.08,identify cars as the final output for
1134.48,3.439,that neural network we looked at
1136.4,2.48,so when they talk about limited memory
1137.919,3.12,this is what they're talking about
1138.88,3.36,they're talking about i've created this
1141.039,3.681,based on all these things but i'm not
1142.24,4.72,going to remember anyone specifically
1144.72,4.24,theory of mind systems being able to
1146.96,3.92,understand human emotions and how they
1148.96,3.68,affect decision making to adjust their
1150.88,3.36,behaviors according to their human
1152.64,3.12,understanding
1154.24,3.52,this is important because this is our
1155.76,4.24,page mark this is how we know
1157.76,3.279,whether it is an artificial intelligence
1160.0,2.96,or not
1161.039,4.401,is it interacting with humans in a way
1162.96,4.64,that we can understand
1165.44,4.56,without that interaction
1167.6,4.56,is just an object so we talk about
1170.0,3.919,theory of mind we really understand how
1172.16,4.0,it interfaces that whole if you're in
1173.919,4.241,web development user experience would be
1176.16,3.84,the term i would put in there so the
1178.16,4.24,theory of mine would be user experience
1180.0,4.4,how's the whole ui connected together
1182.4,4.08,and one of the final things is as we get
1184.4,3.92,into artificial intelligence is systems
1186.48,4.16,being aware of themselves
1188.32,4.32,understanding their internal states and
1190.64,4.8,predicting other people's feelings and
1192.64,5.2,act appropriately so as artificial
1195.44,3.52,intelligence continues to progress
1197.84,3.12,we see ones that are trying to
1198.96,4.24,understand what makes people happy how
1200.96,3.76,would they increase our happiness
1203.2,2.96,how would they keep themselves from
1204.72,3.28,breaking down if something's broken
1206.16,4.8,inside they have that self-awareness to
1208.0,6.24,be able to fix it and just based on all
1210.96,5.2,that information predicting which action
1214.24,3.36,would work the best what would help
1216.16,3.2,people
1217.6,3.04,if i know that you're having a cup of
1219.36,3.6,coffee first thing in the morning is
1220.64,3.919,what makes you happy as a robot i might
1222.96,3.2,make you a cup of coffee every morning
1224.559,3.521,at the same time
1226.16,3.36,to help your life and help you grow
1228.08,3.92,that'd be the self-awareness is being
1229.52,3.92,able to know all those different things
1232.0,3.6,types of machine learning and like i
1233.44,4.4,said on the last slide this is very
1235.6,3.92,important this is very important if you
1237.84,4.16,decide to go in and get certified in
1239.52,5.039,machine learning or know more about it
1242.0,3.84,these are the three primary types of
1244.559,3.761,machine learning
1245.84,4.079,the first one is supervised learning
1248.32,5.2,systems are able to predict future
1249.919,5.521,outcome based on past data requires both
1253.52,4.24,an input and an output to be given to
1255.44,3.92,the model for it to be trained
1257.76,4.159,so in this case we're looking at
1259.36,3.92,anything where you have 100 images of a
1261.919,3.76,bicycle
1263.28,4.399,and those hundred images you know are
1265.679,3.281,bicycle so it's their presets someone
1267.679,3.441,already looked at all hundred images and
1268.96,3.92,said these are pictures of bicycles and
1271.12,4.24,so the computer learns from those and
1272.88,5.52,then it's given another picture
1275.36,4.88,and maybe the next picture is a bicycle
1278.4,3.92,and it says oh that resembles all these
1280.24,3.679,other bicycles so it's a bicycle and the
1282.32,2.719,next one's a car and it says that's not
1283.919,2.801,a bicycle
1285.039,3.201,that would be supervised learning
1286.72,3.92,because we had to train it we had to
1288.24,4.16,supervise it unsupervised learning
1290.64,4.24,systems are able to identify hidden
1292.4,4.24,patterns from the input data provided
1294.88,4.159,by making the data more readable and
1296.64,4.64,organized the patterns similarities or
1299.039,4.321,anomalies become more evident you'll
1301.28,3.68,heard the term cluster how do you
1303.36,3.679,cluster things together some of these
1304.96,3.599,things go together some of these don't
1307.039,2.721,this is unsupervised where you can look
1308.559,2.881,at an image
1309.76,3.12,and start pulling the different pieces
1311.44,4.16,of the image out
1312.88,4.159,because they aren't the same the human
1315.6,3.199,all the parts of the human are not the
1317.039,3.921,same as a fuzzy tree behind them just
1318.799,4.721,slightly out of focus which is not the
1320.96,3.68,same as the beach ball it's unsupervised
1323.52,2.399,because we never told it what a beach
1324.64,2.88,ball was we never told them what the
1325.919,2.961,human was and we never told it that
1327.52,3.12,those were trees
1328.88,4.799,all we told it was hey separate this
1330.64,4.56,picture by things that don't match
1333.679,2.721,and things that do match and come
1335.2,2.719,together
1336.4,3.84,and finally there's reinforcement
1337.919,4.24,learning systems are given no training
1340.24,3.84,it learns on the basis of the reward
1342.159,4.161,punishment it received for performing
1344.08,4.16,its last action it helps increase the
1346.32,4.239,efficiency of a tool function or a
1348.24,4.559,program reinforced learning a
1350.559,4.161,reinforcement learning is kind of you
1352.799,4.321,give it a yes or no yes you give me the
1354.72,4.48,right response no you didn't and then it
1357.12,4.08,looks at that and says oh okay so based
1359.2,4.16,on this data coming in
1361.2,4.4,what i gave you was a wrong response so
1363.36,4.0,next time i'll give you a different one
1365.6,3.439,comparing machine learning and deep
1367.36,4.08,learning so remember that deep learning
1369.039,4.241,is a subcategory of machine learning so
1371.44,3.76,it's one of the many tools
1373.28,3.68,and so they were grouping a ton of
1375.2,4.32,machine learning tools all together
1376.96,4.079,linear regression k means clustering
1379.52,3.92,there's all kinds of cool tools out
1381.039,4.561,there you can use in machine learning
1383.44,4.4,enables machines to take decisions to
1385.6,3.68,make decisions on their own based on
1387.84,3.52,past data
1389.28,4.48,enables machines to make decisions with
1391.36,4.08,the help of artificial neural networks
1393.76,3.6,so it's doing the same thing but we're
1395.44,3.359,using an artificial neural network as
1397.36,3.12,opposed to one of the more traditional
1398.799,3.441,machine learning tools
1400.48,3.92,needs only a small amount of training
1402.24,3.919,data this is very important when you're
1404.4,3.2,talking about machine learning
1406.159,3.041,they're usually not talking about huge
1407.6,2.959,amounts of data we're talking about
1409.2,3.2,maybe your spreadsheet from your
1410.559,3.36,business and your totals for the end of
1412.4,3.68,the year when you're talking about
1413.919,4.161,neural networks you usually need a large
1416.08,3.76,amount of data to train the data so
1418.08,4.56,there's a lot of training involved if
1419.84,3.68,you have under 500 points of data that's
1422.64,3.039,probably
1423.52,3.68,not going to go into machine learning or
1425.679,4.721,maybe you have like the case of one of
1427.2,5.44,the things 500 points of data and 30
1430.4,3.84,different fields it starts getting
1432.64,3.919,really confusing there in artificial
1434.24,4.24,intelligence or machine learning and the
1436.559,3.681,deep learning aspect really shines when
1438.48,3.76,you get to that larger data that's
1440.24,4.64,really complex
1442.24,4.319,works well on a low end systems
1444.88,3.52,so a lot of the machine learning tools
1446.559,4.401,out there you can run on your laptop
1448.4,3.68,with no problem and do the calculations
1450.96,2.88,there
1452.08,3.52,where with the machine learning usually
1453.84,3.68,needs a higher end system to work it
1455.6,4.4,takes a lot more processing power to
1457.52,4.639,build those neural networks and to train
1460.0,3.52,them it goes through a lot of data
1462.159,3.281,we're talking about the general machine
1463.52,4.0,learning tools most features need to be
1465.44,4.4,identified in advanced and manually
1467.52,4.48,coded so there's a lot of human work on
1469.84,4.56,here the machine learns the features
1472.0,4.72,from the data it is provided so again
1474.4,3.92,it's like a magic box you don't have to
1476.72,3.92,know what a tire is
1478.32,4.239,it figures it out for you
1480.64,4.639,the problem is divided into parts and
1482.559,4.081,solved individually and then combined so
1485.279,2.721,machine learning you usually have all
1486.64,3.36,these different tools and use different
1488.0,3.279,tools for different parts
1490.0,3.039,and the problem is solved in an
1491.279,4.241,end-to-end manner so you only have one
1493.039,4.321,neural network or two neural networks
1495.52,4.159,that is bringing the data in and putting
1497.36,4.64,it out it's not going through a lot of
1499.679,3.681,different processes to get there and
1502.0,3.12,remember you can put machine learning
1503.36,4.24,and deep learning together so you don't
1505.12,4.0,always have just the deep learning
1507.6,3.6,solving the problem by having selling
1509.12,4.0,one piece of the puzzle
1511.2,3.44,with regular machine learning and most
1513.12,3.679,machine learning tools out there they
1514.64,3.279,take longer to test and understand how
1516.799,2.561,they work
1517.919,3.281,and with the deep learning it's pretty
1519.36,4.08,quick once you build that neural network
1521.2,4.0,you test it and you know
1523.44,3.76,so we're dealing with very crisp rules
1525.2,3.52,limited resources
1527.2,3.2,you have to really explain how the
1528.72,3.68,decision was made when you use most
1530.4,3.44,machine learning tools but when you use
1532.4,2.879,the deep learning tool inside the
1533.84,3.439,machine learning tools
1535.279,3.921,the system takes care of it based on its
1537.279,3.681,own logic and reasoning and again it's
1539.2,3.68,like a magic black box
1540.96,3.599,you really don't know how it came up
1542.88,3.2,with the answer you just know it came up
1544.559,3.521,with the right answer
1546.08,4.0,a glimpse into the future
1548.08,4.32,so a quick glimpse into the future
1550.08,4.88,artificial intelligence using it to
1552.4,4.72,detecting crimes before they happen
1554.96,4.079,humanoid ai helpers which we already
1557.12,3.439,have a lot of there'll be more and more
1559.039,2.88,maybe it'll actually be androids that'd
1560.559,2.961,be cool to have an android that comes
1561.919,4.161,and gets stuff out of my fridge for me
1563.52,5.039,machine learning increasing efficiency
1566.08,4.32,in healthcare that's really big in all
1568.559,3.441,the forms of machine learning better
1570.4,3.12,marketing techniques
1572.0,3.2,any of these things
1573.52,3.68,if we get into the sciences it's just
1575.2,4.32,off the scale machine learning and
1577.2,4.8,artificial intelligence go everywhere
1579.52,3.32,and then the subcategory deep learning
1582.0,2.559,increased
1582.84,2.92,personalization so what's really nice
1584.559,4.0,about the deep learning is it's going to
1585.76,5.039,start now catering to you that'll be one
1588.559,3.441,of the things we see more and more of
1590.799,3.281,and we'll have more of a hyper
1592.0,3.76,intelligent personal assistant i'm
1594.08,3.04,excited about that
1595.76,3.2,what we have learned
1597.12,3.12,so far we covered artificial
1598.96,2.8,intelligence
1600.24,4.0,in this case the
1601.76,4.399,ai versus the human we did a lot of that
1604.24,3.039,so we have a page marker of human
1606.159,2.721,interaction
1607.279,3.28,we discussed machine learning and all
1608.88,4.0,their different parts and then we
1610.559,5.201,discussed the deep learning aspect
1612.88,4.08,we went into ai and machine learning and
1615.76,2.96,deep learning
1616.96,3.92,how they're all sub-categories of each
1618.72,4.16,other very important to remember that
1620.88,3.919,artificial intelligence is a big picture
1622.88,4.24,machine learning is a category in
1624.799,5.36,artificial intelligence and then deep
1627.12,4.72,learning is a tool in machine learning
1630.159,3.041,we talked of all the aspects in the
1631.84,3.36,machine learning and deep learning and
1633.2,3.359,how they compare and we took a quick
1635.2,2.959,glimpse into the future and all the
1636.559,3.12,different i'm sure you can come up with
1638.159,3.281,many more examples of where it's coming
1639.679,3.041,out in our future we looked at a few of
1641.44,3.04,them so you have some ideas of where
1642.72,3.12,this is going and all the different
1644.48,2.72,wonderful opportunities are going to
1645.84,3.439,come out with it
