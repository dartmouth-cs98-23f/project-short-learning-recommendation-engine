second,duration,transcript
0.24,4.92,so the environment that you see you know
2.7,5.159,is a work from notebook so in this
5.16,4.92,notebook you can type text you can have
7.859,3.78,like you know your coding move from
10.08,3.36,language you can have you know
11.639,3.96,visualization literally we can have
13.44,5.46,everything so it's an integrated
15.599,4.621,environment uh so first thing is that
18.9,3.18,like you know as you may know like you
20.22,4.979,know well for Mathematica it has more
22.08,5.279,than you know 6 000 building you know uh
25.199,4.261,functionalities each of those
27.359,4.861,functionalities there are for a specific
29.46,4.98,core area I don't know calculus you know
32.22,4.44,algebra like you know machine learning
34.44,4.38,and then like you know very recently
36.66,3.719,since last year like you know we have
38.82,5.399,been working on like you know developing
40.379,6.541,a collection of functions for doing any
44.219,4.441,sort of quantum computation in a finer
46.92,3.78,dimensional space
48.66,3.719,so one more time like you know it's any
50.7,4.379,Quantum computation in the final
52.379,4.801,dimensional you know Hillary space and
55.079,4.861,what we call it is basically is a
57.18,4.019,packlet so packlet is basically like you
59.94,3.24,know a collection of functionalities
61.199,3.481,that are you know interconnected and
63.18,3.36,after installing the packlet you can
64.68,3.24,have access to all of those functions so
66.54,3.119,first is the block you know you just
67.92,5.04,need to evaluate like you know this code
69.659,6.0,to get what we call as well from Quantum
72.96,4.86,framework and as of now like you know
75.659,5.341,these are the list of
77.82,5.76,functionalities that we have supporting
81.0,4.259,any Quantum computation the beauty of
83.58,3.66,like you know having packlet is that
85.259,3.661,like you know they're very similar to
87.24,3.48,any other function that you have
88.92,4.559,involved for Mathematica like you know
90.72,5.039,you see here like you know if you click
93.479,4.441,you know on that you would see like you
95.759,3.961,know the documentation page so each of
97.92,4.379,you know these functionalities they have
99.72,4.259,their own documentation page and like
102.299,3.601,any other documentation like you know
103.979,3.901,the format is the same like you know
105.9,3.42,basic examples it's called properties
107.88,4.86,and like you know you can find you know
109.32,6.18,other you know for example I don't know
112.74,5.159,this is the list of you know functions
115.5,5.399,that we have you see like you know basis
117.899,5.641,objects you know uh manipulation of that
120.899,4.68,entanglement circuit so that that that's
123.54,3.66,the collection that we have so like you
125.579,3.6,know after installing the packlet like
127.2,4.56,you know it's like you have those you
129.179,4.681,know 20 something like you know Quantum
131.76,3.3,functionalities with the corresponding
133.86,3.0,documentation
135.06,4.2,um we did our best to have a
136.86,4.26,documentation with no issue but they
139.26,3.3,might be you know some some minor issues
141.12,4.38,like you know if you spotted anything
142.56,3.6,please let us know and we would correct
145.5,2.879,that
146.16,4.14,uh it's like you know the main purpose
148.379,4.141,of this session is having an
150.3,3.6,introduction to to Quantum Computing
152.52,3.96,using our framework so I'm going to
153.9,5.22,start with something very basic at the
156.48,5.339,very fundamental level the way that we
159.12,4.64,deal with many of any Quantum
161.819,4.981,computation is like this
163.76,4.42,within some process whatever that
166.8,2.82,process like you know we are going to
168.18,3.54,discuss about that very soon but you
169.62,4.38,know within a process what we do is you
171.72,3.72,know at the very end we prepare a
174.0,3.66,Quantum estate
175.44,5.76,and that Quantum estate is installed
177.66,5.52,like you know in uh one or many uh
181.2,6.24,physical systems
183.18,6.839,uh in quantum theory the simplest
187.44,4.56,system that we have is a system of you
190.019,3.36,know Dimension two basically that's a
192.0,4.2,system that like you know in the
193.379,5.28,simplest case you can describe it by a
196.2,4.259,vector of two with two amplitudes and
198.659,3.36,those amplitudes they can get like you
200.459,3.721,know complex numbers they can be pure
202.019,3.421,they can be complex but what you see
204.18,2.82,here like you know let's say that you
205.44,2.82,know something happened and at the end
207.0,5.4,like you know you prepare like you know
208.26,5.94,this Quantum mistake okay uh Quantum
212.4,3.419,estate like after evaluating that like
214.2,4.44,you know Quantum is stating a framework
215.819,4.741,like you know it's an object and this is
218.64,4.319,basically the like you know the summary
220.56,3.84,box you know for that object don't be
222.959,3.661,scared of you know the summary box like
224.4,4.74,you know if you want like you know you
226.62,5.399,can look at the traditional form on Mac
229.14,4.2,the short key is command shift T so you
232.019,3.78,know that's basically the broadcast
233.34,5.28,notation the traditional form
235.799,5.281,okay so I'm using like you know uh the
238.62,4.5,the short key or you can simply like you
241.08,3.84,know uh wrap it around you know
243.12,3.6,traditional form and you can see it like
244.92,4.739,that short key was literally like an
246.72,4.379,applying this function on that stick the
249.659,2.761,beauty of like you know this object is
251.099,3.06,that you know they contain lots of
252.42,4.02,interesting information that it can help
254.159,3.841,you to get like you know uh to have an
256.44,3.84,idea like you know what you're doing but
258.0,4.38,you know what is the picture uh What is
260.28,5.52,this state it's a pure State format and
262.38,5.4,trophies you know uh zero it's one
265.8,4.56,physical system the number of Q This
267.78,4.8,Dimension etc etc but anyhow like you
270.36,4.92,know let's focus on the on the big
272.58,5.22,picture so uh
275.28,4.44,a physical process happen like you know
277.8,3.959,we prepare a Quantum State and then the
279.72,4.02,next step that we do is we do
281.759,3.841,measurement remember like you know in
283.74,3.6,quantum theory measurement is very
285.6,3.42,different from any other transformation
287.34,3.96,so like you know whatever transformation
289.02,5.64,whatever process that is happening on
291.3,6.54,Quantum system measurement is different
294.66,5.039,so what I'm doing here and think about
297.84,3.66,it like you know very similar to like
299.699,4.44,other functionalities that we have in
301.5,5.88,both of Mathematica a function
304.139,6.721,it acts on another function and then and
307.38,6.72,the results is an outcome so here like
310.86,5.76,you know our Quantum measurement acts on
314.1,4.56,basically this is the input for this
316.62,4.019,function I'm saying that we're going to
318.66,4.319,measure it in you know computational
320.639,3.84,basis or some details like you know for
322.979,4.081,example if you do not know like you know
324.479,4.141,how to do that like just just look at
327.06,3.18,the documentation so this is the
328.62,3.48,documentation and like you know it
330.24,3.42,contains all the information that you
332.1,3.659,need regarding that function but anyhow
333.66,3.66,let's again let you know let me just
335.759,3.66,briefly review and then I'm going to go
337.32,4.02,into the detail so
339.419,3.961,a state is prepared and then at the end
341.34,5.1,you do a measurement
343.38,4.56,uh in our framework because like you
346.44,3.3,know we have all other functionalities
347.94,2.819,involved for mathematical you can
349.74,2.76,calculate the corresponding
350.759,3.481,probabilities remember quantum theory
352.5,4.02,the best description at the end is
354.24,3.899,giving you which what probability you
356.52,3.42,can get the corresponding outcome and
358.139,4.321,this is what we get out of log you know
359.94,4.259,this spatial state
362.46,4.38,okay so like you know that's basically
364.199,4.981,the bar chart of like you know uh that
366.84,3.84,measurement that's not what is happening
369.18,3.54,in practice
370.68,5.06,because these probabilities like you
372.72,3.02,know well for Mathematica
375.78,4.32,it calculates them exactly meaning
378.3,3.48,because you know we have you know
380.1,3.599,statistic probability functionality
381.78,4.5,these are the exact numbers
383.699,4.5,in reality like you know in experiment
386.28,4.38,just let me show you like you know a
388.199,5.041,special case that I have simulated an
390.66,4.92,experiment you have to basically repeat
393.24,4.92,the ex the measurement and you would get
395.58,3.959,a collection of results okay so in this
398.16,2.94,very special case you know what I'm
399.539,3.301,doing here I'm simulating you know the
401.1,3.78,measurement results and I'm saying that
402.84,3.96,you know do it you know too many times
404.88,3.96,okay and this is basically you know what
406.8,3.899,I'm getting here and then like you know
408.84,3.84,out of that you can you know calculate
410.699,4.56,the corresponding frequencies so what
412.68,4.32,I'm doing here is I'm just let me just
415.259,4.081,show you this text of the cell right now
417.0,3.96,okay count them the result is an
419.34,4.199,association it says like you know for
420.96,4.5,one you know you got 18 results for zero
423.539,3.961,you got two results and then the next
425.46,4.26,step I'm just telling you know normalize
427.5,4.08,that based on like you know let me just
429.72,3.0,use you know this syntax which means
431.58,3.0,like you know check this you know
432.72,3.96,outcome here I'm just saying I'm going
434.58,3.42,to normalize by total you know because I
436.68,3.419,want to get you know the probabilities
438.0,4.68,it's just like you know how to get the
440.099,5.16,probabilities this is basically you know
442.68,4.62,the frequency that we get this is this
445.259,3.481,is what happens in experiment of course
447.3,3.66,like you know in reality there are noise
448.74,3.48,and many other complexities but anyhow
450.96,3.42,like you know that's what you would get
452.22,4.02,and you can look you know compare them
454.38,4.439,together you know easily but
456.24,4.62,uh the the orange one is like you know
458.819,5.401,the exact like you know that's exact
460.86,7.26,calculation and the blue one is what you
464.22,5.58,get out of the experiment uh
468.12,3.419,please note that like you know because
469.8,3.54,again you know in Wolfram language we
471.539,3.241,can have you know symbolic calculation
473.34,4.68,and again you know all of those
474.78,5.639,statistics and uh uh probability
478.02,4.44,functionalities the results that we
480.419,3.421,calculate I know like you know I refer
482.46,2.88,to them as a sort of log you know
483.84,3.24,simulation but they are exact as well
485.34,5.28,again on purpose I put it like you know
487.08,5.399,as exact and uh this is a very unique
490.62,3.299,feature about our framework but you know
492.479,3.241,if you want to reproduce like another
493.919,3.9,measurement results in other you know
495.72,3.72,Quantum Frameworks the best they would
497.819,4.32,do is they run it you know a couple of
499.44,4.259,times I don't know 1024 times and they
502.139,3.481,just tell you like you know what counts
503.699,4.62,for each measurement
505.62,5.699,uh this is the core idea of like you
508.319,6.361,know any Quantum computing
511.319,6.001,that that's it okay like you know it's
514.68,5.219,prepare a very particular State and do a
517.32,4.62,measurement and for the measurements you
519.899,4.681,know at the experimental level we get
521.94,5.04,like you know a collection of results
524.58,4.02,and then based on that you know we want
526.98,3.78,to do a very particular you know
528.6,3.72,computation
530.76,4.079,that that's it
532.32,4.62,uh the biggest headache is usually like
534.839,4.44,you know how to prepare a very
536.94,3.839,particular state that is suitable for a
539.279,4.381,very particular goal for a very
540.779,6.421,particular like you know uh objective
543.66,5.34,that we have and how to prepare that
547.2,4.38,okay so that's the whole idea of like
549.0,5.76,you know developing a Quantum algorithm
551.58,5.759,for a very particular purpose okay but
554.76,4.32,let me just comment a little bit more
557.339,3.421,about like you know Quantum measurement
559.08,4.14,because you know remember that you know
560.76,6.18,in quantum theory you can do Quantum
563.22,5.76,measurement in many possible ways for
566.94,4.32,example the previous example that I
568.98,4.38,showed you was let's say like you know
571.26,3.54,pretending that this is a simulation of
573.36,3.78,an actual like you know Quantum
574.8,5.159,Processing Unit it was in computational
577.14,5.28,basis zero and one you can change that
579.959,3.961,basis you can do it for example in poly
582.42,3.66,X and you would get you know the
583.92,4.8,corresponding probabilities so these are
586.08,5.04,the results in poly X and this is the
588.72,5.22,result like you know in uh
591.12,4.86,uh for like you know computational basis
593.94,4.62,so that for that measurement you have
595.98,4.68,lots of freedom okay so that's a big
598.56,3.839,picture a Quantum estate you do a
600.66,3.0,measurement and for a measurement like
602.399,3.181,you know the best is like you know you
603.66,4.679,can calculate some you know frequencies
605.58,4.5,and then you have to ask okay what what
608.339,4.321,I can learn out of those frequencies
610.08,3.9,okay what kind of you know operation uh
612.66,5.54,I can do with that
613.98,8.22,uh so first what what Quantum estate
618.2,5.38,given like you know any initial State
622.2,3.6,like you know let's say that you know
623.58,4.14,you you prepare your system in a
625.8,4.56,particular State and then you want to
627.72,4.5,transform that state in quantum theory
630.36,4.68,this transformation can be done in many
632.22,5.64,different ways okay for example like you
635.04,4.739,know one possible way is doing it in a
637.86,4.02,unitary way this is what we usually have
639.779,3.961,as Quantum operator and quantum theory
641.88,3.899,so what I'm doing here I'm just saying
643.74,4.38,that you know okay prepare a very
645.779,4.861,particular State and then apply like you
648.12,4.32,know poly X poly X you know in two
650.64,3.3,Dimension is you know it's still you
652.44,4.44,know literally the same like you know
653.94,4.5,not uh operator and of course I'm sure
656.88,3.36,you guys know that like you know you go
658.44,4.26,from zero to one
660.24,4.8,so this is the transformation like you
662.7,4.079,know I'm showing you the the simplest
665.04,4.799,case but like you know then the next
666.779,4.081,step for any Quantum algorithm is what
669.839,2.641,is the collection of you know
670.86,4.44,transformation for a very particular
672.48,5.28,objective what what we can do like you
675.3,4.32,know uh how we can compose a very
677.76,4.38,particular you know transformation
679.62,5.04,so let me focus on like you know the
682.14,5.16,idea of like you know uh transformation
684.66,6.179,like you know how I can change this
687.3,5.52,state uh just like you know a common
690.839,3.361,terminology that we have in quantum
692.82,3.18,theory because again like you know the
694.2,5.639,most popular you know Quantum systems or
696.0,6.3,Quantum system in two Dimension but you
699.839,4.261,know a spin half system uh for example
702.3,3.3,let me show you like you know a case
704.1,4.2,that I'm preparing like you know a
705.6,5.4,random pure State and I'm just looking
708.3,6.42,at the amplitudes okay so this is
711.0,6.12,literally like you know uh uh for this
714.72,3.96,basis you know this is the amplitude and
717.12,3.12,that's the other one this is basically
718.68,4.08,the same like for example in our
720.24,5.279,framework the
722.76,4.319,another term that we have for that is a
725.519,3.181,state Vector but you see like you know
727.079,4.141,behind the scene you know for us as
728.7,4.259,state Vector is a sports array and if
731.22,3.179,you want to see like another actual form
732.959,4.681,just like you know look at the normal
734.399,4.44,okay so that that's what you get uh of
737.64,3.24,course you know when you're you know
738.839,4.021,looking at this state you know Vector
740.88,4.5,remember like you know the order like
742.86,5.539,you know this amplitude corresponds to
745.38,5.639,what you know uh element of your basis
748.399,4.0,either you know if you don't know that
751.019,3.121,for example look at the amplitude
752.399,3.541,because you know it shows you like you
754.14,3.78,know the keys here are basically like
755.94,3.899,you know the element of the quantum
757.92,3.599,basis that you're using but anyhow like
759.839,3.721,you know so for the simplest Quantum
761.519,5.82,system you know we can describe it by a
763.56,6.18,vector a vector of two elements that can
767.339,5.041,be like you know complex another way of
769.74,4.38,you know representing that is by a
772.38,4.139,vector in three dimension and this is
774.12,5.82,what we usually call as a block vector
776.519,5.041,uh each of these objects each of these
779.94,4.019,objects that we have in our framework
781.56,4.62,they have a long list of properties that
783.959,4.801,you can find you know in our
786.18,5.339,documentation page like you know oops I
788.76,4.44,went to the documentation for
791.519,3.661,let me just show you the documentation
793.2,4.259,page here and if you click on the
795.18,4.98,details like you know there is an
797.459,4.741,explanation here like for example here
800.16,4.799,in a block spherical coordinate you know
802.2,4.5,coordinates of computed block Cartesian
804.959,4.801,like you know so it gives you the
806.7,4.8,Cartesian coordinates so this is
809.76,3.36,basically Cartesian coordinate and this
811.5,4.74,is you know the spherical coordinate of
813.12,4.56,you know R Theta and Phi uh this is
816.24,3.839,basically the three-dimensional you know
817.68,6.3,visualization so you have a sphere and
820.079,6.681,like you know this Vector represents the
823.98,5.46,same state as what we have here
826.76,3.879,this representation is very popular like
829.44,3.78,you know those of you if you want to
830.639,4.621,work like you know in in this field you
833.22,4.739,need to know more about like you know uh
835.26,5.22,blocker sphere because uh this is one of
837.959,4.201,those knowledge like many times many
840.48,3.24,want to describe anything we refer to
842.16,4.919,the you know block vector and what
843.72,6.059,happens to that okay
847.079,4.681,let us focus on a very simple case okay
849.779,3.36,so what I'm doing here is that plugin
851.76,4.62,I'm preparing like you know important
853.139,4.981,state in a zero State I guess you
856.38,3.3,already noticed like you know I haven't
858.12,2.94,mentioned that but look at here like you
859.68,4.32,know the quantum estate is taking a
861.06,5.279,string as an input so this is exactly
864.0,4.079,the same as
866.339,4.021,doing it
868.079,4.081,as a vector when the first element is
870.36,4.32,one
872.16,3.9,so in the second element is Z1 so this
874.68,4.08,is by definition that's how we Define
876.06,4.44,log you know zero State and as you
878.76,3.18,notice like you know all other
880.5,3.06,functionalities that you have in in
881.94,3.42,Wolfram language like you know you can
883.56,3.66,apply it on the on the top of you know
885.36,4.14,Quantum objects but anyhow let us
887.22,3.9,continue like you know with our story so
889.5,3.42,what I'm doing here I'm just doing you
891.12,4.38,know a simple transformation I'm saying
892.92,4.919,that like you know this function
895.5,5.699,which is a rotation with a given you
897.839,5.041,know a vector is acting on that initial
901.199,3.901,State and that initial state is
902.88,5.759,basically or zero State and then I'm
905.1,4.979,looking at the Block plot of that state
908.639,4.021,we can just you know wrap it by
910.079,4.44,manipulator and you see here like you
912.66,4.979,know it is clear like you know it's the
914.519,5.581,rotation around the y-axis that that we
917.639,5.181,have here by corresponding you know
920.1,2.72,angle Theta
922.98,3.719,okay so it's just a simple
925.5,4.139,transformation
926.699,4.861,now let me make a composition of like
929.639,3.921,you know these operations in two steps
931.56,5.82,I'm gonna say like you know first step
933.56,5.32,I'm gonna apply rotation and you see
937.38,3.899,here like you know the notation that I'm
938.88,4.62,using here is a functional notation here
941.279,3.661,I'm just using the prefix notation okay
943.5,3.0,it's just like you know different
944.94,3.6,syntaxes that we have involved form
946.5,3.42,language but anyhow what I'm doing here
948.54,3.419,I'm just saying that you know first
949.92,3.719,applied rotation around y by the
951.959,4.141,corresponding angle Theta on this
953.639,4.621,initial State and on the result apply
956.1,3.9,rotation around C
958.26,3.24,and as you can see like you know for
960.0,4.139,example you know this is the rotation at
961.5,3.899,all y-axis and now a rotation around you
964.139,4.341,know z-axis
965.399,5.221,we can go from a final state
968.48,4.12,different we can go from an initial
970.62,4.38,state to a final state
972.6,4.62,so the idea of like you know a
975.0,4.079,composition like you know this is what
977.22,5.76,we usually call as a composition like
979.079,6.901,you know two transformation apply on a
982.98,5.159,particular State this is basically the
985.98,3.419,very fundamental idea of like you know a
988.139,3.361,circuit
989.399,4.74,so whenever we talk about the circuit a
991.5,5.6,circuit is literally like you know a
994.139,5.64,collection of like you know uh different
997.1,5.32,operations and those operations like you
999.779,4.92,know I'm on purpose I'm saying operation
1002.42,4.62,in the most generic term because they
1004.699,4.32,can be even non-unitary non-trace
1007.04,4.14,preserved they can be anything it can be
1009.019,4.081,a noise it can be you know stochastic it
1011.18,3.36,can be a Quantum Channel it can be
1013.1,3.539,literally anything but here you know I'm
1014.54,4.979,just considering the the a very simple
1016.639,5.94,case like exactly the previous situation
1019.519,5.761,that first rotation around y then
1022.579,7.561,rotation around the C now this is
1025.28,7.919,basically in language of uh circuits
1030.14,4.86,uh the the most common thing about the
1033.199,3.48,quantum circuit is you know the
1035.0,4.14,corresponding visualization which is
1036.679,4.681,what you see here each vertical wire
1039.14,4.799,each horizontal wire it represents the
1041.36,4.319,quantum State and each of these boxes is
1043.939,4.081,basically your transformation and here
1045.679,5.281,we should read from left to right okay
1048.02,6.12,so it means this guy here you know
1050.96,5.4,rotation around why it acts first and
1054.14,4.38,after that Z
1056.36,3.9,so remember like you know I'm writing it
1058.52,3.72,here like you know left to right and
1060.26,3.48,that that's the very first operation
1062.24,4.08,that is happening
1063.74,4.08,uh there are some like you know the way
1066.32,4.739,that you can
1067.82,5.099,build your circuit I'm gonna show you
1071.059,3.901,you know some complicated examples but
1072.919,4.461,anyhow like you know either you can
1074.96,5.459,literally the way that I'm doing it here
1077.38,4.72,include your objects but you see here
1080.419,3.301,like you know somebody would say ah look
1082.1,3.42,you know this is redundant I'm just
1083.72,3.9,repeating you know Quantum operator can
1085.52,4.26,I get rid of that oh yeah of course you
1087.62,4.74,know you can do that you know we also
1089.78,4.259,support like you know those uh shorthand
1092.36,3.9,notations so basically literally like
1094.039,3.961,you know whenever you have Quantum
1096.26,2.76,operator wrapped around that you know
1098.0,3.84,you can just
1099.02,5.46,remove that and that that maybe helps
1101.84,4.32,with writing the code or reading that so
1104.48,4.02,it's like you know basically rotation
1106.16,4.139,around y by corresponding you know angle
1108.5,3.419,rotation around Z by the corresponding
1110.299,3.181,and your line you can easily again like
1111.919,3.0,you know
1113.48,5.04,check that you know they are the same
1114.919,5.161,these two are the same thing uh one very
1118.52,3.42,important feature of like in a Wolfram
1120.08,3.78,language is that you can do symbolic
1121.94,3.84,computation as you can see here you know
1123.86,4.74,this circuit is a symbolic circuit I'm
1125.78,5.34,not assigning any value to parameter you
1128.6,4.92,know Theta and Phi okay there are
1131.12,5.4,literally like like a symbol and you can
1133.52,6.18,what you can do is you can say okay uh
1136.52,4.44,this circuit now I want it to act on an
1139.7,3.0,initial estate
1140.96,3.3,so the way that you can do it is just
1142.7,3.479,like you know active like you know that
1144.26,4.14,second I call it you know Crump and you
1146.179,4.981,know it can act on any Quantum mistake
1148.4,4.76,whatever is that Quantum State okay for
1151.16,4.68,example this this is a state
1153.16,5.2,representing in a one qubit so it can go
1155.84,4.62,even with the random queue or like you
1158.36,7.559,know whatever state you like
1160.46,7.74,many times we prepare all of our Q bits
1165.919,5.221,in the ground state meaning all of them
1168.2,5.339,are in the zero State because that's the
1171.14,4.32,most common way of like you know dealing
1173.539,5.461,with you know Quantum systems in Quantum
1175.46,5.839,Computing one shorthand notation is just
1179.0,4.62,don't give any input
1181.299,4.361,whenever you are not giving any input
1183.62,4.26,behind the scene what we do is we are
1185.66,4.68,going to set whatever Quantum system
1187.88,5.1,that you have all of them at the ground
1190.34,4.56,state zero okay so like you know
1192.98,4.439,basically this operation that you see
1194.9,4.38,here Quantum state zero and then like
1197.419,3.901,you know this circuit acting on that is
1199.28,3.96,the same as this operation but
1201.32,3.42,anyhowload you know this is a
1203.24,3.66,transformation like you know a
1204.74,3.72,transformation of the state and then you
1206.9,3.18,can look at like you know the amplitude
1208.46,3.78,and these all the amplitudes that that
1210.08,3.839,we got as you can see here these
1212.24,3.059,amplitudes are still you know in the
1213.919,4.441,symbolic form
1215.299,4.861,okay this is one important thing that
1218.36,5.22,you remember about you know both of
1220.16,6.36,language uh it has a very you know
1223.58,4.74,strong feature maybe the characteristic
1226.52,3.84,trait of like in a Wolfram language is
1228.32,6.54,that you can do symbolic calculation
1230.36,6.179,okay now so let's let's jump like let me
1234.86,3.72,give you more information about like you
1236.539,4.081,know okay this composition of operation
1238.58,4.339,which is basically the wrapper around
1240.62,5.16,them is our Quantum circuit operator
1242.919,5.14,you can do whatever you want let's try
1245.78,4.139,to read it like so here I'm just saying
1248.059,5.101,that you know poly X
1249.919,5.341,poly Y and then rotation around X by the
1253.16,4.5,angular Theta this is basically the
1255.26,4.38,collection of like you know Gates that
1257.66,3.18,we have like you know like that's how we
1259.64,3.12,would call them you know in Quantum
1260.84,4.94,Computing and all of them are acting on
1262.76,5.64,the same wire on the same Quantum system
1265.78,5.38,uh very interesting feature that we have
1268.4,4.98,in our framework is called order so you
1271.16,4.92,can say you can specify a various
1273.38,4.919,specific order you can say look uh I
1276.08,4.74,want you know this rotation to act on
1278.299,4.62,the second quantum system
1280.82,4.02,okay so that's how you would do it you
1282.919,3.481,would just you know uh specify a rule
1284.84,3.839,and this one would say okay this
1286.4,3.659,rotation goes to the second system and
1288.679,2.641,if you look at like you know again like
1290.059,3.24,you know what I'm doing here I'm just
1291.32,4.92,using the shortcut for traditional form
1293.299,5.641,but you know on Mac is command shift t
1296.24,5.939,and as you can see here like you know so
1298.94,4.8,X is on the first after that y on the
1302.179,4.441,first qubit and then look you know you
1303.74,6.179,have rotation on the second one remember
1306.62,5.039,like you know unless these commute like
1309.919,3.361,you know the order that you are writing
1311.659,3.301,them like you know it's very important
1313.28,2.82,so that's the rule of thumb like you
1314.96,2.88,know those of you who are new to this
1316.1,3.3,field remember like you know the order
1317.84,3.839,that you're writing all those operations
1319.4,4.139,are very important
1321.679,3.301,or another example like you know look at
1323.539,3.721,you know this example what I'm doing
1324.98,4.62,here I'm just saying that you know okay
1327.26,5.58,you know this time like you know I would
1329.6,5.04,like you know uh Hollywood to act on the
1332.84,3.959,third qubit so this time you're gonna
1334.64,4.62,have you know three wires for the first
1336.799,4.74,one we have like you know poly X second
1339.26,4.08,one rotation around X and the last one
1341.539,3.781,is what
1343.34,5.699,so that's how like you know we can you
1345.32,5.76,know uh build you know a composition of
1349.039,5.221,different you know Gates different you
1351.08,5.88,know transformation for uh our Quantum
1354.26,4.32,systems of course the examples that I
1356.96,3.66,have shown you so far like you know all
1358.58,4.32,these examples as you as you see like
1360.62,4.86,you know each of these Transformations
1362.9,4.44,they are acting on a single qubit you
1365.48,3.179,can have you know more complicated cases
1367.34,3.959,like you know for example like you know
1368.659,6.0,this is a fancy control gate which is
1371.299,5.821,acting simultaneously on four quantum
1374.659,4.861,systems at the same time basically you
1377.12,4.679,cannot decompose it into a you know a
1379.52,4.92,Chronicle product of like you know four
1381.799,4.681,different operations okay it's acting on
1384.44,4.859,that whole you know space at the same
1386.48,4.98,time okay so your Gates your
1389.299,4.801,transformation they can act on a single
1391.46,4.68,they can act on many of them two or more
1394.1,4.26,at the same time and again like you know
1396.14,3.96,look what I'm doing here I'm just going
1398.36,4.74,with the control and then I'm saying
1400.1,5.1,that you know the operation is X this is
1403.1,3.78,control one so I'm just saying that like
1405.2,3.08,you know number one and number two if
1406.88,4.14,they are one
1408.28,5.62,acted and then this is basically control
1411.02,4.56,zero so like you know these are like you
1413.9,5.1,know the uh
1415.58,5.52,uh Arguments for our control gate and
1419.0,3.72,again like you know if you don't know
1421.1,3.36,how to use like you know these
1422.72,4.8,functionalities just just look at our
1424.46,5.04,documentation uh it has many examples
1427.52,3.659,and each of these named you know
1429.5,3.96,operations like you know they are
1431.179,3.781,explained here in detail
1433.46,3.18,whenever you are looking into the
1434.96,4.32,documentation especially for circuit
1436.64,4.5,operator please remember that many of
1439.28,3.96,the things that you see here there are
1441.14,3.24,actually Quantum operators so if you go
1443.24,2.88,here
1444.38,3.659,let me show it one more time and under
1446.12,4.98,the details you didn't see any
1448.039,6.481,description of the control operation it
1451.1,7.02,means it is under the documentation for
1454.52,6.48,uh Quantum operator or something just go
1458.12,4.86,it's a long documentation so if we click
1461.0,4.86,on Quantum operator
1462.98,4.98,and here like you know you would see it
1465.86,3.9,like you know all these you know all of
1467.96,4.14,them are collection of you know control
1469.76,4.44,Gates that we have here so we can find
1472.1,4.38,like you know the detail here
1474.2,3.12,okay so that's that's the one that I was
1476.48,2.88,using
1477.32,3.96,and each of log you know these
1479.36,3.72,operations they have a full name or they
1481.28,3.96,have a short name like you know you can
1483.08,3.54,use either one
1485.24,4.02,uh
1486.62,4.919,now let me just give you like a very
1489.26,6.6,specific example regarding like you know
1491.539,6.541,what we usually call as a a Quantum
1495.86,3.12,algorithm for a very particular you know
1498.08,2.94,go
1498.98,3.78,I use you know a textbook example which
1501.02,6.06,is you know Grover Quantum search
1502.76,5.64,algorithm okay so the idea is like this
1507.08,3.0,let's say that like now we have this
1508.4,4.62,Boolean function which is a simple look
1510.08,5.579,you know the the like you know and and
1513.02,4.08,then not on the second one using like
1515.659,3.481,you know the other building
1517.1,3.84,functionalities in more for Mathematica
1519.14,3.36,you can easily find like you know what
1520.94,3.3,are the solutions of this Boolean
1522.5,4.559,function is it trivial case it is clear
1524.24,4.26,living room if q1 is true Q2 is false
1527.059,3.421,like you know you will get like you know
1528.5,5.52,that that's a solution you will get a
1530.48,5.84,true value for f okay now let's let's
1534.02,4.68,what is the a
1536.32,6.219,Quantum process
1538.7,7.44,for finding you know this solution
1542.539,5.88,okay so that Quantum process is going to
1546.14,4.5,be like this you would start by
1548.419,4.081,preparing your physical states in the
1550.64,4.56,ground state you would apply some
1552.5,4.559,Transformations and then you would do a
1555.2,4.68,measurement
1557.059,4.86,remember all of those Transformations at
1559.88,4.2,the end of the day they prepare a very
1561.919,4.681,particular Quantum state
1564.08,5.4,so any Quantum algorithm is like
1566.6,4.319,a very specific Quantum estate followed
1569.48,2.76,by the measurement remember like you
1570.919,3.541,know measurement that's the only way
1572.24,4.319,that we can extract information out of
1574.46,4.8,log in our Quantum system
1576.559,4.081,uh for this very particular case well
1579.26,2.76,you know I guess you already noticed
1580.64,4.32,when I was showing you the documentation
1582.02,7.44,for Quantum circuit operator we have a
1584.96,6.959,long list of you know uh name operators
1589.46,4.74,name circuits
1591.919,5.461,so these are like you know very common
1594.2,5.94,circuits that that we have for a very
1597.38,4.679,particular like you know algorithm and
1600.14,3.96,uh
1602.059,3.6,let me focus on again as I told you like
1604.1,5.579,that's a textbook example Global
1605.659,5.821,Research algorithm uh log uh maybe it's
1609.679,3.6,early if I just show it to you that like
1611.48,4.439,you know we have all the completions so
1613.279,4.441,when you just type it like you know it
1615.919,3.961,shows you you know completely stuff like
1617.72,4.8,you know name operators that name
1619.88,5.34,circuits that we have I don't like
1622.52,4.56,let's just look at the magic wand for
1625.22,4.319,preparing like you know Bella State and
1627.08,3.66,that that that's what we have here by
1629.539,2.64,they were like you know all these
1630.74,2.64,features like you know this gray box
1632.179,3.421,like you know that particular
1633.38,4.38,composition that you may not like it to
1635.6,4.62,see it on the top block you know all of
1637.76,6.48,them look you know you can easily uh
1640.22,6.36,customize them using uh our uh label
1644.24,5.28,functionalities and
1646.58,4.26,just find it for second diagram it's
1649.52,3.48,here you see like you know what I did
1650.84,3.719,was you know just I just search through
1653.0,4.26,the documentation and that's the diagram
1654.559,4.921,for you know Quantum framework and these
1657.26,5.58,are all the details all the options that
1659.48,5.04,we have for uh circuit visualization I
1662.84,3.3,know like you know many of our users are
1664.52,5.279,using you know Wolfram language for
1666.14,6.539,visualizations so like you know we have
1669.799,4.561,lots of options you can do a lot but but
1672.679,5.581,anyhow let's let's
1674.36,5.64,let's move on so the input the argument
1678.26,3.0,here is basically that Boolean function
1680.0,3.179,I'm just saying you know look you know
1681.26,4.26,I'm looking for Grover uh search
1683.179,3.901,algorithm uh this is the Boolean
1685.52,3.3,function and this is a circuit diagram
1687.08,3.66,that we have
1688.82,3.599,the first you know step like you know
1690.74,3.0,the one log analysis inside the gray
1692.419,6.601,boxer you know for Grover search
1693.74,5.28,algorithm which is usually called uh uh
1702.159,5.201,diffusion step for a second I I forgot
1705.32,4.8,about the terminology and the second
1707.36,5.16,piece that you see here is amplification
1710.12,5.46,so what's what's happening here like you
1712.52,5.039,know is uh practice each of them let's
1715.58,5.16,say that you know you are
1717.559,8.22,interested in uh
1720.74,7.939,just looking at the grover diffusion and
1725.779,2.9,uh
1736.159,2.541,oh
1738.74,6.36,yes so I'm you know this will be
1741.98,5.699,functional very soon let me just make it
1745.1,4.8,another note of that
1747.679,4.38,I'll fix it very soon
1749.9,8.34,but anyhow you know each of these pieces
1752.059,6.181,let me also check if we have uh
1762.86,3.0,oh
1768.7,5.8,see is it the same case for phase
1771.98,5.299,diffusion
1774.5,2.779,oh
1782.38,7.36,okay I have broken that so I'll I'll fix
1786.86,4.5,it in a sec uh each of these pieces
1789.74,3.539,basically login and can extract it you
1791.36,4.5,see like you know the name operates was
1793.279,4.38,never there but let's continue so what's
1795.86,5.64,happening here is that you know during
1797.659,5.64,the first step the the gray box we are
1801.5,4.38,saving the information about the
1803.299,6.12,solution in an ancillary qubit and then
1805.88,7.019,in the second step we amplify the
1809.419,6.181,basically the amplitude of that uh that
1812.899,6.721,very particular uh solution
1815.6,6.6,okay uh the global search algorithm well
1819.62,4.5,you know remember login it has two uh
1822.2,5.459,features this is the one which is based
1824.12,6.6,on you know uh Boolean Oracle uh there
1827.659,4.581,is another one which is basically Grover
1830.72,5.22,uh
1832.24,6.0,let me show it separately
1835.94,2.3,foreign
1840.159,4.301,qubit okay so there are whenever we you
1843.14,3.0,know when you are looking into the
1844.46,3.12,literature there are two Global search
1846.14,4.2,algorithms one of them is the angular
1847.58,4.56,qubit with the other one without that in
1850.34,3.66,one case we are saving the solution in
1852.14,3.72,unsolute qubit in the other case we are
1854.0,3.899,saving the solution in the overall
1855.86,4.799,amplitude logging obviously we are
1857.899,5.88,adding a negative uh phase in front of
1860.659,4.38,like you know our our superposition uh
1863.779,2.581,make sure like you know you understand
1865.039,3.181,the difference between the two but
1866.36,4.319,anyhow let me just focus on you know
1868.22,4.319,what's What's Happening Here so first
1870.679,3.661,you know I need to prepare my Quantum
1872.539,3.601,estate so and this is you know basically
1874.34,4.439,this step for preparation
1876.14,4.98,so what I'm doing here I'll make sure
1878.779,5.941,that like you know the answer qubit is
1881.12,5.58,prepared in state one that's what like
1884.72,4.319,you know I added and not set here and
1886.7,5.219,then like you know I had hadamard you
1889.039,4.561,know on all of them uh to have a sort of
1891.919,3.301,like you know you know uniform
1893.6,3.78,superposition and again you know let's
1895.22,3.54,read like you know the code here and
1897.38,4.26,this is again you know one of the other
1898.76,4.919,things that uh By Design you know we
1901.64,4.8,spend so much resources making sure that
1903.679,5.281,you know the code is also readable not
1906.44,4.979,applied on the third one and then we
1908.96,6.599,have hadamard a collection of other mod
1911.419,6.721,on three qubits uh there is like instead
1915.559,4.62,of like you know this design you can go
1918.14,3.659,like somebody would say like look you
1920.179,3.841,know I want to do it like this I want to
1921.799,5.901,say like you know how the amount it's
1924.02,3.68,acting on uh
1928.82,4.32,and one and two and three so that's
1931.34,5.219,that's the same thing
1933.14,6.06,okay uh
1936.559,4.98,again like you know this uh particular
1939.2,4.56,design like you know it's
1941.539,3.24,maybe easier than this one but anyhow
1943.76,4.139,like you know
1944.779,4.681,you can use you know either one uh the
1947.899,3.66,second one like you know it's good
1949.46,5.219,because sometimes you may want to act I
1951.559,6.061,don't know how the mod only on some
1954.679,5.281,specific you know qubits without and
1957.62,3.9,skipping some of them okay so that's all
1959.96,3.42,like you know giving it as an order
1961.52,4.019,maybe it's better than just giving it
1963.38,4.799,you know in this form but anyhow like
1965.539,4.921,you know that's our preparation and now
1968.179,6.0,look look what I'm doing here so here is
1970.46,6.12,basically like you know I'm I'm making a
1974.179,4.74,composition of some circuits remember
1976.58,4.44,this is one circuit this is another
1978.919,3.541,second and look how it is done I'm
1981.02,2.879,saying that like you know the notation
1982.46,2.819,that we have here is just for the right
1983.899,3.301,composition I'm just saying I don't know
1985.279,4.981,okay start with like you know the
1987.2,6.0,circuit that I call prepare and then
1990.26,4.98,Grover and then measure cubic number one
1993.2,3.54,and qubit number two
1995.24,4.64,and this is a circuit that I have
1996.74,3.14,constructed out of that
2004.659,4.26,so get along you know remember like you
2006.399,3.721,know that this is another way of like
2008.919,3.48,you know thinking about like the
2010.12,4.5,composition it's literally like you know
2012.399,4.02,whatever operation you have as far as
2014.62,4.2,like you know it isn't an operation
2016.419,4.321,remember operation means transforming
2018.82,3.599,the quantum estate you can have you know
2020.74,4.26,their Quant you can have their like you
2022.419,4.14,know the composition the first one is a
2025.0,3.179,Quantum circuit this is a Quantum
2026.559,3.181,circuit this is a general measurement
2028.179,3.061,operator but you can you know compose
2029.74,4.2,them together
2031.24,4.14,okay so this is our circuit and now I'm
2033.94,5.16,saying that you know okay this circuit
2035.38,5.519,is acting on you know uh a ground state
2039.1,2.579,of cubic number one through qubit number
2040.899,3.66,three
2041.679,4.38,you can save explicitly like as you can
2044.559,3.54,say that you know we have three Estates
2046.059,3.961,all of them are preparing Quantum state
2048.099,4.74,zero that's one way of like you know
2050.02,4.859,doing that or again like you know as far
2052.839,3.901,as you you are dealing with the register
2054.879,4.98,State this is sometimes what we call as
2056.74,5.34,a register statement by the way
2059.859,4.02,this is another way of you know doing
2062.08,5.519,exactly the same so you can say go with
2063.879,7.621,the register state of three qubits
2067.599,5.941,okay so this is the same as what we have
2071.5,4.08,here the same as what we have here many
2073.54,3.839,times like you know if you see me or you
2075.58,4.2,know other people that go from do coding
2077.379,3.78,you know in our framework you go we go
2079.78,3.48,with the short-term representation look
2081.159,3.421,anyhow do whatever way that you're more
2083.26,2.94,comfortable with
2084.58,4.74,and because we had like you know the
2086.2,4.62,measurements okay so the result you know
2089.32,3.72,is an object which is quantum
2090.82,3.779,measurement
2093.04,4.26,okay because again like you know we had
2094.599,4.861,you know measurement operator here
2097.3,4.62,you see here like you know that the the
2099.46,4.62,double you know horizontal line on the
2101.92,3.6,top that's basically a classical Warrior
2104.08,2.46,you know that that's the wire that
2105.52,3.18,you're saving you know classical
2106.54,4.319,information and by the way you know one
2108.7,4.379,more time all the labelings that you see
2110.859,4.441,here the label on the left the label on
2113.079,4.081,the right whatever you are like showing
2115.3,3.539,like you know the classical Warrior or
2117.16,3.72,not showing a classical Warrior you can
2118.839,3.78,customize them whatever you want you can
2120.88,3.54,eliminate it you can change the color
2122.619,3.24,you can make it brighter you can make it
2124.42,3.36,darker like you know you can you can do
2125.859,3.661,whatever you want but again let's see
2127.78,3.72,look you know I did you know all this
2129.52,5.64,operation and I did like my measurement
2131.5,5.94,now now the question is okay so what
2135.16,5.22,now let's let's look at the you know
2137.44,5.52,probability you know distribution so
2140.38,4.38,what I'm saying here is you know just
2142.96,3.18,return the probability plot of the
2144.76,4.68,results and remember because we were
2146.14,5.34,measuring two qubits HQ by two possible
2149.44,4.38,you know outcomes so the potential
2151.48,4.32,outcomes are four of course like you
2153.82,3.9,know I'm kind of cheating I'm using a
2155.8,3.539,simple example that you know that shows
2157.72,3.84,you directly the result even go over
2159.339,4.381,yourself algorithmic is usually more
2161.56,3.84,complicated than that but anyhow look at
2163.72,3.899,the outcome with the largest probability
2165.4,4.32,here is a very special case you know I
2167.619,6.541,mean productive one you'll get the case
2169.72,7.08,that q1 is in one Q two is in zero
2174.16,3.6,now let me remind you what was the
2176.8,4.08,solution
2177.76,5.099,the solution was the first one true the
2180.88,4.68,second one false
2182.859,5.72,one and zero and that's exactly the
2185.56,3.019,solution that we obtain
2190.839,6.721,okay so that's basically like you know a
2194.46,7.0,very simple you know Quantum algorithm
2197.56,5.76,for various specific you know
2201.46,3.44,objective and of course like you know
2203.32,4.86,there is a
2204.9,5.56,Hot Topic for any Quantum algorithm is
2208.18,3.62,like you know how much it is you know
2210.46,4.56,better than you know classical
2211.8,4.72,counterparts okay so that that's a
2215.02,3.48,completely different topic like you know
2216.52,4.079,to be honest with you you know I'm not
2218.5,3.78,an expert on that but like you know I
2220.599,4.141,understand it but
2222.28,5.1,uh I would leave it to special like you
2224.74,4.619,know mathematician or you know uh
2227.38,3.12,computer scientists with Quantum
2229.359,2.881,expertise like you know they can
2230.5,4.32,elaborate more on that there are lots of
2232.24,4.8,you know uh textbook on that
2234.82,4.08,uh let me just mention one other thing
2237.04,4.68,like you know you notice you know the
2238.9,5.28,way that I created My overall circuit
2241.72,5.82,was using this fancy notation and right
2244.18,4.74,composition etc etc okay so you may have
2247.54,3.539,a different mindset you may have you
2248.92,5.1,know look what I'm doing here at the end
2251.079,5.161,of the day it is also like you know a
2254.02,3.839,composition of bunch of circuits and the
2256.24,3.66,circuit number one is prepare the second
2257.859,3.801,number two is over and then I do
2259.9,5.52,measurements so
2261.66,6.76,why not giving them as a list inside the
2265.42,4.86,circuit operator yes that's you can do
2268.42,2.82,that you know and you would get this
2270.28,3.24,result
2271.24,3.78,the only difference is like you know in
2273.52,3.48,terms of you know visualization because
2275.02,4.5,like you know now you're feeding each
2277.0,5.7,one of them as a circuit we just wrap it
2279.52,5.04,around like you know that gray box and
2282.7,3.659,the label on the top like you know it's
2284.56,3.539,basically the composition of like you
2286.359,3.181,know whatever you do but again like you
2288.099,3.24,know if you don't want to see these
2289.54,4.44,boxes or if you don't want to see those
2291.339,5.161,labels you can easily eliminate them
2293.98,4.8,okay like you can customize all of them
2296.5,4.82,and of course like you know this you
2298.78,2.54,know the result
2303.22,3.68,is going to be exactly the same as a
2304.96,4.139,previous one right so
2306.9,5.5,there are different only in terms of
2309.099,6.861,like you know uh visualization
2312.4,7.439,uh that was basically a very you know
2315.96,6.7,simple introduction to you know Quantum
2319.839,4.441,computation using our framework so the
2322.66,3.12,way that I want you guys to like you
2324.28,4.02,know those of you who are new to this
2325.78,5.64,field is just think about like you know
2328.3,5.52,a targeted state
2331.42,4.679,and then a very particular way of you
2333.82,4.2,know preparing that state keep that in
2336.099,4.5,mind at the very end you are always
2338.02,6.12,dealing with the measurement results
2340.599,5.461,okay so it's a probabilistic like you
2344.14,4.26,know reasoning if if you want to think
2346.06,3.32,about it but that's how that's how we do
2348.4,4.56,it
2349.38,6.16,in quantum theory and by the way this is
2352.96,3.96,not the only Paradigm to do Quantum
2355.54,4.26,Computing the product that I'm
2356.92,6.179,explaining here is what we usually call
2359.8,5.039,as a gate based Paradigm and majority of
2363.099,3.841,like you know Quantum Processing Unit
2364.839,3.721,the actual Quantum hardness out there
2366.94,4.139,there now they are claiming that like
2368.56,6.059,you know if we can trust another quantum
2371.079,6.121,but anyhow uh it's a gate base
2374.619,3.841,uh there are some companies that are
2377.2,3.18,offering like you know a different
2378.46,5.04,approach like for example like you know
2380.38,5.64,like you know the d-wave you know for
2383.5,5.64,them is not a gate base like you know
2386.02,5.16,approach to do Quantum Computing uh in
2389.14,4.14,those cases like you know for a very
2391.18,4.679,particular objective you know you with
2393.28,4.44,design like you know hamiltonian and
2395.859,3.601,then like you know that hamiltonian that
2397.72,4.139,very particular hamiltonian would do the
2399.46,4.619,job for you so it's a very completely
2401.859,4.26,different approach compared to like you
2404.079,3.681,know what what we have here
2406.119,3.841,uh in terms of like you know
2407.76,5.26,experimental which one is better which
2409.96,4.44,one is like you know I I don't know that
2413.02,3.9,that's a question for the
2414.4,4.92,experimentalism and we should wait and
2416.92,5.419,see like you know the
2419.32,5.22,monitor the progress in in experimental
2422.339,4.181,advancement of like you know Quantum
2424.54,6.26,processing units
2426.52,4.28,so that was basically like you know
2431.02,7.339,what I had
2433.0,5.359,prepared for today so if
2438.52,5.22,uh
2440.44,4.919,there is anything that has not been uh
2443.74,3.96,one more time remember like you know you
2445.359,4.321,just need to install the packlet
2447.7,3.899,after like you know installing the
2449.68,3.54,packet if you do not you know quit your
2451.599,3.661,kernel like you know the functions will
2453.22,4.2,be there but if you quit your kernel
2455.26,4.74,like you know yeah you have to basically
2457.42,6.14,uh install the packet every time that
2460.0,3.56,you're creating your own character
2465.4,3.66,and of course everything behind the
2467.26,4.28,scene is done but yeah it's classical
2469.06,6.5,like you know we are doing a Quantum
2471.54,4.02,algorithm on a classical machine
2476.38,4.44,okay it's you can by the way like you
2479.44,4.08,know we have we have it in your
2480.82,4.98,documentation if you are interested you
2483.52,4.62,can send your queries from a world from
2485.8,5.039,notebook you can get send your queries
2488.14,5.219,to a Quantum Processing Unit uh you can
2490.839,4.26,use like you know either IBM you know uh
2493.359,4.74,Quantum processing units you can use
2495.099,5.821,anything that is available on AWS and
2498.099,4.441,like you know uh just wait like you know
2500.92,3.0,get your result and then like you know
2502.54,3.68,do whatever processing you want to do
2503.92,2.3,with that
