0.0,4.48,a common question that i get asked is do
2.32,4.4,i need data visualization to become a
4.48,4.88,data scientist not to spoil things too
6.72,4.72,early but the answer is a resounding yes
9.36,3.52,in this video i talk through why dataviz
11.44,3.84,is important for the data science
12.88,4.159,process and how you can leverage it to
15.28,4.88,your advantage in your studies your
17.039,5.041,projects and on your job we've all heard
20.16,4.64,the saying that a picture is worth a
22.08,5.279,thousand words it's cliche but there's
24.8,4.559,immense truth to this statement in data
27.359,4.08,science i like to say that one graph is
29.359,4.081,worth a thousand tables
31.439,3.681,when exploring data data visualization
33.44,4.0,allows us to understand spatial
35.12,5.04,relationships between variables we can
37.44,4.959,also understand magnitude and time at
40.16,4.96,least for me looking at tabular data
42.399,4.48,even central tendency statistics tells
45.12,3.68,only part of the story the first real
46.879,3.921,value i find in data visualization is
48.8,4.0,for getting to know our data set and for
50.8,3.759,framing our analysis with data
52.8,3.84,visualization you can immediately get an
54.559,5.281,understanding of the distribution of the
56.64,5.84,data correlations between variables and
59.84,5.44,the trends in the data over time in this
62.48,5.12,sense creating visuals saves us time and
65.28,4.48,adds to our ability to frame the problem
67.6,4.48,at hand the visual part of our brain has
69.76,4.399,enormous processing power and that helps
72.08,4.48,us to make sense of the massive volumes
74.159,4.32,of information that we see i often find
76.56,3.76,that when i look at data in tabular form
78.479,4.32,it looks fine but once i graph it
80.32,4.56,something immediately looks off
82.799,3.761,we can easily notice small differences
84.88,4.16,in graphs that might not have been
86.56,4.32,obvious in these other data formats so
89.04,3.28,maybe you're a machine learning engineer
90.88,4.16,you aren't doing much exploratory
92.32,4.24,analysis is data visualization still
95.04,3.28,useful to you
96.56,2.72,again my answer is
98.32,2.24,yes
99.28,2.879,while your visuals might serve a
100.56,3.919,different purpose they're still
102.159,4.0,unbelievably valuable to your role when
104.479,3.041,building models we need a way to
106.159,3.441,evaluate them
107.52,4.08,if we're comparing different models it
109.6,3.839,also makes sense to compare performance
111.6,3.76,over time the best way to convey
113.439,4.881,information like this is usually
115.36,5.119,visually you often see graphs of roc auc
118.32,4.32,curves residual plots and future
120.479,4.24,importance again these are far easier
122.64,4.24,for us to digest than the raw data
124.719,4.32,itself if you have to explain your model
126.88,4.8,to someone else these visuals can also
129.039,4.881,be extremely handy this brings us to the
131.68,3.84,third value of data visualization
133.92,3.92,sometimes data scientists are making
135.52,4.32,recommendations and other times they're
137.84,4.56,creating tools for business stakeholders
139.84,4.24,to use for better decision making some
142.4,3.76,may argue that this would fall under the
144.08,4.0,data analyst work as well i personally
146.16,4.48,love the idea that i can make powerful
148.08,4.239,data analysis accessible to people that
150.64,3.12,aren't quite technical through the
152.319,3.441,things that i build
153.76,3.92,with the right tools data visualization
155.76,3.839,allows almost anyone to generate
157.68,4.16,valuable insight from a data set as it
159.599,4.881,so happens one of those incredible tools
161.84,4.56,atoti is the sponsor of this video a
164.48,4.24,toti is a python library that you can
166.4,4.88,use to quickly build bi analytics
168.72,4.4,dashboards on top of any data source
171.28,3.44,this only takes a few lines of code and
173.12,3.92,can be done directly in a jupyter
174.72,3.84,notebook what i love about this specific
177.04,3.6,platform is that it allows you to
178.56,4.56,collaborate with your not as technical
180.64,4.16,peers through their unique interface
183.12,3.44,with a tote you can bring to life your
184.8,4.28,data visualizations your what-if
186.56,5.2,analyses your simulations and your
189.08,5.72,multi-dimensional analysis ototi just
191.76,4.96,released version 0.6.0 and i highly
194.8,4.159,recommend you install it to check it out
196.72,4.56,yourself like all of the modules and
198.959,4.56,tools that i have as sponsors atoti has
201.28,4.48,a community edition that is completely
203.519,4.161,free to use often you need to present
205.76,3.36,your findings to business stakeholders
207.68,3.52,we sometimes forget that these people
209.12,4.32,are not data scientists themselves we
211.2,3.92,can drone on and on about the specifics
213.44,4.4,of our models and their performance but
215.12,4.64,again often it's better to show rather
217.84,3.759,than tell dataviz can be extremely
219.76,4.0,effective for conveying complicated
221.599,3.92,information in a digestible way just
223.76,3.44,like how visualization can help us to
225.519,3.521,make sense of our own data it can help
227.2,3.599,others to make sense of our findings too
229.04,4.08,i have a rule of thumb that if i'm
230.799,4.401,presenting to anyone i have at least one
233.12,3.679,visual ready to help me illustrate my
235.2,3.679,point when i started doing this the
236.799,3.681,effectiveness of my interactions they
238.879,3.601,went through the roof another thing that
240.48,3.839,people don't think about is the virality
242.48,4.16,of a good database
244.319,4.0,if you share a graph or a dashboard it's
246.64,3.679,really easy for someone else to forward
248.319,4.081,it along you can begin to get more buy
250.319,4.081,in on your ideas if they're clearly
252.4,4.799,communicated and they can spread like
254.4,4.32,wildfire across your company or even
257.199,3.681,your friend group a great example of
258.72,4.24,this is the data is beautiful subreddit
260.88,4.319,people just love to look at and share
262.96,4.32,compelling visuals i think it gets
265.199,4.241,overlooked quite frequently but our job
267.28,4.08,as data scientists is to drive change in
269.44,3.92,an organization it's to build a new
271.36,4.64,model or to make a recommendation that
273.36,4.24,inspires action this is the last aspect
276.0,2.639,of dataviz that i want to highlight in
277.6,2.56,this video
278.639,4.241,if you're in a meeting and you show a
280.16,4.64,great data visualization it's often very
282.88,4.0,clear what the next step should be
284.8,3.839,visuals are intended to illustrate what
286.88,3.68,might be the right course of action i've
288.639,4.0,been in so many meetings where people
290.56,3.84,were arguing about what to do and then
292.639,3.921,when you put a slide on the screen the
294.4,4.239,decision becomes immediately obvious to
296.56,4.88,everyone i kind of look at a great
298.639,4.881,visualization a bit like a superpower
301.44,4.479,and as we know superpowers can be used
303.52,4.399,for good or for evil since dataviz can
305.919,3.84,be used to powerfully drive decision
307.919,4.081,making we really have to be careful that
309.759,4.481,we're not massaging the data to lobby
312.0,3.6,for something that we personally want i
314.24,3.12,hope this video helped you to better
315.6,3.52,understand how data visualization can
317.36,4.08,help you as a data scientist or an
319.12,4.24,aspiring data scientist something that i
321.44,3.68,wanted to end on is that there's a lot
323.36,3.76,made of soft skills and communication
325.12,4.4,skills in this space i think those are
327.12,4.24,integrally important but compelling data
329.52,3.679,visual skills can also help to
331.36,3.839,complement those for people that might
333.199,4.401,be less comfortable sharing in front of
335.199,4.401,a group special thanks to ototi for
337.6,4.24,supporting the channel and to you for
339.6,5.99,watching this video until next time good
341.84,11.669,luck on your data science journey
