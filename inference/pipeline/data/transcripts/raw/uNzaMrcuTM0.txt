0.03,5.729,this video was sponsored by Coursera if
2.85,5.13,you and I wanted to let's say pass notes
5.759,3.931,in class such that if anyone opened the
7.98,3.51,note up they would have no idea what it
9.69,3.63,said but we can still figure it out
11.49,4.2,there are several methods for doing this
13.32,4.35,for example maybe beforehand we could
15.69,4.08,agree on shifting all the letters by
17.67,5.22,three in order to encrypt our message
19.77,5.13,otherwise known as the Caesar cipher so
22.89,4.559,if I wanted to say hello I'd write a
24.9,6.93,word with those same letters shifted by
27.449,8.52,three instead of H I'd write K since K
31.83,8.79,is one two three letters past H instead
35.969,7.381,of e I'd write H L goes to O and O goes
40.62,5.099,to R so this is the encrypted message
43.35,3.93,that I send you then when you receive
45.719,3.241,the snow all you do is ship the letters
47.28,3.9,three to the left and you get the
48.96,3.84,original message back but this is too
51.18,3.539,simple so if someone could just try a
52.8,3.899,bunch of shifts and figure out what the
54.719,3.36,original message was but hopefully you
56.699,3.811,can see the foundations of cryptography
58.079,4.441,are pretty simple you have some message
60.51,4.229,you want to send or the plain text like
62.52,3.93,hello and you encrypt this to create a
64.739,4.321,bunch of gibberish otherwise known as
66.45,4.56,the cipher text that we saw earlier this
69.06,3.809,is then decrypted back to plain text and
71.01,3.149,this is what we just did using our
72.869,3.991,specific encryption and decryption
74.159,4.681,algorithm of shifting by three but let's
76.86,4.47,do something else instead let's come up
78.84,4.5,with a secret word or key that will swap
81.33,3.81,around the letters for us for this
83.34,4.23,scenario let's just say our secret key
85.14,4.14,is computer and now I want to encrypt
87.57,4.17,the message you can trust me
89.28,4.379,well since the message is longer than
91.74,4.169,the key I'll just rewrite the key
93.659,5.491,repeatedly until the end and now what
95.909,5.25,you do is really just add the letters C
99.15,5.219,is the third letter of the alphabet so
101.159,5.371,we I go three past Y now since Y is at
104.369,5.28,the end all we do is wrap around back to
106.53,7.71,a so we go three letters past Y wrap
109.649,8.371,around and land at B o is the 15th
114.24,6.0,letter if we add o or another 15 we get
118.02,2.639,30 and to figure out the letter more
120.24,3.3,quickly
120.659,6.0,remember that Z is the 26th letter so
123.54,6.689,you could say 27 corresponds to a 28
126.659,5.491,with B which would make 30 go with deep
130.229,4.381,and we can do this for the rest of the
132.15,4.29,message to get our cipher text to
134.61,3.44,decrypt it you would just subtract by
136.44,4.2,the secret key
138.05,4.299,now that wrapping around we just saw is
140.64,4.14,actually the start of the real math I'm
142.349,5.281,gonna get into soon so we just saw the
144.78,6.06,25th letter y plus the third letter C
147.63,5.55,gave us B which is the second letter but
150.84,4.71,we really know that 25 plus 3 is in fact
153.18,4.44,28 in fact we could say that 28
155.55,3.99,corresponds with 2 and we'll use this
157.62,4.11,symbol to show that but this works
159.54,4.44,specifically for the 26 letter alphabet
161.73,4.71,and this is the same math you do as with
163.98,5.099,a 12-hour clock if it's a lemon o'clock
166.44,4.019,disregarding a.m. or p.m. what time will
169.079,4.831,it be in 3 hours
170.459,7.261,well obviously it'll be 2 but 11 plus 3
173.91,5.88,is really 14 so 14 corresponds with 2 on
177.72,3.87,a 12-hour clock because just like with
179.79,5.309,the alphabet you wrap around to the
181.59,6.179,beginning now the official way to write
185.099,6.991,and say all of this is 14 is congruent
187.769,6.481,to 2 modulo 12 the visual way to think
192.09,5.369,about this is if the integers continue
194.25,5.94,to wrap around a clock 14 + 2 would land
197.459,5.4,at the same place in fact if we kept
200.19,5.85,going 26 would also land there which
202.859,6.75,means 26 is congruent to 14 as well as 2
206.04,6.419,modulo 12 then algebraically the reason
209.609,5.91,26 is congruent to 2 mod 12 is because
212.459,5.881,if you subtract 26 + 2 the result is
215.519,5.821,divisible by 12 or you can see that 20
218.34,6.179,is congruent to 8 mod 12 since 20 minus
221.34,5.76,8 is divisible by 12 same goes for all
224.519,5.22,these pairs of numbers on the clock so
227.1,4.139,this is where we're headed and I'm going
229.739,3.421,to get back to this soon but this is the
231.239,3.511,beginning of number theory the main
233.16,4.049,branch of mathematics used for
234.75,3.78,cryptography but first the encryption we
237.209,3.12,are just using is known as the
238.53,3.81,Visionaire cipher which is used during
240.329,4.201,the sixteenth century however there's a
242.34,4.89,problem with it though if we used our
244.53,5.22,secret key many times like over hundreds
247.23,4.74,of messages an adversary could intercept
249.75,3.87,those and using frequency analysis they
251.97,3.75,can eventually decipher what our
253.62,3.63,original messages were in the English
255.72,3.48,language the most popular letters e
257.25,4.409,which comes up about twelve point seven
259.2,3.48,percent on the time next up is T which
261.659,3.721,comes up about nine
262.68,4.68,one percent then a which comes up about
265.38,4.53,eight point one percent followed by oh
267.36,4.559,and so I was curious about this so I
269.91,4.11,found an online frequency analysis tool
271.919,4.171,and copied in the first chapter of Harry
274.02,4.8,Potter and the most popular letters
276.09,4.41,correspondent pretty accurately oh and a
278.82,3.48,were just a little mixed up but yeah
280.5,3.69,using this there are ways to crack the
282.3,5.16,Visionaire cipher over many many
284.19,5.31,messages you can see that having a key
287.46,4.23,is important in cryptography so now
289.5,4.56,let's talk about key exchange or how to
291.69,4.229,establish a secret key when you have to
294.06,2.55,exchange it with someone over a public
295.919,2.22,champ
296.61,4.05,so I'll start this with a question a
298.139,6.691,friend and I want to share a secret key
300.66,6.66,or in this case a secret number now the
304.83,5.94,problem is there's an eavesdropper who
307.32,4.65,can see or hear anything that we say or
310.77,3.36,write or whatever
311.97,4.08,okay literally anything we can't use
314.13,3.539,another language we can't whisper to
316.05,3.54,each other or nothing like that and
317.669,4.051,let's say it's a new friend so you guys
319.59,4.62,don't know much about each other now the
321.72,5.28,question is is this task even possible
324.21,4.139,to come up with a secret key that only
327.0,3.9,you two can understand but the
328.349,2.79,eavesdropper cannot well give that some
330.9,1.68,thought
331.139,2.791,because now we've reached a point where
332.58,4.11,we need the real math I want to talk
333.93,6.989,about or number theory aka the study of
336.69,7.4,integers so pop quiz this 10 congruent
340.919,6.301,to 6 modulo 4 well yes it is
344.09,5.949,algebraically it's because 10 minus 6 is
347.22,5.25,divisible by 4 visually if I had a clock
350.039,4.951,with only 4 numbers I just kept wrapping
352.47,4.979,integers around it 10 and 6 would land
354.99,5.22,at the same location and since 10 is 5
357.449,5.521,times 2 we can say that 5 times 2 is
360.21,4.44,congruent to 6 mod 4 which I know looks
362.97,3.84,really weird but now we're starting to
364.65,3.329,do arithmetic with a number theory but
366.81,3.99,now let's see what other type of
367.979,6.18,arithmetic we can apply to this like
370.8,8.85,could I divide both sides by 2 and get 5
374.159,8.13,is congruent to 3 mod 4 well no this is
379.65,5.489,incorrect because 5 minus 3 is not
382.289,5.85,divisible by 4 but why didn't that work
385.139,5.101,well the first equation says 10 minus 6
388.139,6.33,is divisible by 4 but what that actually
390.24,5.72,means is 10 minus 6 equals 4 times some
394.469,4.23,integer we'll call
395.96,5.199,now we know this is true for some value
398.699,6.24,n in this case one but if i factor out a
401.159,6.66,2 from both terms does this also mean
404.939,5.521,that this part the 5 minus 3 is also
407.819,5.37,divisible by 4 well clearly that's not
410.46,5.549,true which means 5 is not congruent to 3
413.189,5.581,mod 4 and one way to think about this is
416.009,5.791,that the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2
418.77,5.04,and two of these twos do not appear in
421.8,4.32,either of these terms it's the
423.81,4.379,combination of these terms which lead to
426.12,4.019,this so none of these individually is
428.189,4.081,visible by 4 so that's why you can't
430.139,2.821,just divide by 2 and have something
432.27,7.53,that's correct
432.96,9.9,but look at this 72 is congruent to 12
439.8,6.57,mod 15 which should be easy to see at
442.86,9.54,this point if I divide both sides by 2 I
446.37,9.389,get 36 is congruent to 6 mod 15 and this
452.4,5.699,in fact is also true since 36 minus 6 is
455.759,3.72,divisible by a 15 so before we go
458.099,3.451,further let's just think about is there
459.479,4.41,some rule for when we can divide both
461.55,4.88,sides and of course the answer is yes if
463.889,6.601,the number that you're dividing and the
466.43,7.209,modulus are relatively prime then you're
470.49,4.889,able to do the division and relatively
473.639,4.2,prime just means 1 is the only number
475.379,4.171,that can go evenly into both like 9 and
477.839,4.351,10 are relatively prime since nothing
479.55,6.239,goes into both of them besides 1 same
482.19,6.39,with 70 and 33 another way to see it is
485.789,6.451,the prime factorizations of let's say 70
488.58,6.899,and 33 have nothing in common so we can
492.24,7.199,say that from this equation 72 minus 12
495.479,7.951,equals 15 times some integer n if we
499.439,7.95,factor out a 2 we get 2 times 36 minus 6
503.43,5.609,equals 15 times some integer n now
507.389,5.041,you'll notice that the prime factors of
509.039,5.581,15 are 5 and 3 which means this side of
512.43,5.18,the equation is going to be 5 times 3
514.62,5.849,times some other stuff whatever n is
517.61,6.13,this side of the equation therefore also
520.469,4.181,must contain 5 times 3 times some other
523.74,3.01,stuff
524.65,4.59,and because five and three don't appear
526.75,4.8,in this first term since two and 15 are
529.24,5.039,again relatively prime then the five and
531.55,5.97,the three must appear in this term and
534.279,5.581,in fact five times three times two would
537.52,4.17,get us what this is thirty and that
539.86,4.47,means that this term is divisible by 15
541.69,4.89,because it contains the factors five and
544.33,5.79,three and that means that this equation
546.58,8.43,does hold because 36 minus six is
550.12,6.3,divisible by 15 but hopefully you see we
555.01,3.75,cannot divide both sides of this
556.42,6.48,equation by six now and get six this
558.76,6.45,congruent to 1 mod 15 because well this
562.9,5.16,is obviously wrong and six is not
565.21,5.16,relatively prime to 15 since three goes
568.06,4.02,into both of them now those are some of
570.37,3.51,the basics but there's so many theorems
572.08,3.509,in this field that no one video could
573.88,3.06,cover but a lot of them show some really
575.589,3.061,interesting relationships between
576.94,4.53,numbers when it comes like primes
578.65,6.87,divisibility and so for example if I
581.47,7.97,pick a prime P and raise any integer to
585.52,10.8,the P minus 1 it will be congruent to 1
589.44,10.24,mod P if we let P equal 5 and X equal 2
596.32,8.31,we can see that 2 to the 4th or P minus
599.68,8.34,1 is congruent to 1 mod 5 since to the
604.63,8.16,4th is 16 16 minus 1 is 15 which is
608.02,9.18,divisible by 5 but instead if P is let's
612.79,9.78,say a hundred and thirteen and X is 18 I
617.2,11.13,know that 18 to the 112 or P minus 1 is
622.57,8.55,congruent to 1 mod 113 I have no idea
628.33,5.64,what this number is but I know that if I
631.12,6.32,subtract 1 from it that will be
633.97,5.7,divisible by a hundred and thirteen
637.44,4.63,there's another similar theorem but to
639.67,4.65,understand it let me first ask this how
642.07,5.61,many integers less than or equal to 10
644.32,8.13,are relatively prime to 10 well there's
647.68,6.6,1 3 7 & 9 so there are four numbers in
652.45,3.81,number theory this comes from euler's
654.28,3.51,totient function which is written using
656.26,6.58,5 event
657.79,7.15,so 510 is four because there are four
662.84,5.28,integers less than ten that are
664.94,8.22,relatively prime to ten another example
668.12,7.14,could be Phi of 15 is 8 because there
673.16,6.54,are 8 integers that are relatively prime
675.26,9.21,to 15 notice for a prime number that Phi
679.7,6.51,of P is always P minus 1 and this is
684.47,6.99,because nothing goes into a prime but
686.21,11.1,one in itself like 5 7 would be 6 since
691.46,10.14,1 2 3 4 5 & 6 are all relatively prime
697.31,6.39,to 7 a total of 6 numbers so oiler came
701.6,5.76,up with a more general theorem that said
703.7,9.32,an integer X raised to the Phi of some
707.36,8.52,integer n is always congruent to 1 mod n
713.02,8.14,assuming that X and n are relatively
715.88,9.3,prime so if n is 15 we saw that Phi of
721.16,7.86,15 is 8 meaning some integer let's say
725.18,8.94,14 raised to the 8th power is congruent
729.02,6.72,to 1 mod 15 which I find really
734.12,4.08,interesting because I don't know what
735.74,6.42,this is but I do know that if I subtract
738.2,6.59,1 the result is divisible by 15 I'd
742.16,6.66,remember that Phi of some prime number P
744.79,7.03,always equals P minus 1 so if I use P
748.82,6.38,for n here and then plug in P minus 1 up
751.82,8.58,here I get X to the P minus 1 is
755.2,8.53,congruent to 1 mod P which is the same
760.4,4.77,as that theorem we saw earlier ok so now
763.73,3.3,we're ready to see this actually applied
765.17,4.23,to cryptography and we're gonna look at
767.03,4.05,the diffie-hellman protocol so this is
769.4,3.36,how we go to exchange a secret key with
771.08,3.48,each other so that an eavesdropper
772.76,3.39,couldn't figure it out or at least
774.56,2.969,they'd have a very difficult time trying
776.15,2.55,to figure it out even if they had a
777.529,3.231,computer
778.7,2.06,you
