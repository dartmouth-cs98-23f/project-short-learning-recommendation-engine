10.24,2.24,hello everyone welcome to another
11.759,3.281,episode
12.48,4.32,and today we have devon chatterjee a
15.04,3.04,predictive analytics consultant at
16.8,2.72,lasalle network
18.08,3.44,and today we're speaking more about the
19.52,3.36,topic of quantum computing and data
21.52,3.599,science for it
22.88,3.28,so welcome to the show devon i'm such a
25.119,2.721,pleasure to have you today
26.16,3.279,hi hi catherine and thanks for having me
27.84,3.279,on the program yeah absolutely
29.439,3.28,could you tell the audience just more
31.119,3.6,about where you're coming from
32.719,3.68,and your background and just what led
34.719,4.801,you to your role today
36.399,3.521,sure uh so i majored in physics and went
39.52,2.16,to
39.92,3.6,university of new mexico to study
41.68,3.68,quantum information processing that was
43.52,3.199,around 2000 2001
45.36,3.28,i studied under people like murray
46.719,4.801,gilman from there
48.64,4.8,i went to university of chicago to study
51.52,5.44,math and computer science
53.44,4.639,then on to iit to work on my phd in
56.96,3.36,analytics where
58.079,3.841,my dissertation topic was hedge fund
60.32,3.36,replication with deep neural networks
61.92,4.16,and generative adversarial networks
63.68,4.479,when i was in chicago i started working
66.08,3.92,in systems engineering
68.159,3.361,and because of my analytics background i
70.0,3.84,started doing analytics
71.52,4.639,within it and that was before data
73.84,4.72,science was even mainstream
76.159,4.721,so my last position was as a senior data
78.56,6.0,scientist in a cyber security group
80.88,4.08,now i'm consulting helping a company on
84.56,3.04,their
84.96,3.519,digital transformation journey to
87.6,3.28,improve their
88.479,3.841,quality and governance and expand their
90.88,3.76,analytics capabilities
92.32,3.759,in addition i've taught business
94.64,4.72,analytics and data science
96.079,6.08,at iit in northeastern illinois
99.36,5.119,university and i'm currently a course
102.159,4.481,developer and adjunct professor
104.479,3.761,in business analytics at indiana tech
106.64,3.04,yeah that's awesome so you're clearly
108.24,4.559,doing a lot of different things
109.68,4.399,in the data field right now yeah
112.799,3.041,and so what do you think are some
114.079,2.4,similarities and differences that you've
115.84,2.559,seen in
116.479,3.201,quantum computing and data science since
118.399,3.76,i'm sure there's a lot of
119.68,3.439,overlap between these two areas there's
122.159,4.32,actually
123.119,5.12,probably not um that's yeah people might
126.479,3.361,think that but there's actually mostly
128.239,3.681,differences between the two fields
129.84,4.479,as far as similarities i would say both
131.92,5.36,areas are you know expanding due to
134.319,5.041,advances in technology but there's also
137.28,3.44,like a prevalent lack of understanding
139.36,3.36,of both topics
140.72,3.68,mostly quantum computing since it's so
142.72,4.239,much newer than data science
144.4,4.64,but anyone experiencing the uses of you
146.959,5.36,know machine learning and ai
149.04,5.68,at mainly as like buzzwords for example
152.319,3.841,can fully appreciate that comment now
154.72,3.92,quantum computing
156.16,4.96,is one part of a broader quantum
158.64,4.16,technology umbrella similar to ai
161.12,3.199,being you know like under machine
162.8,3.76,learning but
164.319,3.521,in quantum computing there's things like
166.56,3.44,quantum key distribution
167.84,4.64,post quantum cryptography quantum
170.0,4.72,software quantum materials
172.48,3.039,one idea was to utilize quantum
174.72,3.2,mechanics
175.519,4.0,in a computer to speed up the
177.92,3.84,computation of complex
179.519,4.161,problems like those in optimization and
181.76,4.64,finance and biology
183.68,4.32,and eventually machine learning and ai
186.4,3.6,so there's currently some research in
188.0,4.879,the area of quantum machine learning
190.0,4.64,and ai now some of the differences are
192.879,3.28,that data science you know obviously
194.64,3.519,uses classical computers
196.159,3.201,which uses bits you know zeros and ones
198.159,3.921,to perform the operations
199.36,3.36,quantum computers use quantum bits or q
202.08,2.879,bits
202.72,4.64,to process the data so due to their
204.959,3.121,basis in quantum mechanics qubits can be
207.36,3.84,in both
208.08,6.159,a zero and a one state simultaneously
211.2,3.44,due to a concept called superposition so
214.239,2.321,these
214.64,3.92,and other aspects of quantum mechanics
216.56,2.72,will allow quantum computers to obtain
218.56,2.72,what's called
219.28,3.92,quantum supremacy over classical
221.28,4.16,computers quantum supremacy
223.2,4.319,is where a quantum computer can solve a
225.44,2.879,problem much faster than a classical
227.519,2.881,computer
228.319,4.081,so the more complex the problem the
230.4,2.559,better a quantum computer will actually
232.4,3.759,be
232.959,5.121,at solving it faster right google
236.159,3.521,has actually claimed to achieve quantum
238.08,4.4,supremacy in
239.68,4.32,back in 2019 it was around october
242.48,3.44,november of 2019.
244.0,3.519,now before that the progression of
245.92,3.76,quantum computing had been
247.519,3.121,essentially linear but now it's like
249.68,3.04,exponential
250.64,3.36,so there's new participants entering
252.72,4.0,that field every year
254.0,3.28,whether it's startups r d or developing
256.72,2.799,hardware
257.28,3.199,some other differences between the two
259.519,3.041,are
260.479,3.601,in the knowledge required so data
262.56,2.96,science mainly requires
264.08,3.839,you know as you know like knowledge of
265.52,4.16,statistics econometrics programming
267.919,3.761,visualization tools
269.68,4.64,but quantum computing requires knowledge
271.68,4.72,of quantum mechanics and matrix theory
274.32,3.84,to start with so at this point i would
276.4,3.359,also probably say that knowledge of
278.16,3.92,quantum hardware materials and
279.759,4.641,architectures are also needed
282.08,4.08,since there's a few contending
284.4,4.079,approaches to quantum computing
286.16,4.96,like ibm's gate-based solution and
288.479,5.521,d-wave's annealing-based solution
291.12,5.12,so really data science is a way to use
294.0,4.0,statistics visualizations and machine
296.24,3.92,learning and ai algorithms
298.0,3.6,to create solutions to problems and get
300.16,3.2,more answers from the
301.6,3.76,ever-increasing amounts of data that
303.36,4.32,exist whereas
305.36,4.24,quantum computing is mainly a technology
307.68,4.079,based on quantum mechanics
309.6,3.2,that will help solve those problems
311.759,3.841,significantly
312.8,4.239,faster and push past the current
315.6,3.599,computational limits
317.039,3.681,when doing data science on those
319.199,2.961,classical computers
320.72,3.36,it sounds like from just your
322.16,4.0,explanation here it sounds like they can
324.08,3.839,come hand in hand with each other as
326.16,2.08,well and they can really complement each
327.919,2.401,other
328.24,3.12,also um even despite you know their
330.32,3.52,differences right
331.36,3.6,yes absolutely they're you know quantum
333.84,4.079,computing is
334.96,4.4,mainly for you know speeding up those
337.919,3.521,types of problems which
339.36,3.04,machine learning and ai models and
341.44,3.12,algorithms
342.4,3.28,help solve right in a better way than
344.56,3.12,some other things like think
345.68,3.68,think deep neural networks right
347.68,2.799,although you know deep neural networks
349.36,2.72,is a black box but
350.479,3.28,quantum computing i think is probably
352.08,4.8,even more
353.759,4.56,obscure and unknown as to how that works
356.88,2.0,it's a little bit more difficult even
358.319,3.44,but
358.88,4.08,yes definitely uh quantum computing will
361.759,3.44,be able to
362.96,3.04,work hand-in-hand at that point in the
365.199,2.481,future with
366.0,3.68,you know machine learning and ai you
367.68,2.239,know with data science yeah absolutely
369.68,1.92,and
369.919,4.161,for these two topics how are they kind
371.6,4.0,of being used in the it world today
374.08,3.28,everyone kind of knows that data science
375.6,4.159,has a number of business use cases
377.36,3.04,but it also has a number of use cases in
379.759,2.56,it
380.4,3.76,so when hearing about data science i
382.319,4.32,think most people tend to think of
384.16,3.12,business applications like marketing
386.639,3.28,health care
387.28,4.56,claims finance etc right but data
389.919,2.72,science applications in iet and cyber
391.84,3.359,security
392.639,3.201,are comparatively newer application
395.199,3.12,areas
395.84,4.16,in cyber security the main use cases are
398.319,3.6,things like anomaly detection
400.0,3.6,behavioral analytics attack
401.919,4.0,classification or prediction
403.6,4.24,predicting distributed denial of service
405.919,2.321,attacks and privileged user analytics
407.84,2.16,right
408.24,3.6,and one of the big issues or the
410.0,4.479,probably the biggest issues i found
411.84,3.359,was that data is not as easily
414.479,2.401,structured
415.199,3.44,as it is on the business side you know
416.88,3.599,within cyber security and i t
418.639,4.721,and since cyber security leadership
420.479,5.041,tends to be you know people with
423.36,3.36,you know backgrounds and security but
425.52,3.92,not much
426.72,4.0,background in big data and data science
429.44,3.199,then they need to trust the data
430.72,3.44,scientists and data engineers to be the
432.639,3.521,data experts
434.16,3.439,right just like on the business side now
436.16,3.759,in it
437.599,3.121,outside of cyber security there's use
439.919,3.041,cases that
440.72,3.039,that may not be typically implemented at
442.96,2.88,most companies
443.759,3.921,one example from my last position was
445.84,3.6,using machine learning to create
447.68,4.4,a probability risk score for change
449.44,3.92,management so here we used historical
452.08,4.239,features of changes
453.36,4.399,incidents and configuration information
456.319,4.32,from infrastructure
457.759,4.081,to help determine a risk score for new
460.639,3.68,changes
461.84,3.039,and their risk of causing an outage so
464.319,2.56,the model
464.879,3.121,used logistic regression to create the
466.879,2.641,risk score
468.0,3.36,if that score was above a certain
469.52,4.079,threshold the it
471.36,4.16,change management team could put it on
473.599,3.841,hold they could reschedule it
475.52,4.239,require additional information and
477.44,4.159,sign-offs things like that
479.759,3.12,so this actually had a realized savings
481.599,4.401,associated with it
482.879,5.201,due to the cost avoidance of outages and
486.0,3.84,i'm doing something similar to this for
488.08,2.559,the company i'm currently consulting for
489.84,3.919,as well
490.639,3.441,now for quantum computing it's actually
493.759,1.921,too
494.08,3.36,new to have current applications in
495.68,4.32,business or it
497.44,3.92,but there is a lot of r d happening in
500.0,3.919,this area right now
501.36,3.2,for example well goldman sachs recently
503.919,2.161,said that they
504.56,3.12,expected to be utilizing quantum
506.08,2.88,applications within the next three to
507.68,3.76,five years
508.96,4.319,anthem is currently developing practical
511.44,2.8,quantum computing applications to
513.279,2.961,enhance the
514.24,3.84,consumer healthcare experience but
516.24,4.479,personally my opinion is
518.08,3.92,i think that quantum programs and
520.719,3.12,applications
522.0,4.08,will take a little bit longer like maybe
523.839,4.241,in the seven to ten year time frame
526.08,3.199,because it's that crawl walk run
528.08,2.96,scenario where
529.279,4.24,you know everyone tends to focus more on
531.04,4.08,the walk and run phases right so
533.519,3.361,but they're still definitely in that
535.12,3.68,crawl phase so
536.88,3.36,there's some some work that needs to be
538.8,4.08,done still but
540.24,3.92,however i want to point out a caveat to
542.88,3.6,that is
544.16,4.08,one area of quantum technology that will
546.48,2.72,definitely be relevant within the next
548.24,4.4,three to five years
549.2,6.24,is quantum security so within that time
552.64,4.72,quantum computing will pose a threat to
555.44,3.76,the security built into every company's
557.36,3.76,it systems
559.2,4.079,state-sponsored quantum computing
561.12,4.56,hacking labs already exist
563.279,3.041,and if a company's existing encrypted
565.68,3.04,data
566.32,4.32,is compromised a threat actor can
568.72,3.6,actually hold onto that data
570.64,3.36,and unencrypt it when the quantum
572.32,3.68,technology is available so
574.0,4.24,last fall i created a quantum risk
576.0,4.24,presentation for our company ciso or the
578.24,4.56,chief information security officer
580.24,3.84,at that time there was a survey that
582.8,3.28,determined that about
584.08,3.36,half of it leaders viewed quantum
586.08,4.56,computing as a threat
587.44,4.399,but 71 percent of them said that they
590.64,2.639,thought it would be a threat within the
591.839,4.641,next three years
593.279,5.361,and this was last year so companies need
596.48,2.799,to look at transitioning to what are
598.64,2.96,called
599.279,3.761,quantum safe solutions there's a number
601.6,3.44,of vendors already offering these
603.04,3.84,solutions but the first thing that
605.04,4.56,companies will need to do is perform
606.88,3.6,a quantum risk assessment then evaluate
609.6,2.96,vendors
610.48,3.919,and quantum safe products and then
612.56,4.32,develop some internal knowledge on
614.399,3.601,quantum technology also finally you know
616.88,3.36,you have to keep track of the
618.0,3.839,developments in quantum computing and
620.24,3.12,quantum key distribution and quantum
621.839,5.601,safe solutions
623.36,6.719,so that's mainly how quantum computing
627.44,3.68,i feel would be utilized then within it
630.079,2.561,in the near future
631.12,3.6,yeah definitely and i think that's such
632.64,3.759,an interesting insight to kind of think
634.72,3.44,about for the future as well with
636.399,3.761,everything really growing in this
638.16,3.359,technology field right now is there any
640.16,2.239,interesting projects that you'd like to
641.519,2.56,talk about that
642.399,3.12,you were able to utilize content
644.079,4.32,computing yeah well
645.519,5.121,so far the only projects i've worked on
648.399,4.721,have been part of you know workshops
650.64,4.08,textbooks or other online sources i
653.12,3.44,started getting back into quantum
654.72,3.119,information processing a few years ago
656.56,4.56,when i ran my first
657.839,6.081,quantum program using quiz kit on ibm
661.12,4.159,q which is ibm's quantum computer you
663.92,2.96,know since then i've obtained
665.279,3.12,some professional certifications in
666.88,3.76,quantum technology
668.399,4.88,attended a number of workshops worked on
670.64,5.84,some programming projects on topics like
673.279,4.881,quantum tomography super dense coding
676.48,3.76,swapping quantum states and quantum
678.16,5.119,teleportation so some interesting
680.24,5.68,projects involving some programming but
683.279,4.721,in addition i'm also connected to
685.92,5.2,founder of a startup in chicago
688.0,4.399,called chicago quantum so last year they
691.12,3.12,used d-waves
692.399,3.201,quantum computers which is a quantum
694.24,3.599,annealing computer
695.6,4.479,to do portfolio optimization and they
697.839,4.0,published a paper on that last july
700.079,3.921,since my dissertation is on hedge fund
701.839,2.961,replication and i use a factor-based
704.0,3.12,approach
704.8,4.32,to creating the portfolios i'm
707.12,3.76,particularly interested in their work
709.12,3.6,so at some point i would like to
710.88,4.079,replicate what they did and possibly
712.72,4.88,apply it to my research topic as well
714.959,3.041,but outside of those types of things
717.6,2.88,there's
718.0,3.279,really not it's not like in data science
720.48,2.479,where you have
721.279,3.921,you know a bunch of stuff on udemy or
722.959,4.081,wherever and and you can you know find a
725.2,2.879,bunch of projects you know on github or
727.04,3.039,whatever so
728.079,3.281,it's kind of limited as far as projects
730.079,3.44,really into quantum computing
731.36,3.599,yeah definitely and i know that you
733.519,2.161,would also mention that quantum
734.959,3.041,computing is
735.68,3.839,kind of a relatively newer field that's
738.0,3.6,um emerging right now
739.519,4.081,and what have been some resources that
741.6,2.4,you've taken a look at just to help you
743.6,2.72,with your
744.0,3.279,journey with learning more about this
746.32,3.92,specific niche
747.279,4.161,sure um well i mean you know we're
750.24,2.88,talking about data science
751.44,3.6,too but those are obvious there's lots
753.12,3.68,of sources available for data science
755.04,4.4,outside of the university courses like i
756.8,4.479,mentioned udemy coursera udacity
759.44,3.6,even facebook groups right and i've
761.279,2.481,utilized all of those at some point so
763.04,2.64,it really
763.76,3.36,depends on for data science it really
765.68,3.12,depends on you know where you are in
767.12,3.68,your data science journey as to what
768.8,4.0,resources you need
770.8,4.32,for quantum computing there's not as
772.8,4.88,much available so aside from university
775.12,5.519,courses in things like quantum mechanics
777.68,3.92,there and quantum information processing
780.639,4.241,there's not
781.6,5.359,a lot of institutions offering programs
784.88,4.639,for example in quantum computing yet so
786.959,4.961,it's kind of like where data science was
789.519,3.681,about 10 years ago or 12 years ago
791.92,3.52,something like that
793.2,3.759,there's a number of seminars conferences
795.44,3.12,and workshops out there
796.959,3.361,you just have to look a little harder to
798.56,2.24,find them but if someone's interested in
800.32,3.199,learning
800.8,4.56,more about quantum computing or quantum
803.519,2.32,technology in general like i would
805.36,3.599,suggest
805.839,4.8,starting there and expanding your
808.959,3.841,resources and connections
810.639,3.521,from there and that that's essentially
812.8,3.44,how i approached it
814.16,3.6,yeah no i think that's great and i
816.24,3.52,wanted to say thank you so much devon
817.76,3.68,for joining us today on the show
819.76,3.12,we the data standard are trying to build
821.44,3.36,a community where everyone can just
822.88,3.519,network and collaborate with each other
824.8,4.24,so what is something that you're kind of
826.399,4.641,looking for out of the community here
829.04,3.919,a couple of things i think first i would
831.04,5.12,certainly be interested in networking
832.959,5.281,collaborating sharing ideas with anybody
836.16,4.239,who's interested in these topics
838.24,4.24,second i've worked on quantum technology
840.399,4.24,risk evaluations and road maps
842.48,3.68,in cyber security so if anyone is
844.639,3.281,interested in
846.16,4.0,learning more about that or doing that
847.92,3.68,within our company you know feel free to
850.16,3.52,contact me for that as well
851.6,4.16,yeah perfect and uh where can everyone
853.68,4.0,find you online just to connect with you
855.76,4.16,well probably the best place would be
857.68,4.159,linkedin you know for anyone interested
859.92,3.2,you can reach out to me on linkedin and
861.839,3.44,and i i
863.12,3.279,you know monitor that you know regularly
865.279,2.721,so perfect
866.399,3.201,and uh to our audience for more
868.0,4.959,information on the data standard you can
869.6,5.28,find us at www.datastandard.io
872.959,3.68,as well as on our linkedin and youtube
874.88,3.44,channel thank you so much devon for
876.639,3.041,joining us it was so great to have you
878.32,3.04,on the show to talk more about
879.68,3.36,quantum computing and data science
881.36,2.79,together hey thanks for having me on the
883.04,31.36,show
