0.299,4.141,human computer interaction is the study
2.7,3.84,of interactions between people and
4.44,3.96,computers it covers the design
6.54,4.679,programming and use of computer
8.4,4.859,interfaces it represents one of the most
11.219,3.84,fascinating emerging fields in computer
13.259,3.721,science and psychology
15.059,3.48,so what exactly is meant by human
16.98,3.959,computer interaction
18.539,4.861,human computer interaction often known
20.939,4.981,as HCI is the study of how people
23.4,4.32,communicate with computers it also
25.92,3.72,encompasses the ways in which humans
27.72,4.98,engage with technological tools and
29.64,5.28,structures Hardware like keyboards mice
32.7,4.8,and touch screens as well as software
34.92,4.5,programs or online services meant to
37.5,4.62,facilitate human to human communication
39.42,4.799,and learning are also included if you
42.12,3.48,have enjoyed the video so far we would
44.219,3.781,really appreciate it if you would

51.899,6.48,video HCI history human computer
55.26,5.52,interaction HCI has its roots in the
58.379,5.401,early days of computing in the 1950s and
60.78,4.739,1960s when scientists and Engineers were
63.78,4.14,the primary end users of the newly
65.519,5.761,developed Computing technology beginning
67.92,5.059,in the 1970s and 1980s researchers in
71.28,4.74,the field of human computer interaction
72.979,4.661,HCI recognize the need to find ways to
76.02,3.0,make computers more intuitive and
77.64,4.38,accessible to people with different
79.02,5.279,skill levels and learning styles HCI
82.02,4.26,development increased in the 1990s and
84.299,3.381,2000s due to the proliferation of
86.28,5.04,personal computers and the internet
87.68,5.74,computer science psychology sociology
91.32,3.6,and design are just few of the fields
93.42,4.62,that have contributed to the fields
94.92,4.98,increasing multi-disciplinary nature HCI
98.04,4.14,has developed further in recent years
99.9,6.359,with more attention being paid to mobile
102.18,5.939,devices wearable gadgets and vrar the
106.259,3.72,focus of the subject has shifted to the
108.119,3.901,development of accessible and inclusive
109.979,3.661,system designs that facilitate natural
112.02,4.76,and intuitive interactions between
113.64,3.14,humans and Technology
