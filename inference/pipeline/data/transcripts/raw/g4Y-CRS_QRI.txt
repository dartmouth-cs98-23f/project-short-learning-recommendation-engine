second,duration,transcript
0.0,2.639,none of us have worked on the questions
1.56,3.3,that we are talking about in system
2.639,3.66,design but look at this design
4.86,2.55,autocorrect
6.299,4.171,system
7.41,3.06,[Music]
13.08,3.9,hi everyone this is gkcs today we're
15.179,3.18,going to be talking about interviews for
16.98,3.299,software engineering
18.359,4.741,and at the end of this video you'll know
20.279,4.981,what those are and how you can prepare
23.1,4.019,based on what they are looking for
25.26,3.359,you're not trying to game the system
27.119,3.301,you're trying to understand the system
28.619,3.901,so that you can perform better and
30.42,5.1,articulate yourself better to give the
32.52,7.08,results that they are looking for
35.52,5.76,okay so let's start with the three major
39.6,2.52,parts of any software engineering
41.28,2.58,interview
42.12,5.58,the first one is a coding interview
43.86,6.359,coding is usually around algorithms and
47.7,5.82,data structures the second part is a
50.219,5.281,system design or architecture interview
53.52,2.94,earlier this used to be a technical
55.5,3.059,interview
56.46,4.56,the third part is the behavioral
58.559,4.8,interview it's also called The Profit
61.02,5.66,interview is this person fit
63.359,3.321,professional to join this company
67.02,7.139,the coding interview is
70.14,5.64,an IQ test okay largely an IQ test plus
74.159,4.081,basic skills
75.78,5.04,and we want to measure how smart you are
78.24,4.86,the second thing is system design or
80.82,7.619,technical interviews can the candidate
83.1,7.86,perform at the given position well and
88.439,5.401,here's the important part now
90.96,4.56,at this state in this situation can this
93.84,4.139,candidate perform well
95.52,5.04,at the given job role we are trying to
97.979,3.901,measure here skills
100.56,4.379,and the important thing is you need to
101.88,5.419,demonstrate these skills
104.939,5.521,in a IQ test there's also knowledge
107.299,4.78,which is tested finally we come to
110.46,4.38,behavioral interviews
112.079,6.781,the intent is to find out will a
114.84,7.099,candidate perform at the given role now
118.86,5.64,and later and what is being measured
121.939,4.72,motives of a candidate
124.5,4.619,what is the intent of the candidate when
126.659,5.16,he's sitting for this interview
129.119,4.801,okay so what kind of test mechanism
131.819,4.261,should we use for these three types of
133.92,3.36,interviews again you probably know about
136.08,3.239,this but I'm just trying to break it
137.28,3.24,down and see exactly what's happening in
139.319,3.481,each interview
140.52,5.04,if you take the coding interview as the
142.8,5.46,name suggests you are asked to solve a
145.56,4.319,problem do DSA do dynamic programming
148.26,5.22,you know Computer Science is based on
149.879,7.621,that problem solving is the mechanism to
153.48,5.52,test this skill what do you have with
157.5,3.239,system design
159.0,6.3,given a situation
160.739,7.14,design or code a solution finally you
165.3,4.38,have behavioral interviews your past and
167.879,4.681,maybe to some extent your current is
169.68,5.94,dissected to get your future your past
172.56,4.92,meaning around 18 months in the past
175.62,5.339,till date
177.48,6.18,tell us what situations you faced what
180.959,3.961,were particularly memorable or
183.66,2.82,challenging situations challenging is
184.92,4.2,usually memorable
186.48,5.16,give us those situations and then we
189.12,4.56,dive into what happened exactly what did
191.64,3.12,you do what did you think what did you
193.68,3.72,feel
194.76,4.559,and based on that we will not really
197.4,4.02,predict your future
199.319,5.041,but we'll assign you
201.42,5.58,a bucket okay so it's like hashing got
204.36,5.34,up into something or looking at his past
207.0,4.739,data points to predict his future in the
209.7,3.899,last 18 months he was working on a
211.739,3.42,startup one particularly challenging
213.599,4.741,part was when he was migrating his
215.159,5.94,entire database from zero code solution
218.34,4.08,to a engineering solution like an
221.099,3.06,in-house solution
222.42,2.94,and if you want a little more details
224.159,3.901,you can look at critical incident
225.36,4.32,interviews CII and what did you think
228.06,3.36,what did you feel sounds like a
229.68,2.94,structured interview star pattern is one
231.42,3.66,of the structured ways to talk about
232.62,5.339,this okay now let me talk about the pros
235.08,5.1,and cons coding algorithms
237.959,4.081,a lot of preparation before you sit for
240.18,3.18,an interview three months of preparation
242.04,3.96,definitely shows that you are interested
243.36,4.32,in this company what about fast helps
246.0,3.42,you go through hundreds of profiles
247.68,4.139,which would otherwise be waiting forever
249.42,5.16,it is its scalable absolutely questions
251.819,5.281,can be devised quickly put quickly
254.58,5.1,tested accurately and the best part is
257.1,4.919,the Judgment can be automated
259.68,5.04,judgment in practice
262.019,4.501,judgment in the interview can be taken
264.72,3.72,care of through an online judge
266.52,3.84,okay a remote code executor can tell you
268.44,4.56,whether your code runs correctly or
270.36,4.86,incorrectly it's an amazing feature of
273.0,4.8,coding interviews just coding interviews
275.22,4.979,that you are able to automate this
277.8,4.98,is it objective absolutely no one argues
280.199,4.261,that is it easy to set the syllabus yes
282.78,5.76,it is
284.46,7.019,just need some basic undergrad skills to
288.54,5.76,test a candidate on their binary search
291.479,4.801,it's it's like learning ABCD for a
294.3,3.72,computer engineer so you should know
296.28,4.5,about it
298.02,5.64,what about relevance to the job
300.78,5.88,there's some criticism to this criticism
303.66,5.4,but the fact is there is very little if
306.66,4.259,at all any relevance to your job role
309.06,4.44,and what happens in the interview for a
310.919,4.941,coding interview what about false
313.5,2.36,negatives
316.44,3.3,I would say this is a incorrect
318.18,3.54,criticism
319.74,3.72,false negatives means many people who
321.72,5.34,deserve to be on the job
323.46,5.1,are rejected because the test is
327.06,2.94,throwing them out
328.56,4.26,I would say
330.0,5.94,it has a lot of false positives also
332.82,5.4,people who join using the coding or
335.94,5.22,algorithms rounds
338.22,4.38,have little to no demonstration of
341.16,2.819,whether they can actually perform in the
342.6,4.14,role or not
343.979,4.681,in my experience around 10 to 20 percent
346.74,3.84,of the candidates are not good the
348.66,4.259,second thing is system design or
350.58,3.6,technical interviews the pros of this
352.919,3.541,especially the low level design
354.18,5.04,interview is that it is job relevant
356.46,4.86,let's see if there are any problems is
359.22,4.319,it automated no
361.32,5.4,so it's missing out on this thing it is
363.539,5.22,subjective so what you believe is good I
366.72,4.199,might believe is bad what you believe is
368.759,4.5,bad I might believe is good architecture
370.919,5.701,keeps going left and right
373.259,5.401,this becomes less and less true if you
376.62,3.96,have the second point
378.66,4.319,but the second point is a is a
380.58,3.899,requirement so it may not be true an
382.979,3.121,experienced interviewer needs to take
384.479,3.901,this let's say experienced a skilled
386.1,4.14,interviewer okay someone who is relevant
388.38,4.98,or knows about system design needs to
390.24,4.56,take this round so if a sd2 takes your
393.36,3.48,system design interview
394.8,4.56,take it with a pinch of salt I have seen
396.84,5.04,as the tools taking the interview of a
399.36,4.74,person who's sitting for a director role
401.88,3.96,and they end up asking them things that
404.1,3.0,they are never worked on none of us have
405.84,2.88,worked on the questions that we are
407.1,4.379,talking about in system design but look
408.72,3.96,at this design autocorrect
411.479,3.601,system
412.68,4.32,so the experienced person then says that
415.08,4.5,listen I'll probably start the queries
417.0,5.28,in different places fuzzy matching and
419.58,4.26,the person says the sd2 says you should
422.28,3.24,have thought of tries no
423.84,3.359,they're expecting some data structures
425.52,3.36,or some known Solutions
427.199,3.72,two unknown problems which have been
428.88,3.3,asked in 45 minutes and it's going to
430.919,2.821,test the candidate's ability to come up
432.18,2.579,with things without looking at Wikipedia
433.74,3.299,or Google
434.759,3.901,so you need a experienced or a skilled
437.039,2.761,interview to take this kind of an
438.66,4.979,interview
439.8,6.06,which is always in short supply even if
443.639,3.721,you have them they are busy working and
445.86,3.839,the cost of getting a skilled interview
447.36,3.779,out of their work and asking them to go
449.699,4.021,and interview all candidates which come
451.139,5.161,forward is very high one of the benefits
453.72,5.28,that you can go for again is that this
456.3,4.739,has a low false positive and negative
459.0,3.419,rate in the sense that if you see that
461.039,3.301,this person is good at what they do
462.419,4.381,there's a decent chance that they'll be
464.34,5.94,doing good at work also now comes
466.8,5.58,behavioral interview one is it has
470.28,3.84,High predictability
472.38,5.819,of whether a candidate will perform well
474.12,5.94,or not in a given job role when I say
478.199,4.681,predictability by definition means
480.06,4.919,future and it also says that is this
482.88,3.96,person actually interested in the job
484.979,4.021,is this person the kind of person who
486.84,4.02,does the job not that whether they can
489.0,4.86,do or not that whether they can learn
490.86,5.1,but whether they will do it is the false
493.86,5.839,positive rate high low
495.96,6.48,false positive rates or false negatives
499.699,4.06,are extremely low
502.44,2.28,after you have taken a behavioral
503.759,3.541,interview
504.72,5.28,one of the drawbacks of it is a person
507.3,5.46,who is skilled at behavioral interviews
510.0,4.8,Point number one it is subjective as
512.76,4.139,compared to a technical interviewer as
514.8,4.619,compared to a DSA interview it requires
516.899,3.961,a person to make a subjective call do I
519.419,3.06,mean that it is totally subjective
520.86,4.08,absolutely not
522.479,4.501,it is actually much more objective than
524.94,4.86,most of us Engineers give it credit for
526.98,3.6,there are ways in which you can grade a
529.8,3.539,person
530.58,5.759,right but that's the thing the grade is
533.339,4.741,being done by a human being where is
536.339,2.94,that subjectivity to it similar to a
538.08,2.64,system Design Round it was a good
539.279,3.361,solution it was a great solution it was
540.72,3.72,a bad solution is coming from the
542.64,4.68,engineer based on their experience of
544.44,3.959,what is good or bad or ugly just like
547.32,3.3,that you have a behavioral interview
548.399,3.241,subjective and again you need a skilled
550.62,3.0,interviewer
551.64,4.5,now comes the entire process don't look
553.62,4.74,at it as you know DSA is bad coding is
556.14,4.92,good coding is bad behavioral entries
558.36,4.74,are good no look at the full process
561.06,3.66,Google does not say if you clear this
563.1,3.9,round you're in it says that you have to
564.72,4.5,go through a googliness also and the
567.0,4.74,reason they do that is because or this
569.22,5.4,is my understanding of it is because you
571.74,5.039,need Engineers who are smart so they can
574.62,4.32,learn a vast number of topics as the
576.779,4.74,topography changes of software
578.94,3.6,engineering these people will perform
581.519,3.661,well
582.54,4.38,and they will perform probably grades
585.18,3.3,better than other people you know
586.92,2.82,because they can learn things quicker
588.48,4.32,and incorporate them into your
589.74,5.279,organization faster that's the idea so
592.8,3.84,this is amazing can this person learn
595.019,4.081,and is this person a good investment
596.64,4.259,moving forward
599.1,3.84,are they hard working yes absolutely
600.899,3.301,they have worked for three months just
602.94,4.079,to prepare for your interviews they are
604.2,6.78,dedicated to you know excelling at the
607.019,5.401,interview and these concepts are also
610.98,3.12,there's a there's a measurement of
612.42,3.359,knowledge also happening here you know
614.1,3.179,binary search does not just come to a
615.779,3.301,person while they're walking on the
617.279,4.321,street they they study these Concepts
619.08,4.68,and more and more deeper Concepts than
621.6,5.1,even by research
623.76,5.579,let me draw a timeline of what is the
626.7,3.6,value of an engineer okay as you go
629.339,4.261,ahead in your career your value
630.3,5.219,increases and what is the
633.6,4.2,time taken to give that value okay of
635.519,4.741,course this is a very subjective and you
637.8,3.96,know you can never measure people in a
640.26,3.66,straight line it's probably 10
641.76,3.84,Dimensions but whatever
643.92,3.18,so initially maybe your value zero maybe
645.6,2.7,even negative because you know you need
647.1,3.179,to be trained
648.3,3.96,after some time you go in a straight
650.279,4.081,path and you hit some time when you
652.26,4.56,actually become as useful as the money
654.36,4.32,you're taking your potential becomes
656.82,4.56,lesser than your kinetic
658.68,5.159,and then you keep scaling and now you
661.38,5.699,can probably go really high some people
663.839,4.981,are very relaxed people they don't want
667.079,4.981,to do software engineering they leave
668.82,5.34,here itself it's a loss to the company
672.06,6.3,and some people you know despite that
674.16,6.299,continue struggling reach her and maybe
678.36,3.24,taper off here saying that you know this
680.459,3.12,is
681.6,3.9,my potential I am not interested in
683.579,5.401,engineering or I will go into some other
685.5,5.04,role or I am happy with what I have I'm
688.98,5.28,not criticizing people I'm just telling
690.54,6.72,you this is roughly the space of value
694.26,5.34,or the the benefit that the company can
697.26,5.16,derive based on time now a person who
699.6,6.239,has high learning skills
702.42,5.4,is probably in this graph can be in this
705.839,4.021,graph is not in this graph but can be in
707.82,4.5,this graph so they have the potential to
709.86,4.26,be this line
712.32,3.18,a person
714.12,3.719,who's tested with a system design
715.5,3.66,interview you can tell roughly where
717.839,4.141,they are at
719.16,4.14,OK so you draw this line and you say uh
721.98,2.34,you know what the system design around
723.3,4.74,says they are somewhere over here
724.32,6.959,whether the person at this point chooses
728.04,6.479,this line or chooses this line is mainly
731.279,5.161,dependent on behavioral interviews
734.519,3.541,gaurav can be
736.44,5.459,an entrepreneur
738.06,5.459,gaurav will be an entrepreneur gaurav is
741.899,3.361,an entrepreneur are three different
743.519,3.841,questions
745.26,4.68,three different rounds
747.36,4.56,three different measurements the
749.94,5.28,important part is to see whether
751.92,5.159,what they can offer is what you need
755.22,3.78,that's something that I think most
757.079,3.901,startups forget
759.0,3.779,that's the reason why for most startups
760.98,5.52,the system Design Round is most relevant
762.779,5.461,and for most large organizations the
766.5,3.66,coding ground and the behavior round is
768.24,5.039,most relevant if you see for SD ones
770.16,5.1,even for SD tools large organizations
773.279,3.721,like Google Microsoft they don't ask
775.26,3.84,system design rounds right this is too
777.0,3.899,technical for you you're right now you
779.1,3.06,know pretty young but I need to know
780.899,3.0,where you are going
782.16,3.66,and I need to know
783.899,4.021,where you can potentially be
785.82,4.019,these two are pretty important as you
787.92,3.9,become more and more senior the
789.839,5.161,investment becomes more and more insane
791.82,5.639,so it becomes a challenge
795.0,4.38,to justify the cost immediately
797.459,3.18,also you need a starting point you need
799.38,3.36,to figure out where you are at like
800.639,3.481,almost everyone starts over here some
802.74,2.94,people are doing an internship role here
804.12,3.839,some people who have done maybe a job
805.68,3.659,beforehand or somewhere over here but as
807.959,3.361,you work more and more the system design
809.339,3.661,now becomes more and more reasonable so
811.32,3.3,this is the rough breakdown of a
813.0,3.54,software engineering interview process
814.62,3.0,when I say software engineering I don't
816.54,2.16,mean to say that it is just for
817.62,3.06,engineers
818.7,3.86,software developer and engineer is just
820.68,4.14,splitting hairs in my opinion
822.56,4.36,especially looking at the the kind of
824.82,4.079,work that they do front-end engineering
826.92,3.18,back-end engineering extremely similar
828.899,2.581,everyone goes through these kind of
830.1,2.88,rounds front-end engineering you have a
831.48,2.88,front-end engineering round which is
832.98,3.12,similar to a system design architecture
834.36,3.18,around for backend Engineers so this is
836.1,3.419,a technical interview okay low level
837.54,4.979,design you might think about Dev
839.519,4.5,operations developer operations which is
842.519,3.241,the infrastructure management of a
844.019,3.841,system so over there the system Design
845.76,3.319,Round is more focused on how do you
847.86,4.08,manage
849.079,4.841,deploying systems when you see a
851.94,4.5,software tester you look at how do you
853.92,4.14,test a given system or how do you let's
856.44,2.88,say write a small piece of code and then
858.06,2.88,start testing it focus more on the
859.32,3.3,testing angle of it but again a
860.94,3.54,technical interview whether you can do
862.62,5.76,testing or you can't do testing
864.48,7.74,okay behavioral interviews are Universal
868.38,6.12,IQ tests are Universal this is also
872.22,5.4,Universal but caters to the given job
874.5,5.88,role let's meet next time for another
877.62,6.5,round of software engineering breakdown
880.38,3.74,see you then soon bye
886.68,3.599,just think about it if you have dynamic
889.079,4.2,programming
890.279,5.101,in some situation and you say I will now
893.279,3.601,take this concept of dynamic programming
895.38,3.78,and make everybody do dynamic
896.88,4.139,programming and see who's good at it
899.16,2.88,you better be sure that in engineering
901.019,2.101,and software engineering dynamic
902.04,2.52,programming is the only thing that is
903.12,2.76,happening or that everybody needs to at
904.56,3.0,least use it
905.88,3.66,it's not true
907.56,5.399,I can take the same concept of dynamic
909.54,4.979,programming and put in something called
912.959,3.721,game AI
914.519,3.901,okay pick up any Concept in game AI
916.68,3.54,let's take something simple let's take
918.42,3.419,turn based games something you have
920.22,3.979,learned in college Alpha Beta pruning
921.839,4.44,okay it has something to do with trees
924.199,3.64,the trees there is some sort of
926.279,3.781,algorithm there is some logic required
927.839,4.62,some mathematical intuition has to come
930.06,4.5,a genius level intellect will then solve
932.459,4.081,the problem and you will be able to tell
934.56,3.48,whether the person's IQ is high
936.54,4.739,and you'll also be able to test some
938.04,4.68,knowledge and it is related to computer
941.279,4.261,science sufficiently related that you
942.72,5.4,can excuse yourself as an IQ test okay
945.54,4.44,but it is not asked
948.12,3.3,why
949.98,5.46,no reason
951.42,5.4,it is just a matter of fashion if this
955.44,3.42,is considered dynamic programming is
956.82,3.3,considered cool it will be asked if it
958.86,2.58,is not considered cool it will not be
960.12,3.86,asked
961.44,2.54,okay
964.019,5.76,security algorithms like RSA things that
968.04,3.78,you learn in college again people laugh
969.779,4.201,about it say that what's the point dude
971.82,3.959,this is never asked that is not the
973.98,3.479,fault of the college it is the fault of
975.779,2.821,the industry or it is not the fault of
977.459,3.0,the industry also they will do whatever
978.6,3.419,they like who are you to stop them
980.459,3.841,Frankly Speaking it's their money they
982.019,4.141,can do what they like but saying that
984.3,3.36,this algorithm is not very useful
986.16,3.66,because it's not asked in the industry
987.66,4.859,does not make any sense what I'm trying
989.82,4.74,to get you to think of is security
992.519,5.101,algorithms artificial intelligence
994.56,4.68,algorithms many algorithms which are in
997.62,4.5,data mining or data processing are not
999.24,4.68,asked not because they are not testable
1002.12,4.44,or they are not related to computer
1003.92,5.58,science it's just that
1006.56,5.94,nobody's interested in them right now at
1009.5,4.98,this point in time so this part of the
1012.5,3.72,test is the most volatile it keeps
1014.48,3.84,changing and you'll see courses on
1016.22,5.239,courses on DSA and data success
1018.32,3.139,algorithms keep coming up
1033.02,4.559,welcome to interview ready this platform
1035.48,3.42,is designed to help you upskill or
1037.579,2.521,prepare for your interviews as a
1038.9,3.0,software engineer
1040.1,3.3,it's designed for software Engineers
1041.9,3.72,having an experience range of something
1043.4,3.659,like 0 to 10 years so if you're a
1045.62,3.0,college undergraduate it may be a little
1047.059,3.24,too early for you and if you're more
1048.62,3.299,than 10 years of experience this could
1050.299,3.061,be good revision material but it's
1051.919,3.061,unlikely that you'll see the concepts
1053.36,3.179,over here which you have not seen in the
1054.98,3.78,real world already
1056.539,4.621,when we are talking about upskilling the
1058.76,5.1,focus of this platform is to pick the
1061.16,4.62,most important Concepts that a software
1063.86,4.26,engineer needs to know so that they can
1065.78,4.92,improve their workplace capabilities and
1068.12,4.799,improve their interview preparation
1070.7,4.08,also we take common interview questions
1072.919,4.441,which are asked across software
1074.78,4.08,companies to evaluate your skills
1077.36,3.12,there are three major differentiators
1078.86,4.26,when it comes to our product versus what
1080.48,4.439,is out there already one is that this is
1083.12,3.96,a lifetime valid course if you purchase
1084.919,3.661,it once it stays with you forever you
1087.08,3.66,can watch the videos as many times as
1088.58,5.28,you like retry the quizzes as many times
1090.74,5.34,as you like download the PDFs it's
1093.86,4.5,all yours once you purchase it
1096.08,3.9,our second feature is live classes where
1098.36,3.24,you can bring your doubts you can bring
1099.98,2.88,your suggestions you can bring some
1101.6,4.14,interesting system design questions
1102.86,5.52,which will be answering live we have a
1105.74,4.98,sample for you to look at
1108.38,5.82,our third feature is the content that we
1110.72,6.839,produce is highly curated and it is
1114.2,5.82,designed in a way that if you read one
1117.559,5.281,chapter you get to know the fundamental
1120.02,4.08,problems and solutions associated with
1122.84,3.36,that chapter
1124.1,4.5,for example once you go through the
1126.2,4.2,chest design you will know how
1128.6,4.38,connections are built in the real world
1130.4,4.019,on servers how that can be then extended
1132.98,3.72,let's say to
1134.419,3.721,a live Zoom class where multiple
1136.7,2.58,connections have to be maintained and
1138.14,3.659,you don't want those connections to be
1139.28,4.32,broken despite server restarts
1141.799,3.781,this is just one example
1143.6,4.56,each of our content pieces dives into
1145.58,3.66,detail on the fundamentals of Designing
1148.16,3.12,systems
1149.24,4.319,and our bonus feature is that we keep
1151.28,3.66,updating our content as you know the
1153.559,3.12,interview preparation space is very
1154.94,3.42,volatile what is popular today may not
1156.679,3.301,be popular tomorrow and interview
1158.36,4.74,questions change much faster than even
1159.98,5.4,Technologies so to stay up to date what
1163.1,5.1,we do is we add more and more content to
1165.38,5.94,the course and as you'll see some of the
1168.2,5.82,content is reordered and restructured to
1171.32,4.979,reflect on what the market demands are
1174.02,3.6,okay since your stayed so long I am
1176.299,3.841,assuming that you really want to know
1177.62,4.2,about what exactly is inside the course
1180.14,4.2,the course is largely broken into three
1181.82,5.16,sections one would be fundamentals where
1184.34,5.64,you understand the Deep Design Concepts
1186.98,4.559,which form the Bedrock of most popular
1189.98,3.18,systems
1191.539,4.02,the second is high level design where
1193.16,4.32,you see a 10 000 feet view a very high
1195.559,3.541,level architectural view of a
1197.48,3.78,distributed system popular questions
1199.1,4.199,being let's say Gmail popular questions
1201.26,4.62,being designing WhatsApp a calling
1203.299,4.681,application and so on
1205.88,4.5,and finally we have machine coding which
1207.98,5.34,is a very popular and upcoming
1210.38,5.58,type of interview used to evaluate a
1213.32,4.739,candidate's coding skills their testing
1215.96,5.88,skills and their system design skills
1218.059,5.881,when it comes to actually programming
1221.84,3.0,so that's the three sections we have in
1223.94,3.119,our course
1224.84,5.12,I look forward to you joining all the
1227.059,2.901,best see you soon
