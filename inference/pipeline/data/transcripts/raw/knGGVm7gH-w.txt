second,duration,transcript
6.1,4.93,so my name is Sevilla I'm the head of
9.019,5.4,the human-computer interaction study
11.03,6.03,program Italian University and together
14.419,5.191,here is also my colleague Sonya who will
17.06,5.129,do the introduction for interaction
19.61,4.44,design and also Andreas so both of them
22.189,4.111,are managing the interaction design
24.05,4.799,master's program and also our students
26.3,4.95,gabriela Inchon who will give you a
28.849,4.021,little brief personal introduction about
31.25,5.059,their study experience
32.87,6.75,ok so I'll try to share my screen now
36.309,5.981,and we'll go through the through the
39.62,7.109,presentation so I hope everything works
42.29,10.71,nicely I'll try to go fullscreen so that
46.729,9.091,everyone can see ok so I hope that you
53.0,4.14,can see the slides if not please let me
55.82,6.96,know but I really hope everything is
57.14,10.01,working and briefly to introduce the HCI
62.78,6.93,study program to you so in the
67.15,5.95,human-computer interaction study program
69.71,5.79,will emphasize technology for the
73.1,4.769,benefit of people that's our kind of
75.5,5.07,tagline that's our model and that's
77.869,9.03,that's how we try to also approach
80.57,8.31,things on a day to day basis and what
86.899,5.941,are we about we focus on three main
88.88,6.779,things our master's program is very much
92.84,5.849,research driven it's informed by our
95.659,7.02,latest state-of-the-art research that we
98.689,7.35,do within our group and that's that's
102.679,6.21,why I also most of our teachings most of
106.039,4.47,the also the lectures most of the
108.889,3.061,classes that were organized most of the
110.509,4.1,material that we share with our students
111.95,5.909,is not from the book it's from our
114.609,5.47,ongoing state-of-the-art research that's
117.859,3.54,something you cannot kind of go to a
120.079,6.451,library and read about that's something
121.399,7.441,that we share with you on our fresh
126.53,4.32,experience we focus on new and emerging
128.84,4.5,technology so we'd like to think of
130.85,4.62,ourselves as working on things that will
133.34,3.9,only become commercially available or
135.47,4.2,mainstream in five to ten years so
137.24,4.8,that's also kind of
139.67,5.78,of the our focus areas that's what we
142.04,5.76,have tried to do to play with
145.45,5.74,technologies that will only go
147.8,5.22,mainstream in the future and we're also
151.19,4.379,very much theory based and reflective
153.02,6.26,which again I guess feeds back to this
155.569,6.511,research driven approach so most of the
159.28,5.41,discourse that we have in the various
162.08,6.12,sessions in the various modules is based
164.69,5.7,on theory we want to engage in hands-on
168.2,3.869,activities in the design process we'd
170.39,3.36,like to be very much reflective and
172.069,4.651,critical about what we do and how we put
173.75,5.519,together and what values we use so I
176.72,5.099,think it kind of these three things
179.269,5.161,these three facets permit very much what
181.819,6.901,we do in the program if we look into the
184.43,5.76,background of the students that you
188.72,4.049,might eventually encounter in the
190.19,4.92,program then it's a very diverse because
192.769,5.94,the the field of HCI is also very
195.11,6.99,diverse so I try to point out four main
198.709,5.37,areas of where people come from to study
202.1,5.07,with us it's mainly computer science
204.079,4.44,design psychology and anthropology but
207.17,3.21,they're also kind of surrounding
208.519,4.651,disciplines such as economics and human
210.38,4.8,factors sociology language semiotics
213.17,6.12,engineering so it's a very mixed crowd
215.18,5.91,of people some with more engineering or
219.29,3.93,more technical background some more the
221.09,4.56,more artistically design-based
223.22,4.44,background some from social behavior
225.65,4.32,scientists so different understandings
227.66,6.199,different schools of thought different
229.97,6.03,approaches to design research and
233.859,6.041,technical foundation and we put all of
236.0,9.569,you on all of them together to make cool
239.9,10.32,stuff happen let's see
245.569,6.14,oops sorry so how our our studies
250.22,4.799,organize how would they go about
251.709,5.051,approaching things well we go through
255.019,4.141,several stages of theory or several
256.76,4.879,different types of activities from
259.16,4.5,emphasizing and researching to defining
261.639,3.611,the problem statement through
263.66,3.78,constraints and guidelines and then
265.25,4.26,ideation and brainstorming and then
267.44,4.14,modeling and prototyping testing and
269.51,4.2,evaluating finally publishing and
271.58,3.75,producing so
273.71,4.23,in the course of the study she would
275.33,4.32,cover the whole range from from
277.94,5.64,contextual acquiring and background
279.65,5.22,research to creating or defining the
283.58,3.51,design challenge or the problem
284.87,3.99,statement and finding solutions
287.09,4.11,exploring alternatives how to implement
288.86,4.53,things and then evaluating with users
291.2,6.6,assessing and finally producing the
293.39,7.2,final outcome the course overall the
297.8,4.65,program is is a two-year program four
300.59,3.9,semesters and this is how it's mainly
302.45,4.29,structured in the main category so if
304.49,4.5,some of you have already looked into the
306.74,5.21,more formal program description then you
308.99,4.86,might see that we start with
311.95,5.05,university-wide courses which is like
313.85,8.72,confrontation and the course that we
317.0,7.32,have there is them is the mmm
322.57,4.51,interdisciplinary course that we run
324.32,4.62,throughout the university so all you can
327.08,4.47,interact with people from all sorts of
328.94,4.86,backgrounds and programs from out the
331.55,4.47,university and then there's a set of
333.8,3.96,harmonization courses so depending on
336.02,5.66,which background you come from either
337.76,6.78,design or technical background or maybe
341.68,4.59,social behavioral sciences we will look
344.54,5.13,into what skills you're missing either
346.27,5.23,design or programming development or
349.67,5.13,both and then you get the chance to get
351.5,6.69,those skills and also there's an
354.8,5.76,intensive foundations section which
358.19,5.22,teaches you a lot about the theoretical
360.56,5.82,landscape of HCI the different research
363.41,6.21,methods that we use and how to go
366.38,4.65,putting together your initial research
369.62,3.81,proposal for your masterpiece
371.03,6.78,then there's a set of core courses and
373.43,5.85,then to selection modules either on
377.81,3.27,shaping experiences or in shaping
379.28,2.49,Society depending on which way you want
381.08,3.54,to go either
381.77,5.1,focusing or the micro or the macro level
384.62,4.53,of designing interactions and then
386.87,5.34,there's training either through
389.15,4.74,internship or training abroad and a set
392.21,3.24,of electives that where you can choose
393.89,4.26,from a set of different courses that we
395.45,5.1,offer to kind of create your own a
398.15,5.28,unique profile and path and then finally
400.55,4.5,we wrap off the course with a master
403.43,4.77,thesis project which is kind of project
405.05,5.79,you work on on a selected topic with
408.2,4.32,your supervisor to build very nuanced
410.84,6.66,and detailed expertise on a certain area
412.52,9.39,that of your interest so on the next
417.5,6.63,slide assignment it opens you will see
421.91,7.43,the breakdown of the different courses
424.13,9.56,throughout throughout the semesters so
429.34,7.99,like I mentioned the program is a four
433.69,4.99,semester long two year course in the
437.33,4.62,first semester we start with this
438.68,4.56,harmonization or we call them up to kind
441.95,3.96,of getting your skills up to date
443.24,4.26,basically courses then there's a set of
445.91,3.39,foundational courses which lasts for the
447.5,4.41,first year
449.3,6.3,core courses are the core courses to the
451.91,7.319,HCI curriculum mainly focusing on kind
455.6,5.43,of the foundations of HCI and also this
459.229,3.391,shaping experiences shaping Society
461.03,5.31,module which is kind of you can choose
462.62,5.22,which path you want to go through in the
466.34,3.78,second semester II also take this
467.84,4.139,university-wide courses then the third
470.12,3.78,semester is what we call our mobility
471.979,3.75,window so it's either you take a set of
473.9,5.01,selective's or you actually can choose
475.729,5.071,to go abroad on an Erasmus exchange to
478.91,3.27,study in a different University in a
480.8,2.85,different country and the fourth
482.18,6.93,semester is actually devoted to the
483.65,7.89,masterpiece so this is roughly how you
489.11,5.88,your studies could pan out over the four
491.54,5.4,semesters and you can see here a more
494.99,3.87,detailed view of how these courses are
496.94,5.37,organized similar to what I was showing
498.86,6.119,to you before so the Foundation's
502.31,4.59,organization shaping experiences anxiety
504.979,3.781,electives that you can take in the first
506.9,3.36,semester in the second semester will
508.76,3.839,mainly focus on an integrated project
510.26,3.78,which is a very hands-on activity which
512.599,3.691,where you go exactly through this
514.04,4.14,process of coming up with a design
516.29,4.53,challenge or researching the background
518.18,3.81,and then finishing off with a working
520.82,2.43,prototype that has been thoroughly
521.99,3.66,tested with users
523.25,3.87,finally in the first semester you go for
525.65,3.57,this kind of studies abroad or
527.12,3.63,internship in a company free electives
529.22,5.22,and then you finish up with the master
530.75,5.82,thesis okay so to tell you more about
534.44,4.31,the mast it is because that's again
536.57,5.99,related to this research driven part
538.75,7.11,of our studies we try to go for either
542.56,5.22,applied or basic research so you can do
545.86,4.05,a hands-on project developing or
547.78,4.68,designing something or you can actually
549.91,4.92,go for basic research and go maybe in
552.46,4.59,more to theory building and creating
554.83,5.82,different models we usually go for a
557.05,6.26,dual supervision model because we try to
560.65,5.58,go for thesis topics that are very much
563.31,5.86,multidisciplinary so bringing in or
566.23,5.73,combining several different areas of
569.17,5.13,expertise and we frame them within our
571.96,4.47,current research things which are for I
574.3,5.04,won't go through too much detail on that
576.43,5.4,we have these topics also posted on our
579.34,5.43,website but we work across four main
581.83,6.75,areas design theory and methodology user
584.77,5.49,experience neurophysiology and body
588.58,5.16,centric computing so some of these are
590.26,5.55,overlapping and complementary and
593.74,4.83,depending on where your heart lies
595.81,4.29,closer to the most you can choose and
598.57,3.6,position yourself within one of these
600.1,4.2,topics and what you can see here on the
602.17,5.22,slide are some subtopics that kind of
604.3,4.74,try to illustrate what this work within
607.39,4.71,one of these larger areas could be about
609.04,4.5,so all of our students eventually need
612.1,3.96,to position themselves and their mass
613.54,4.799,that is within this within these four
616.06,6.62,topics or with within one of these four
618.339,4.341,topics okay so
622.89,6.39,we also have a very nice infrastructure
626.13,5.76,to support our activities we have in our
629.28,5.82,school in our Institute we have five
631.89,6.12,labs but we're mainly using the first
635.1,4.35,three ones most of our activities are
638.01,3.75,based on the interaction design lab
639.45,4.92,where we go into kind of this we have a
641.76,4.23,space an open space which facilitates
644.37,3.6,all of these different conceptualization
645.99,4.23,and from the Taiping activities and then
647.97,5.06,there's a companion smaller lab to it
650.22,6.36,where we run controlled lab experience
653.03,5.92,using different equipment that I'll show
656.58,4.83,you in a moment and then we also use the
658.95,7.5,harbor lab where we mainly go into body
661.41,7.47,centric and yeah own own body computing
666.45,3.99,we also have the software lab and game
668.88,4.08,lab which also some where students use
670.44,6.0,but may need these three ones um that I
672.96,6.42,kind of highlighted here okay so some of
676.44,3.84,the tools that we use we go from
679.38,3.3,paper-based
680.28,7.53,to very hands-on microcontroller and
682.68,6.99,electronics materials we go and explore
687.81,4.49,different types of devices and different
689.67,5.43,types of modalities from wearables to
692.3,5.32,virtual reality to touchscreens to
695.1,6.33,motion sensors and game based
697.62,8.43,interactions to physiological computing
701.43,8.49,such as eye tracking emotions emotional
706.05,6.53,state tracking to finally tapping into
709.92,5.6,your brain and actually looking into how
712.58,7.06,your brain reacts to certain things
715.52,7.21,react to stimuli reacts to interactions
719.64,5.07,that are being kind of designed and also
722.73,4.05,how you in can interact with the system
724.71,4.41,through your brain so kind of this goes
726.78,4.65,both ways so as you can see a whole
729.12,4.23,range of different materials and devices
731.43,3.63,and equipment that we use all of this is
733.35,7.14,available in the labs that I mentioned
735.06,8.13,to you before and finally we also have
740.49,5.7,different kind of testers or flavors of
743.19,5.04,our arm of the courses that we teach in
746.19,5.58,the program in different formats one of
748.23,4.71,them the most maybe the oldest and one
751.77,3.03,of the more mature one is the
752.94,3.81,experimental interaction design course
754.8,5.25,where we actually go into a two
756.75,6.38,intensive process of conceptualizing
760.05,4.98,designing and prototyping Bodhi centric
763.13,3.9,interactions and pieces just some
765.03,4.89,examples with students coming with
767.03,4.21,necessary no design or development
769.92,3.56,background and in two weeks building
771.24,4.32,working prototypes with Arduinos and
773.48,5.23,microcontrollers so this is just a
775.56,6.51,glimpse of what we do in just two weeks
778.71,4.92,you can read more about it either on the
782.07,2.97,summer school or winters covariant
783.63,4.68,because we're on this course twice a
785.04,5.76,year we also run the annual world
788.31,5.19,visibility the event which I think the
790.8,4.95,last edition it happened took place on
793.5,7.53,November 22 in the town and critic hub
795.75,7.65,and it's it brought together on 500
801.03,4.83,people from the Baltics and maybe in
803.4,5.43,countries such as Finland Russia Sweden
805.86,7.19,people come from all the region to join
808.83,6.89,for this one they full event of of
813.05,6.96,conferences and presentations and also
815.72,6.76,an accompanying two or three days of
820.01,4.06,hands-on workshops so this is kind of an
822.48,4.14,also very big event that we're hosting
824.07,6.51,every year and you can read more about
826.62,7.98,this here on the website would Dottie
830.58,7.65,world usability day don't eat and I
834.6,5.34,think that's it that's what briefly I
838.23,4.95,wanted to tell you about the program I'm
839.94,6.81,exactly 15 minutes so I'm on time and
843.18,6.99,I'll hand it over to Sonya Andreas okay
846.75,5.16,Thank You Leah and I would like to
850.17,6.57,welcome everyone to this information
851.91,8.09,session first and I will be introducing
856.74,3.26,you the interaction design
860.36,8.43,can you just tell me when to switch so
865.92,6.15,basically this muscle is offered since
868.79,6.61,2016 it's a hundred percent online study
872.07,6.15,program it's run in English it's a joint
875.4,4.939,problem so it's run in cooperation
878.22,4.59,between two universities Tala
880.339,5.101,universities where I'm the head of the
882.81,6.15,program and Cyprus University of
885.44,4.089,Technology where andreas pathologies the
888.96,4.169,head
889.529,8.04,the program so we we have two heads
893.129,7.32,thank you for this program the game of
897.569,6.18,the master basically similar to the HCI
900.449,5.55,master stood educate and train students
903.749,5.971,who have a strong interest interest in
905.999,7.861,the interaction design also we emphasize
909.72,9.109,technology from the benefit of people so
913.86,4.969,in terms of position can you switch
919.519,7.92,position this this master it has it has
927.529,7.03,been created from from an existing
932.759,5.7,program that is human-computer
934.559,7.02,interaction and it overlaps also with
938.459,6.54,this problem some of the the courses and
941.579,5.3,also some other courses are together
944.999,4.59,from South Wales University of
946.879,5.591,Technology and that experience in this
949.589,5.341,in this problem so you can see here that
952.47,4.95,it kind of overlaps in this in this
954.93,4.969,sense Tallinn University and psychedelic
957.42,6.57,University and gains from this both
959.899,5.011,universities experiences but the next
963.99,6.149,one please
964.91,9.13,so in terms of her fields and our areas
970.139,7.2,we we prime the computer science the
974.04,7.849,business and the design area so all of
977.339,10.411,this overlapped a little bit here about
981.889,9.7,the program so in the it's the same as
987.75,6.99,the HCI program so four semesters to two
991.589,5.25,years course in the first semester fall
994.74,5.069,semester that runs from September until
996.839,5.79,December we have a set of foundation
999.809,6.181,courses core complementary courses and
1002.629,6.45,practice and specialization the all of
1005.99,5.099,them are compulsory so foundation
1009.079,4.771,courses are like courses like design
1011.089,4.381,Theory methodology research methods
1013.85,4.229,foundations of human-computer
1015.47,5.839,interaction the cold horses are like
1018.079,5.221,courses like interaction design methods
1021.309,4.78,complementaries prototype
1023.3,5.1,and practice and specialization is
1026.089,6.36,individual subjects where we invite
1028.4,6.57,students to select a set of individual
1032.449,4.551,subjects to study that they would like
1034.97,6.959,to complement in that problem
1037.0,7.959,the next during spring from January to
1041.929,5.25,June we also have some set of core
1044.959,5.281,courses complementary courses and
1047.179,5.281,practice and specialization so the core
1050.24,4.83,courses here are development of
1052.46,5.93,interactive systems user experience
1055.07,6.84,evaluation fuel research methods in HCI
1058.39,5.85,the complementary are current topics in
1061.91,5.37,human interaction in human-computer
1064.24,5.98,interaction Universal Design the
1067.28,6.12,practice is it's basically a practice
1070.22,7.49,course where you invited to do practice
1073.4,8.31,about the interaction design thank you
1077.71,9.76,on semester three and semester for
1081.71,9.75,second year so fall and spring we have a
1087.47,7.47,set of core courses - and the foundation
1091.46,6.08,courses so in semester three so the
1094.94,5.43,course is the interaction design project
1097.54,5.139,where you put in practice everything
1100.37,4.83,that you learn on the first first year
1102.679,6.151,and the foundation course is your master
1105.2,7.02,to the seminar where you are helped to
1108.83,7.89,set up the main research problem and to
1112.22,7.949,guide you to - to who - throughout the
1116.72,8.82,second the second the semester for that
1120.169,8.64,is the master thesis notes so this is
1125.54,5.91,more or less what what it is the
1128.809,7.201,distribution of courses throughout the
1131.45,7.05,fall semester so we are poor horses
1136.01,8.76,master disease foundation courses and
1138.5,9.929,practice and specialization courses mood
1144.77,6.75,of the liver so everything is online we
1148.429,7.591,use mainly Google tools Google Apps and
1151.52,5.039,Google classroom we have a combination
1156.02,3.659,of
1156.559,6.031,and synchronous communication it's
1159.679,5.191,mainly synchronous we have a couple of
1162.59,6.27,synchronous communication at least one
1164.87,6.21,or two per course but it depends on the
1168.86,5.49,course content and the mode of the
1171.08,7.589,lecture the deliver of the assignments
1174.35,6.929,and and the projects are bi-weekly so
1178.669,4.291,you will set you will have a set of
1181.279,6.0,assignments every two weeks
1182.96,7.38,the assessed test is a assessment is
1187.279,5.941,based highly and in the assignments and
1190.34,6.089,project work at the end of the semester
1193.22,6.689,we invited you to present verbally in
1196.429,9.48,the synchronous session and exam neutral
1199.909,14.281,the the course we are starting this this
1205.909,10.441,program in September 2020 so as I was
1214.19,4.559,saying throughout the years of
1216.35,6.329,experiences offering this course both
1218.749,5.971,face-to-face and online we we believe
1222.679,4.47,that we need to limit the number of
1224.72,5.069,students so this this online course has
1227.149,5.22,a small number of students because we
1229.789,7.171,want to mentor in a mentoring students
1232.369,6.81,one maybe and want one advising we also
1236.96,4.169,want to make it flexible because the
1239.179,4.95,main target of students are the ones
1241.129,5.461,that are working students so that's why
1244.129,5.52,we offered the course to be then to be
1246.59,6.059,run as part-time or full-time if you are
1249.649,5.37,if you do it a part-time you will do to
1252.649,5.22,more or less an average of three courses
1255.019,6.77,per semester if you know what this whole
1257.869,3.92,time you'll do six courses per semester
1262.96,7.12,regarding the lectures and students so
1267.95,5.849,these are the set of lectures for
1270.08,9.36,Tallinn University Ilya sonja and david
1273.799,7.95,llamas and elections from the cycles
1279.44,6.51,University of Technology andreas
1281.749,6.991,Alexandra's and Panna cottas of course
1285.95,5.48,we have additional extra support but
1288.74,6.0,these are the main lecture
1291.43,9.01,regarding the students we have a unique
1294.74,9.48,and multinational set of students so we
1300.44,5.97,have three students joining us from 36
1304.22,4.7,different countries and you can see the
1306.41,5.76,set of countries here the total of
1308.92,6.37,students that we have right now it's 98
1312.17,8.63,and by the end of this year we expect
1315.29,5.51,wealth 21 students finishing the program
1322.66,5.74,so if you want to know more about it you
1325.34,7.02,are some testimonials here that you can
1328.4,8.31,go and read about it but Shawn will will
1332.36,8.19,also be here to kind of present her his
1336.71,7.77,view of the problem he's finishing this
1340.55,9.36,semester so he has a lot of things to
1344.48,8.4,say to you yeah okay so that's it from
1349.91,5.73,my side thank you thank you so much for
1352.88,4.38,you so now we first invite capella to
1355.64,4.05,maybe share some of your experiences
1357.26,4.98,Gabrielle is from Brazil originally but
1359.69,4.86,now living in Estonia for almost one
1362.24,4.23,year and studying with us in the HCI
1364.55,5.48,master's program so maybe completely can
1366.47,3.56,say a couple of words think I need to
1373.24,6.97,hello can you hear me yep loud and clear
1376.85,7.13,yeah so thank you for the introduction
1380.21,7.95,in it so yeah I'm Ella I'm originally
1383.98,6.01,from Brazil I'm a something that at
1388.16,4.02,first that was I thought I would not
1389.99,4.23,really fit in the human-computer
1392.18,4.23,interaction program because I'm from the
1394.22,5.79,from Committee I have a background in
1396.41,6.03,communications but yeah as either
1400.01,7.14,explained it's a very interdisciplinary
1402.44,7.11,course it's been really a very nice
1407.15,6.66,experience so far we have a very mixed
1409.55,5.76,group so the same way that I'm I'm from
1413.81,3.84,communication I have people from
1415.31,7.35,psychology people from computer science
1417.65,6.389,and design order yeah order other
1422.66,4.67,backgrounds and it's
1424.039,7.401,really good because we can really
1427.33,7.51,discuss from different perspectives how
1431.44,5.919,how to move on with technology so I
1434.84,4.799,think one of the the first things that
1437.359,4.8,he mentioned that we the goal of the
1439.639,4.051,program is to create technology for the
1442.159,5.041,benefit of people I think that that's
1443.69,8.969,really that's really what we discuss
1447.2,7.799,here we have a lot of critical we
1452.659,5.97,develop a lot of critical thinking on on
1454.999,6.15,the topic and also have the chance to
1458.629,5.16,have some hands-on experiences so now
1461.149,5.15,I'm I'm finishing the first year so we
1463.789,4.801,are actually still engaged in this
1466.299,6.19,integrated project and it's been a lot
1468.59,8.669,of work really in in developing
1472.489,6.81,something so unfortunately we couldn't
1477.259,5.34,use all the resources that we have in
1479.299,5.31,the lab that he also presented we had
1482.599,6.9,the chance to use some in the previous
1484.609,6.75,semester but we managed to do everything
1489.499,3.6,online but it's nice you know like
1491.359,5.76,everything is really there we can really
1493.099,6.06,use and I think one of the things that I
1497.119,4.44,would like to highlight is that all the
1499.159,5.64,teachers from from the beginning of the
1501.559,7.021,program the program they're very open to
1504.799,5.46,discussions and to to really hear and
1508.58,5.0,what people have to say and helping you
1510.259,8.311,out to develop the ideas that you have
1513.58,9.099,so yeah I think I think it's a good way
1518.57,7.5,or it's a very good program regardless
1522.679,7.2,or for different objectives so I'm
1526.07,6.029,really more into this conceptual I'm
1529.879,5.76,interested in this conceptual area of
1532.099,6.06,how to how to make better technology so
1535.639,4.86,I think that's that's really interesting
1538.159,4.08,for me but I see that also people who
1540.499,5.971,are more into developing and creating
1542.239,7.201,they also have been learning and growing
1546.47,6.329,a lot in their practice and of course I
1549.44,8.44,also managed to develop my skills on
1552.799,7.211,that considerably so yeah I think
1557.88,4.919,that's that's what they can say so far
1560.01,5.52,also overall about University it's been
1562.799,4.591,I mean it's not very big
1565.53,5.34,University I think it's a good size so
1567.39,8.039,we have enough space we have this art
1570.87,6.179,this lab that we can use it's very very
1575.429,5.041,helpful it's a place where we can
1577.049,6.411,actually make contact with the teachers
1580.47,7.05,with other students from other ears so
1583.46,8.74,it's it's very good for the development
1587.52,9.09,of our skills okay thank you so much
1592.2,6.3,Gabriela so now maybe Shawn can share
1596.61,7.23,some of these experiences into online
1598.5,10.64,masters please okay hi Mary one for
1603.84,9.719,Singapore so I come from a background in
1609.14,9.519,art and computer science slam a door or
1613.559,11.011,a designer developer so I guess what
1618.659,8.071,made me want to do the program is it
1624.57,7.29,would be nice to have a formal grounding
1626.73,7.22,in designing for computer things so
1631.86,6.51,that's why I did it
1633.95,7.39,I guess most of you guys will be will be
1638.37,5.789,like me working professional so after a
1641.34,7.41,while design principles everything they
1644.159,7.171,get they become intuitive so the whole
1648.75,5.039,way the course was delivered I mean you
1651.33,5.07,get it every two weeks you have an
1653.789,6.451,assignment and it's more or less
1656.4,7.2,practical so if it works for me it is
1660.24,5.8,not it is stressing me out phonetically
1663.6,4.55,that much because I'm not so good
1666.04,5.3,[Music]
1668.15,7.42,timewise he was great as well because
1671.34,8.42,I'm in Singapore and they are over in
1675.57,6.2,Estonia so the really deliver a
1679.76,5.169,synchronously
1681.77,6.01,that's good for me so why do is I
1684.929,6.271,finished what then I do my assignments
1687.78,5.73,then we return in and then we get
1691.2,4.26,back and then at the end of everything
1693.51,7.889,you do the presentation again module
1695.46,8.76,went on we know what else can I see over
1701.399,5.041,all the lectures are great they know
1704.22,19.98,what they're doing really so yes and as
1706.44,19.949,they yeah maybe maybe you could mention
1724.2,3.479,just briefly your experience with
1726.389,6.931,working with colleagues from all over
1727.679,7.681,the world so yeah that is good to be
1733.32,4.469,honest a lot of the people you'll be
1735.36,5.699,working with a really experienced so we
1737.789,4.62,had we had Joe who was idea UX I keep
1741.059,4.22,telling them was like sanguine I was
1742.409,6.63,above me so it's just really inspiring
1745.279,9.88,inspiring to see what we are I'm Wanda
1749.039,9.901,was only senior management and his is
1755.159,11.191,overall quite a good experience I would
1758.94,10.739,say yeah it's great it's great I like
1766.35,5.37,you thank you so much John so maybe some
1769.679,5.041,some of our participants will have
1771.72,10.65,questions for you later on so be ready
1774.72,11.4,to answer those yes what is your reason
1782.37,6.74,for studying and what do you want to
1786.12,2.99,achieve with this
1794.81,5.74,yes Arielle's muted so well I didn't
1799.32,2.66,mention before that I'm from
1800.55,6.21,communications but I used to work with
1801.98,8.08,advertising so my initial motivation it
1806.76,7.92,was actually to try to move to the UX
1810.06,8.91,field - I sort of in Brazil it's not
1814.68,5.88,such a formal field and I wanted to get
1818.97,4.89,some formal education that would
1820.56,5.64,actually put me closer to that so that
1823.86,4.98,was my initial goal that's why I started
1826.2,5.64,but now I'm really interested in I'm
1828.84,6.86,getting more involved into this more
1831.84,6.93,theoretical research side of
1835.7,6.19,human-computer interaction so now I'm
1838.77,6.3,considering maybe trying to focus more
1841.89,7.32,on research and maybe following a bit
1845.07,7.29,further in city academic life so I'm not
1849.21,6.26,sure yet but I feel like I I get I'm
1852.36,9.2,getting enough skills to to follow both
1855.47,6.09,paths if I decide later
1866.52,4.5,so Shawn has already touched upon this
1868.98,4.35,although in the format of the online
1871.02,6.69,studies and the face-to-face studies are
1873.33,6.45,similar so it's bi-weekly courses we
1877.71,5.67,need every Wednesday Thursday and Friday
1879.78,5.31,so you need to plan for full days from
1883.38,5.91,morning till evening it's roughly I
1885.09,6.03,guess six hours of classes six to eight
1889.29,3.96,hours depending how intensive that they
1891.12,3.57,will be and then you have two weeks in
1893.25,4.08,between to work on your assignments
1894.69,5.31,either individually or in group the labs
1897.33,6.78,as Gabriela mentioned are open to
1900.0,6.66,students 24/7 so usually you can apply
1904.11,4.32,for a student pass and then you can go
1906.66,4.38,and work in the lab so whenever you want
1908.43,5.16,to if you prefer early morning or late
1911.04,4.38,at night or on the weekends it's totally
1913.59,4.77,up to you so it's it's whenever the
1915.42,5.34,university is open it's almost open all
1918.36,4.86,the time throughout the year I think you
1920.76,8.19,are welcome to come at your own time at
1923.22,7.95,your own schedule and and work here you
1928.95,5.85,also wanted to entertain your online
1931.17,7.29,course usually we set the deadline on
1934.8,6.3,Tuesdays so you have the weekend to also
1938.46,5.13,to work on your assignments so you
1941.1,8.79,expect to deliver something something in
1943.59,8.25,the end of the day of Tuesday's okay so
1949.89,3.6,finally someone asks the question we
1951.84,4.32,have been open waiting for what about
1953.49,7.05,Kovac and what do we do about studies in
1956.16,6.15,in autumn so the answer is that we don't
1960.54,2.97,have an official answer yet we're
1962.31,3.42,actually waiting for that from the
1963.51,5.31,studies department but of course when
1965.73,4.68,I've been talking about it for the
1968.82,3.66,online masters is not a problem because
1970.41,7.95,it's all online for the face-to-face
1972.48,7.74,masters I think and this is kind of not
1978.36,3.99,the official statement yet but that's
1980.22,4.05,something that we're planning to do at
1982.35,4.38,the moment is to go with blended model
1984.27,5.34,studies so those who are able to come
1986.73,5.01,here to Estonia for the beginning of the
1989.61,4.77,school year are more than welcome to
1991.74,6.0,come hopefully the health situation we
1994.38,5.94,will be allowing us to to actually meet
1997.74,6.419,face to face is there kind of in
2000.32,6.63,vacations of that and those of you who
2004.159,5.431,for different reasons won't be able to
2006.95,6.319,come by September will be able to join
2009.59,6.27,online in our session so we will have
2013.269,4.721,kind of a parallel schedule of online
2015.86,5.1,sessions to complement our face-to-face
2017.99,4.64,study so maybe and kind of doing group
2020.96,5.73,work presentations you'll be joining in
2022.63,6.399,online together with our face-to-face
2026.69,5.19,students and and contributing and
2029.029,4.591,participating in that I guess like you
2031.88,3.96,saw from the presentation of the online
2033.62,4.35,masters we have extensive experience of
2035.84,4.62,teaching both face-to-face and online so
2037.97,6.409,it shouldn't be much of an issue of
2040.46,3.919,going with this blended mode of studies
2046.21,6.63,it's similar to the hei so it's a much
2049.53,9.42,disciplinary program it's not we don't
2052.84,9.57,demand so high it's so high
2058.95,6.01,developing and programming skills so our
2062.41,5.07,level of programming on online master is
2064.96,5.22,lower than the other face-to-face but
2067.48,5.16,the skills are multidisciplinary so you
2070.18,4.86,can can come from different fields and
2072.64,6.6,you will work together and you'll shed
2075.04,8.25,experience regarding this yeah I hope
2079.24,6.81,that I managed to answer my question
2083.29,6.6,yeah maybe I can just comment on that as
2086.05,6.51,well because the the development course
2089.89,4.22,was I was teaching it before so what
2092.56,5.52,we're planning for the new additions to
2094.11,5.53,actually have a full support for you to
2098.08,3.84,get you started started with kind of
2099.64,3.84,basics of developments and to teach you
2101.92,3.36,how to actually put stuff together so
2103.48,5.58,we'll walk you through the process that
2105.28,6.33,will be materials there will be full
2109.06,4.98,support so that by the end of the day
2111.61,3.96,you can actually make stuff happen even
2114.04,5.61,if you don't have the technical skills
2115.57,6.33,so I think it should be quite nice of
2119.65,5.67,course we expect some technical skills
2121.9,6.81,we're doing with with all necessary
2125.32,5.82,tools for for learning online by
2128.71,6.48,computer using the internet but this is
2131.14,5.94,the basic ones yeah yeah true okay so
2135.19,5.21,emma is asking about the programming
2137.08,3.32,skills for HCI masters
2142.21,4.75,again Sonya already touched on it the
2144.74,4.68,the background of students degree mixed
2146.96,5.46,it's very multidisciplinary and that's
2149.42,6.23,why we also offer this harmonization
2152.42,5.28,courses mmm the harmonization course for
2155.65,4.9,programming skills is called end-user
2157.7,5.94,computing and it fits nicely it starts
2160.55,5.43,in the per semester and fits nicely into
2163.64,4.44,the development of interactive systems
2165.98,4.11,in the second semester so you go from
2168.08,3.99,the full range of kind of really basics
2170.09,5.45,of programming to putting more complex
2172.07,6.6,stuff together like Android applications
2175.54,6.49,eventually also getting introduced to to
2178.67,5.49,Arduino and microcontroller so you'll
2182.03,4.1,get the full support so the only thing
2184.16,4.68,that we ask from you is kind of
2186.13,5.35,motivation and interest to get started
2188.84,5.19,with this even if you don't have the
2191.48,4.68,background being open and being willing
2194.03,5.51,to learn new stuff and then we'll kind
2196.16,3.38,of walk you through the whole process
2201.18,5.48,so
2203.18,7.11,it's it's mainly of of we have a little
2206.66,9.36,in Italian University we have a bit more
2210.29,9.48,credit so we will run it's a program
2216.02,7.56,that it's 51% from Tallinn University
2219.77,7.77,and 50% from Cyprus university of
2223.58,6.05,technology so it's 1% more from Tallinn
2227.54,2.09,University
2232.18,8.02,so well so far I've been I chose to
2237.11,5.24,dedicate only to studies now but several
2240.2,5.82,of our class of my classmates are
2242.35,7.92,already working or already found
2246.02,7.74,something so there are several several
2250.27,6.97,startups and companies in in Estonian I
2253.76,6.48,haven't really researched much in the
2257.24,6.15,other Baltic countries but I I believe
2260.24,8.4,that it's quite similar I think overall
2263.39,7.08,in this HCI field either four more to
2268.64,5.13,the side of programming and computer
2270.47,7.38,science and also for the side of design
2273.77,7.2,there's quite a good demand I would say
2277.85,6.92,there's there's people needed likes cute
2280.97,8.0,people needed in this regard so it's I
2284.77,7.6,seek good opportunities there there are
2288.97,5.77,possibilities to work there also even
2292.37,6.27,within the university sometimes we get
2294.74,8.43,contacted about opportunities for for
2298.64,7.32,work or for projects so yeah overall I
2303.17,8.16,would say there it's promising field
2305.96,9.08,here yeah and it's also a challenge for
2311.33,7.11,us teaching stuff because our students I
2315.04,5.17,go start working either by then the
2318.44,3.57,first semester by the end of the first
2320.21,4.32,year and then we need to chase them so
2322.01,4.29,it's a challenge we're kind of happy
2324.53,5.34,that they can find a job but also not
2326.3,5.52,happy when they get distracted with the
2329.87,6.51,job and not focusing on their studies so
2331.82,8.16,that's kind of it's it's it's kind of
2336.38,4.83,two sides to the coin so but I would say
2339.98,3.66,in general there are good opportunities
2341.21,4.11,in Estonia maybe not immediately in the
2343.64,5.91,first semester but as you start getting
2345.32,5.4,some hands-on skills then experience
2349.55,3.09,shows that by the end of the first
2350.72,5.1,academic year most of the students can
2352.64,5.04,get a job maybe on a slightly lower
2355.82,4.92,level initially but then gradually
2357.68,6.03,progressing to higher levels to
2360.74,4.93,eventually some of our aluminized having
2363.71,6.19,very nice positions are in the
2365.67,6.179,in the IT IT sector in Estonia so most
2369.9,3.81,of them aren't and working its and then
2371.849,4.051,it's like a Braille I said it's your
2373.71,4.26,decision whether you want to kind of not
2375.9,3.48,work deliberately because you want to
2377.97,3.45,focus in your studies or you want to
2379.38,6.08,combine some house orders I think there
2381.42,4.04,are good opportunities eventually
2386.98,5.32,we are two types a to two types of
2390.71,4.29,Admissions we have a documentation
2392.3,5.22,admissions where we go throughout all
2395.0,5.01,the documents that you submit and we
2397.52,4.8,assess you in base of the documents and
2400.01,5.28,then we do an intervention an interview
2402.32,5.82,admission so this is the test that maybe
2405.29,5.67,we are talking about Ilya
2408.14,5.28,this isn't it from hgi point of view
2410.96,4.74,yeah so there's a process that you need
2413.42,4.56,to submit it's it's your CV motivation
2415.7,5.73,letter and portfolio and then we in the
2417.98,5.58,admissions interview we spent half an
2421.43,5.4,hour pre each candidate actually meeting
2423.56,6.96,you online synchronously and then we
2426.83,6.96,kind of go over your interests we ask
2430.52,4.38,you about eventually the the topic that
2433.79,5.28,you would like to work on for your
2434.9,5.52,master thesis your skillset some
2439.07,5.36,projects that you have worked on in the
2440.42,6.48,past and yeah we try to assess kind of
2444.43,4.15,your plans and your motivations for the
2446.9,4.73,future so that's that's basically what
2448.58,3.05,the admissions is all about
2454.03,7.21,well for designers we really go very
2457.64,5.1,deep into the methodology and theory of
2461.24,4.02,design the different theoretical
2462.74,5.61,frameworks how to systematically
2465.26,4.74,approach the design process and of
2468.35,3.81,course also the technical side of things
2470.0,4.44,so if you're lacking the technical
2472.16,5.25,skills then we would first expect you to
2474.44,5.01,invest more into learning the basics of
2477.41,5.79,programming how to put stuff together so
2479.45,5.04,that eventually this integrated project
2483.2,3.87,that Gabriela mentioned that she's now
2484.49,4.11,working on with our colleagues in the
2487.07,3.51,second semester in Spain you would be
2488.6,5.79,ready to actually actively contribute to
2490.58,5.94,building stuff so that's that's kind of
2494.39,5.12,the learning curve that you as designers
2496.52,2.99,would go through
2502.04,8.829,what I did was I was studying full-time
2506.369,8.161,and I took the program full time as well
2510.869,7.911,so it definitely can be done but I think
2514.53,7.35,what most of the other students did is
2518.78,7.45,they took three modules and then they
2521.88,7.02,they worked at the same time so it's
2526.23,5.609,really up to you to judge how much know
2528.9,5.31,you can handle I guess but it can be
2531.839,4.981,done I did full time work and I did full
2534.21,7.23,time studies hope that answers a
2536.82,8.13,question we also advise students to to
2541.44,5.909,try and see how much courses they can
2544.95,4.83,handle they can start with three
2547.349,4.891,enrolling three courses and then if they
2549.78,4.47,feel that they can handle a little bit
2552.24,4.95,more than then the next semester they
2554.25,5.4,can enroll in four or six it depends on
2557.19,5.82,them the same the other way also works
2559.65,6.419,so if you feel that you cannot manage
2563.01,5.79,the workload and now you cannot let us
2566.069,4.651,know and you can reduce the amount of
2568.8,4.67,courses that we enrolled in the and the
2570.72,2.75,next semesters
2577.0,6.51,the courses are mainly fall semester are
2579.52,6.15,based in HCI although in some cases we
2583.51,3.66,have intensive courses for lasting for
2585.67,4.82,one or two weeks but these are mainly
2587.17,5.76,exceptions normally the courses last for
2590.49,4.3,14 weeks that's the length of the
2592.93,5.15,semester but which means that we will
2594.79,6.9,have an average of seven to eight
2598.08,7.18,contact sessions so one session every
2601.69,6.86,two weeks so this is the average
2605.26,3.29,schedule for the courses
2610.8,5.28,to clarify as well that for the online
2613.619,5.521,mastery any interaction design you don't
2616.08,5.58,need to submit a portfolio you can but
2619.14,4.95,it's not obligatory so for those who
2621.66,4.67,would like for the online master they
2624.09,6.95,need to submit their their CV
2626.33,4.71,just to clarify yeah
2633.42,4.02,for the h-hi for the face
2635.04,4.14,face you need to submit the city the
2637.44,4.14,motivation later and the portfolio so
2639.18,4.43,three things that's that's the main
2641.58,2.03,difference
2646.91,5.129,if you have any more questions to
2650.089,4.141,follow-up please send them over this
2652.039,7.441,link that made it is shared with you
2654.23,8.119,till till you dot e / n / en / as an
2659.48,2.869,English / ask
2667.47,5.7,thank you for coming yes thank you all
2670.68,5.42,for being available and hope to see you
2673.17,2.93,soon one of these days
