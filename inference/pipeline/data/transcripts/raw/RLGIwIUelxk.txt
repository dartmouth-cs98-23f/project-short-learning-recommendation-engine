8.8,5.759,hello and welcome to this session on sql
12.16,4.64,server tutorial
14.559,5.601,today we are going to talk about
16.8,5.76,sql server what benefit it provides
20.16,5.119,and some queries and some
22.56,7.76,sql syntaxes which will help you
25.279,7.761,understand how to use sql queries
30.32,5.52,now let's see what's in it for us today
33.04,5.039,we will discuss what is sql server
35.84,4.64,the usage of sql server
38.079,4.081,different sql server editions and the
40.48,4.399,differences between them
42.16,4.48,and then what are the advantages of sql
44.879,4.401,server instances
46.64,4.079,and after that i'll show you execution
49.28,4.24,of some queries
50.719,5.201,some insert statements on the sql server
53.52,5.359,instance which i have installed
55.92,5.279,now what is sql server in any
58.879,4.48,application development today in any
61.199,5.28,computer application which we develop
63.359,5.281,database sql server plays a very
66.479,5.041,important and pivotal role
68.64,4.24,sql servers are used for persistence of
71.52,4.48,information
72.88,4.16,in your database which can be retrieved
76.0,3.36,mined
77.04,4.56,data mined or you can query it at a
79.36,5.92,later point of time
81.6,4.879,the benefit of having any sql server is
85.28,3.76,that data
86.479,3.841,is persisted in a structured
89.04,4.96,efficient
90.32,6.4,manner so that it can be retrieved later
94.0,5.6,quickly and meaningfully
96.72,5.359,so sql server is a relational database
99.6,5.76,management system in which you can
102.079,5.921,create tables two-dimensional tables
105.36,5.68,and connect them using referential
108.0,5.759,integrity like primary key foreign key
111.04,4.24,and other kind of integrity constraints
113.759,2.801,you can maintain in this relational
115.28,4.64,database
116.56,6.159,sql server is developed and marketed by
119.92,4.799,microsoft so this is a microsoft product
122.719,3.76,but it is compatible with all the
124.719,4.561,technologies which you want which you
126.479,6.241,might be using or you might want to use
129.28,5.52,like node.js java etc where you want to
132.72,5.2,connect your middleware
134.8,4.48,application server with microsoft sql
137.92,4.64,server
139.28,5.2,now what is the usage of sql server
142.56,3.84,apart from the
144.48,4.399,definition which i just shared with you
146.4,5.839,for maintaining and building databases
148.879,6.321,persistent databases there are other
152.239,6.08,usages also which i'll explain you
155.2,6.48,now the first one is sql server analysis
158.319,6.241,service which is used to analyze data
161.68,6.48,now the sql server analysis service or
164.56,4.48,ssas is a multi-dimensional analysis
168.16,3.12,tool
169.04,5.12,that features online analytical
171.28,6.0,processing provide powerful data mining
174.16,5.04,capabilities and deeper dimensions to
177.28,3.44,business information within a relational
179.2,5.2,database
180.72,6.239,multi-dimensional analysis is an online
184.4,3.6,analytical processing technique olap
186.959,3.601,technique
188.0,5.36,that produces the ability to analyze
190.56,5.92,large quantities of data by storing data
193.36,4.4,in access and cells instead of
196.48,3.92,traditional
197.76,4.24,relational two-dimensional view in rows
200.4,4.4,and columns
202.0,5.36,ssas places predictive analytic
204.8,5.12,capabilities in the hands of information
207.36,5.04,workers by creating an instant
209.92,4.56,connection to backend data using
212.4,5.68,familiar applications such as microsoft
214.48,7.28,excel sharepoint etc for analysis visual
218.08,5.04,representation and collaboration
221.76,3.839,the next is
223.12,4.56,sql server reporting services which is
225.599,5.36,used to generate reports
227.68,5.839,now ssrs is a framework of reporting
230.959,5.28,mechanisms such as the report builder
233.519,5.761,report designer report manager and
236.239,5.521,report server that work together through
239.28,5.2,a web interface to enable the
241.76,5.52,development of concise interactive
244.48,4.24,reporting solutions in print or web
247.28,4.159,format
248.72,5.36,report builder and report designer are
251.439,3.921,two ssrs components for generating
254.08,3.679,reports
255.36,4.879,report builder is a simple solution for
257.759,4.961,the information worker or business user
260.239,4.801,to create quick reports without the need
262.72,3.6,to understand the core structure of the
265.04,3.439,data
266.32,4.96,the report designer is a tool for
268.479,4.961,developers because it adds complexity to
271.28,4.16,custom reports development and you
273.44,3.68,create data models in it
275.44,3.039,using this tool requires an
277.12,4.079,understanding of the business
278.479,4.241,intelligence development studio shell in
281.199,3.44,visual studio
282.72,5.12,and the underlying structure of the data
284.639,5.84,so you have to be aware of it thoroughly
287.84,5.6,according to microsoft the report server
290.479,5.681,is the core process engine in ssrs that
293.44,5.6,manages the processing
296.16,5.44,and delivery of reports using processors
299.04,5.28,the report manager is an administrative
301.6,5.28,tool that controls reporting services
304.32,4.96,through a web interface
306.88,4.8,now let's talk about another important
309.28,5.759,component which is sql server
311.68,6.16,integration services ssis which is being
315.039,4.72,used to perform atl operations extract
317.84,4.88,transform load
319.759,4.801,now ssis is the data warehousing arm of
322.72,5.199,the sql server
324.56,6.0,equipped with superior extract transform
327.919,5.12,and load capabilities etl
330.56,4.88,it provides the vehicle for moving data
333.039,5.361,from different data sources to another
335.44,5.599,and changing the data if necessary the
338.4,4.16,three components in the ssis platform
341.039,2.481,for starting the data integration
342.56,4.639,process
343.52,7.36,are the import and export wizard ssis
347.199,5.921,designer and ssis api programming
350.88,4.8,the import and export wizard simply
353.12,4.639,transfer data from source to destination
355.68,5.28,but does not include data transformation
357.759,5.361,capabilities it's the ssis designer is
360.96,3.28,an integrated component of the business
363.12,3.68,intelligence
364.24,4.399,development studio used for the
366.8,4.48,development and maintenance of
368.639,5.921,integration service packages
371.28,6.08,ssis api programming module allows you
374.56,5.04,to code ssis packages using any number
377.36,3.839,of programming languages so there are a
379.6,3.68,lot of features which are available to
381.199,3.921,you in order to
383.28,4.0,manage your data create your data
385.12,4.4,pipeline structure it
387.28,5.039,build visualization reports
389.52,5.76,perform etl operations etc so it's an
392.319,4.401,entire solution enterprise solution
395.28,4.24,now let's see what are the different
396.72,4.96,kind of sql server editions microsoft
399.52,5.119,provides five additions with various
401.68,4.32,tools and services and pricing options
404.639,3.84,as per the needs
406.0,4.8,so enough two editions of sql server
408.479,5.681,which are free of charge are sql server
410.8,6.08,developer and sql server express
414.16,5.68,now the developer sql server edition
416.88,5.28,works and function exactly like an
419.84,4.16,enterprise sql edition the only
422.16,4.64,difference is the license is used for
424.0,4.639,testing and development purpose only
426.8,3.679,this addition is generally used by
428.639,4.161,developers to build and test
430.479,4.961,applications on top of the sql server
432.8,5.839,but they can't take it to the production
435.44,6.24,sql server express edition now is the
438.639,5.921,free entry level database version and is
441.68,4.72,ideal for learning and building desktop
444.56,4.56,and small server data driven
446.4,4.239,applications but not meant for any
449.12,4.0,serious computation
450.639,4.96,while also having incredibly limited
453.12,2.479,features
456.319,4.561,now the other additions are used for
458.88,5.439,commercial purposes
460.88,5.68,sql server web edition
464.319,5.361,it is a low total cost of ownership
466.56,5.759,option for web hosts and web value ad
469.68,4.32,providers to provide scalability
472.319,3.761,affordability and manageability
474.0,4.72,capabilities for small to large scale
476.08,5.28,web properties
478.72,5.28,as the sql server enterprise edition
481.36,5.279,delivers comprehensive high-end data
484.0,5.759,center capabilities with blazing fast
486.639,4.881,performance unlimited virtualization and
489.759,2.641,end-to-end business intelligence
491.52,3.359,enabling
492.4,5.04,high service levels for mission critical
494.879,3.681,workloads and end user access to data
497.44,3.439,insights
498.56,4.8,this version has all the features
500.879,5.121,required for big data
503.36,4.88,now sql server standard edition this
506.0,3.759,delivers basic data management and
508.24,4.0,business intelligent database for
509.759,4.72,departments and small organizations to
512.24,4.799,run their applications and support
514.479,4.961,common development tools for on premise
517.039,5.92,and cloud enabling effective data
519.44,6.48,management with minimal i.t resources
522.959,5.041,now let's look at some advantages of sql
525.92,4.479,server instances
528.0,4.24,its installation is of different
530.399,4.241,versions on one machine you can maintain
532.24,4.08,different installations the maintenance
534.64,4.16,of production development and test
536.32,5.28,environments can be done separately
538.8,4.96,you can maintain a standby server
541.6,4.32,so installation is streamlined it can be
543.76,3.36,installed via setup wizard and the
545.92,3.52,prerequisites
547.12,4.32,updates are detected and downloaded by
549.44,4.16,the installer automatically
551.44,4.8,the complexity of the installing the
553.6,4.4,software is minimized significantly
556.24,2.96,because of automatic installation of
558.0,3.2,updates
559.2,4.0,other components such as analytical and
561.2,3.759,database services can be installed
563.2,3.68,separately afterwards
564.959,6.481,automatic updation also reduces
566.88,8.16,maintenance costs quite significantly
571.44,5.92,sql server 2008 uses policy management
575.04,5.12,to detect security policies that are not
577.36,4.56,compliant so this feature allows only
580.16,4.64,authorized personal access to the
581.92,6.56,database security audits and events can
584.8,6.4,be written automatically to log files
588.48,4.96,ms sql server has built-in transparent
591.2,4.8,data compression feature also along with
593.44,5.04,encryption users don't need to modify
596.0,5.92,programs in order to encrypt the data
598.48,5.039,the ms sql server has access controlled
601.92,2.96,coupled with efficient permission
603.519,3.281,management tools
604.88,4.079,further it offers an enhanced
606.8,4.4,performance when it comes to data
608.959,4.0,collection
611.2,4.079,okay and
612.959,4.721,coming to the cost reduction so it has
615.279,4.56,lower cost of ownership sql server
617.68,5.12,includes effective data management and
619.839,5.361,data mining tools along with disk
622.8,5.12,partitioning your server's optimum
625.2,4.8,maintenance can be ensured by following
627.92,3.44,effective data management practices
630.0,3.36,these practices
631.36,4.64,also help you ensure the availability
633.36,5.28,and recoverability of data choose from
636.0,5.6,over 300 in-demand skills and get access
638.64,5.28,to 1 000 plus hours of video content for
641.6,4.16,free visit scale up by simply learn
643.92,3.039,click on the link in the description to
645.76,4.16,know more
646.959,4.081,now let's move on to
649.92,2.0,creating
651.04,4.0,a
651.92,6.72,database in sql server
655.04,5.6,so i have installed the default sql
658.64,5.199,express on my machine
660.64,3.199,and now i'm gonna
664.88,4.92,create a database called sql tutorial
690.64,5.439,so let's create a database called sql
694.079,4.801,underscore
696.079,2.801,tutorial
701.839,4.961,okay
703.839,4.56,now i will write certain queries on top
706.8,5.44,of it
708.399,6.321,first i'll create a table
712.24,4.719,customers let's create a table customers
714.72,3.679,which has columns customer id which is
716.959,2.56,its primary key
718.399,4.241,the name
719.519,4.161,which has where care customer id is in
722.64,3.68,age
723.68,3.599,which is an integer gender male female
726.32,4.0,will
727.279,5.521,notified with one character address
730.32,5.199,which is generally a large num string
732.8,6.24,value so we'll keeping it back at 20
735.519,5.841,item which is varchar 15 and price okay
739.04,5.96,so let's
741.36,3.64,create this table
749.279,5.281,okay so now if you see this table has
751.44,4.959,been created dbo dot customers now all
754.56,4.88,the relevant columns which i created
756.399,3.841,here has been present
759.44,1.92,now
760.24,3.92,i have
761.36,4.8,prepared a script to insert
764.16,4.479,some sample values
766.16,2.479,so that
769.36,4.159,we can
771.519,3.44,query this so i have inserted around
773.519,2.721,about 20
774.959,3.12,values
776.24,4.159,so let's just check
778.079,3.841,whether my data is present i'll do a
780.399,3.44,select star
781.92,4.96,from my customer table and you can see
783.839,4.481,now the 20 rows with the customer id
786.88,3.28,customer name
788.32,2.88,age gender
790.16,2.799,address
791.2,3.439,the item which the customer has
792.959,4.0,purchased and the price at which he has
794.639,3.601,purchased
796.959,3.601,now
798.24,4.64,let me show some variations of the
800.56,4.64,queries which we can perform
802.88,3.92,now select star means you have selected
805.2,4.48,all the columns
806.8,4.8,i only want to select some
809.68,2.88,selective columns like customer name and
811.6,3.039,gender
812.56,4.88,so i can also do that you just need to
814.639,6.88,give the name of the
817.44,5.44,customer and the gender column
821.519,2.721,next query
822.88,3.84,i want to check
824.24,5.36,what is the distinct values of the
826.72,5.119,gender in my customer table
829.6,4.0,so i will only get two values which is
831.839,4.081,male and female so there is no other
833.6,5.84,value apart from m and f
835.92,3.52,in my customer table
839.68,5.36,next i have a query where i want to find
843.12,4.159,which all are the customers who have
845.04,4.32,purchased an item who all are the
847.279,4.481,customers who have purchased an item
849.36,3.52,which is having price greater than 250
851.76,4.319,rupees
852.88,6.079,okay great so out of 20 only 12 other
856.079,4.88,customers who have purchased a price
858.959,2.961,item which is greater than 250 and you
860.959,3.521,can see
861.92,5.76,all the items which are listed over here
864.48,3.2,are greater than 250.
868.48,4.159,next
869.519,4.56,okay i want the customers who are living
872.639,2.481,in new york
874.079,3.2,okay
875.12,4.56,fine i just have to change the where
877.279,5.521,clause where instead of the price i am
879.68,6.159,now looking at the address which is in
882.8,3.039,new york
886.639,4.161,now it is also possible that you can
889.76,3.28,apply
890.8,4.479,another filter okay
893.04,3.919,people living in new york but age is
895.279,4.24,greater than 28
896.959,3.44,perfect i only have two customers who
899.519,2.32,are
900.399,3.521,living in new york
901.839,4.641,but
903.92,3.44,having age greater than 28
906.48,2.0,or
907.36,4.719,i want
908.48,7.039,the female customers who are purchasing
912.079,5.041,items greater than 380 rupees okay only
915.519,4.56,one out of 20
917.12,2.959,okay elena
920.16,3.84,now
921.279,4.721,we saw examples of and condition

926.0,5.76,want female customers or customers who
929.519,5.601,are greater than age 30 so you will get
931.76,5.519,both the records age greater than 30 or
935.12,3.76,female customers both the records will
937.279,4.081,come
938.88,6.079,or
941.36,5.12,customers who are in chicago or
944.959,3.521,purchasing
946.48,5.68,items greater than 420. so these are the
948.48,3.68,examples of or conditions
952.56,6.16,now let's take another example of not
955.839,3.92,now i want that the customers who are
958.72,3.679,not
959.759,5.2,purchasing price less than 650 the
962.399,4.161,reverse right greater than 650 so i'll
964.959,2.641,get this answer
966.56,4.0,or
967.6,5.2,i want the customers who are not living
970.56,4.48,in new york apart from new york
972.8,4.159,any other address so all these customers
975.04,4.479,are there okay
976.959,4.481,so now these are the examples which i
979.519,4.24,showed you are the examples where you
981.44,4.8,can play around you can filter data
983.759,5.281,applying the where clause
986.24,5.839,now let's take another example of
989.04,5.039,aggregated functions in sql
992.079,4.081,now amongst the list of customers the
994.079,4.0,data set of customers which i have i
996.16,6.08,want to know what is the minimum age of
998.079,6.401,my customer well minimum age is 18 years
1002.24,3.92,so one the minimum age amongst the all
1004.48,3.599,the customers is 18
1006.16,4.96,and the maximum is
1008.079,7.12,i can just change it to max
1011.12,8.48,is 61. so the age range of my customers
1015.199,4.401,who are purchasing are from 18 to 61.
1021.759,4.001,okay now another example hypothetical
1024.799,4.961,example
1025.76,7.439,i want the average age of my customers
1029.76,6.079,where customer id is greater than 105
1033.199,4.161,okay so if you see
1035.839,4.641,select star
1037.36,5.599,where customer id is greater than 105 i
1040.48,4.24,have 15 customers and amongst these
1042.959,5.6,my average age
1044.72,3.839,of my customers is 35.
1049.12,6.48,similarly instead of average i can take
1052.64,4.24,the sum total of the
1055.6,7.28,age
1056.88,6.0,above 105 which is 539 sum total okay
1064.84,5.079,now
1066.64,5.76,i'll show you an example of like
1069.919,4.961,i want the name i want the customers
1072.4,5.84,list where addresses
1074.88,6.0,which consist of e letter e in their
1078.24,5.679,address it anywhere in the string
1080.88,3.919,beginning in the middle because i have
1083.919,4.0,like
1084.799,5.841,is a keyword like percentage first e
1087.919,4.0,percentage means e can come in any part
1090.64,4.279,of the string
1091.919,3.0,okay
1095.36,4.72,and if i just change this example
1097.84,3.12,i remove the percentage from here it
1100.08,2.88,means
1100.96,4.4,that i want the customers whose
1102.96,4.24,addresses end with e so only pune will
1105.36,4.48,come into the picture okay
1107.2,2.64,so
1111.679,5.36,so this is the difference
1114.24,6.08,now coming select star from customers
1117.039,5.681,where age which between 20 and 30 so i
1120.32,5.28,want all the customers which have belong
1122.72,5.68,to age between age 20 and 30 inclusive
1125.6,4.88,so 20 and 30 both are inclusive so it
1128.4,4.56,means the customers which with age 20
1130.48,5.48,and all 30 will also come in this result
1132.96,3.0,set
1136.16,3.92,next example i want the count of total
1138.32,5.04,customers in my
1140.08,6.8,uh data set which is 20 i inserted 20 so
1143.36,8.48,i know now i have 20
1146.88,8.32,i want the count of male customers
1151.84,5.04,oh out of 20 19 are male okay great
1155.2,5.92,and if i
1156.88,4.24,group by now let's see an example of
1162.64,3.52,group by
1163.76,4.64,so i want
1166.16,4.16,the count of customers grouped by
1168.4,4.32,address so how many are living in boston
1170.32,5.28,how many in chicago detroit miami new
1172.72,4.64,york and pune so i have a customer wise
1175.6,4.48,total count total
1177.36,4.319,bases the address group by okay so it's
1180.08,4.56,a very important concept you can group
1181.679,5.841,by any column and then you can do a
1184.64,5.36,measure count account or sum an average
1187.52,4.24,you can do any aggregated calculation
1190.0,4.32,basis the other columns which are not in
1191.76,4.88,the group by
1194.32,3.28,unlike another example i want an average
1196.64,3.039,age
1197.6,4.0,per address so in boston the average age
1199.679,5.921,of my customer is 34 who are purchasing
1201.6,5.6,items chicago 35 pune 43. so like that
1205.6,4.48,you can do some analysis this is all
1207.2,2.88,data analytics
1210.96,5.36,now let's see another example
1213.44,5.52,i want to i want to filter data now
1216.32,4.32,after doing a group by it's not so
1218.96,4.0,please note this is different from where
1220.64,4.24,clause in where clause means filtering
1222.96,4.079,data before grouping
1224.88,4.32,having clauses used once you want to
1227.039,4.401,filter data after grouping
1229.2,4.88,so you are doing group by address count
1231.44,4.4,of customers and then only those cities
1234.08,3.04,should come where count is greater than
1235.84,2.959,two okay
1237.12,3.919,so the customers
1238.799,3.921,the only those addresses are listed
1241.039,4.921,where customers count is greater than
1242.72,3.24,two okay
1248.799,4.561,now this is an example of
1251.679,3.521,inner queries
1253.36,4.64,you want
1255.2,6.0,group by customer name and age
1258.0,6.0,only those customers having age greater
1261.2,4.88,than the average age of overall okay so
1264.0,5.76,my average age
1266.08,5.92,if i say my average age
1269.76,4.799,from customers is 36
1272.0,4.32,so overall all the customers which are
1274.559,3.761,more than 36 should come over here
1276.32,4.56,listed over here and that's what has
1278.32,2.56,happened okay
1285.76,3.76,now
1287.28,4.16,let's talk about order by it's like
1289.52,4.72,sorting
1291.44,7.28,you want to order by address so it has
1294.24,5.2,ordered by by default b c d m n p which
1298.72,2.079,is
1299.44,2.479,ascending
1300.799,2.161,and if you
1301.919,2.481,apply
1302.96,4.88,keyword descending
1304.4,6.639,so it will do the reverse way
1307.84,4.959,similarly i can order by age
1311.039,3.441,which is descending higher stage first
1312.799,2.88,lowest below
1314.48,4.8,or
1315.679,4.48,you can do order by multiple columns
1319.28,2.8,where
1320.159,4.161,order by address descending and then
1322.08,4.4,same address within the same address the
1324.32,4.239,customers should be ascending so
1326.48,4.4,addresses are descending but within the
1328.559,7.761,address the customer names are sorted in
1330.88,5.44,ascending fashion a first bcd like that
1342.08,4.56,now there is an inbuilt function in sql
1344.24,4.319,server reverse if you see this has
1346.64,6.399,reversed the name
1348.559,5.36,of the customers it's in reverse fashion
1353.039,3.361,okay
1353.919,4.561,the characters are reversed
1356.4,4.56,another example is
1358.48,4.88,where you are now this is not on the
1360.96,5.199,table this is just a sample query where
1363.36,4.24,you are replacing vegetable with fruit
1366.159,3.601,so orange is a fruit so you have
1367.6,4.4,replaced vegetable with the fruit it is
1369.76,4.159,just uh you don't need a table you can
1372.0,3.679,just also write such queries where you
1373.919,3.201,don't need a table
1375.679,3.441,okay
1377.12,4.4,then there is a function called ltrim
1379.12,3.439,which is which will remove all the
1381.52,2.159,blanks
1382.559,3.36,from the
1383.679,4.561,left hand side
1385.919,5.12,r trim which will remove the blanks from
1388.24,2.799,the right hand side
1393.28,3.519,okay let me read an r trim
1395.44,3.84,it will remove the
1396.799,5.441,blanks from the right hand side and then
1399.28,4.879,there is trim function which will remove
1402.24,4.559,from both the sides
1404.159,2.64,left and right
1408.4,4.8,now let's take an example of update
1410.559,6.561,command i want to update the name of my
1413.2,4.959,customer whose customer id is 103.
1417.12,1.919,first
1418.159,4.681,let's
1419.039,3.801,check what's the name
1438.559,3.761,the customer name right now is ripple i
1440.72,2.72,want to change it to
1442.32,3.44,smith
1443.44,6.16,and if i read query it is changed to
1445.76,5.76,smith okay so this is an example of
1449.6,4.559,update
1451.52,5.759,now if i want to delete let me check who
1454.159,5.681,is at 101 i want to delete customer101
1457.279,5.041,joseph i will delete it
1459.84,5.839,and now if i want to check okay there is
1462.32,3.359,no customer at one zero one
1466.72,4.72,okay now let's take one other example
1469.44,4.0,this is like another example of inbuilt
1471.44,4.479,function as sky it will give you the
1473.44,4.16,ascii code of the character
1475.919,5.36,ascii a
1477.6,5.84,sky 4 etc etc right
1481.279,3.921,so there is n number of
1483.44,4.32,possibilities there is n number of
1485.2,4.16,queries which you can write but
1487.76,3.76,this is just a glimpse and basic
1489.36,5.199,understanding of for you to get started
1491.52,4.96,with sql queries on sql server
1494.559,3.841,i hope you all had a great learning
1496.48,5.36,session and i hope to meet you in my
1498.4,3.44,next session thank you
