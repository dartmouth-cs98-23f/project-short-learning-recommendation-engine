6.399,3.521,hello everyone
7.359,3.36,and welcome to the course of database
9.92,4.56,management
10.719,5.841,systems or in short we call it as dbms
14.48,4.799,in this video we will be seeing the
16.56,5.04,basic introduction to dbms
19.279,3.601,before dbms we were using the file
21.6,3.519,system approach
22.88,3.6,in the later videos we will see more
25.119,4.08,about file systems
26.48,5.44,and why we prefer dbms approach over the
29.199,4.801,file system approach
31.92,4.159,before we get into the topic let us see
34.0,3.84,the outlines or the topics that we are
36.079,3.921,going to cover in this video
37.84,3.6,the first one we are going to see is the
40.0,3.76,basic definitions
41.44,3.04,or the basic terminologies that we need
43.76,2.639,to know
44.48,3.2,next we'll be looking into the
46.399,3.84,definition and
47.68,3.12,functionalities of database management
50.239,2.401,system
50.8,3.68,and then we'll be discussing about the
52.64,3.919,properties of database
54.48,3.28,next we'll be briefly looking into an
56.559,4.241,illustration of a
57.76,5.52,simplified database system environment
60.8,4.24,and then finally to understand database
63.28,3.839,and its functionalities better
65.04,4.24,we'll be looking into an example of
67.119,4.241,university database
69.28,4.24,so as we discussed first we'll be
71.36,4.0,looking into the basic definitions in
73.52,5.12,relation to dbms
75.36,6.32,the first one is data data
78.64,5.519,is any raw facts or unprocessed
81.68,3.68,facts that you can record like for
84.159,4.32,example
85.36,3.84,any numbers name of a person name of a
88.479,4.401,place
89.2,7.2,any kind of text images audio video
92.88,6.559,etc all these are called as data
96.4,5.92,next what is information
99.439,3.601,these unprocessed facts or otherwise
102.32,3.52,called as
103.04,4.48,data when they are processed to make a
105.84,4.639,meaningful context
107.52,4.48,then that is called as information or in
110.479,4.481,other words i can say
112.0,4.24,it is the processed data like for
114.96,4.64,example
116.24,6.08,the age of suresh is 25. so here i take
119.6,6.159,the raw facts or the unprocessed facts
122.32,6.559,process it to make a meaningful context
125.759,3.92,and that is called as information next
128.879,3.761,let us see
129.679,3.841,what is a database database is a
132.64,4.4,collection of
133.52,4.32,related data now a random collection of
137.04,3.52,data
137.84,5.119,or data that is not related cannot be
140.56,5.28,referred to as a database
142.959,3.761,it has to be a collection of related
145.84,4.08,data
146.72,6.48,like for example the data in an
149.92,5.599,online banking system database has to be
153.2,5.44,related to that particular bank
155.519,4.561,similarly the data in library management
158.64,3.44,system database
160.08,5.04,has to be related to that particular
162.08,7.12,library so this is what we call as a
165.12,6.96,database the next one is metadata
169.2,4.0,metadata is nothing but the database
172.08,3.439,definition
173.2,3.119,or in other words i can say it is the
175.519,3.841,complete
176.319,4.401,description of a database or it defines
179.36,4.0,the database
180.72,3.28,information like the storage format or
183.36,2.799,the data
184.0,3.599,type of the data that we are going to
186.159,4.561,store in the database
187.599,6.321,or the constraints on the data all these
190.72,5.519,information is called as metadata
193.92,4.48,so these are the basic definitions we
196.239,5.601,have seen in the further videos we will
198.4,6.16,see more definitions in relation to dbms
201.84,4.16,next let us see the definition of
204.56,4.48,database management
206.0,6.56,system database management system
209.04,5.6,is a system to manage the database
212.56,3.36,and here managing could be either
214.64,4.239,storing of data
215.92,4.48,or retrieval of data from the database
218.879,4.64,now let's look into the proper
220.4,6.16,definition of database management system
223.519,6.321,database management system is a system
226.56,4.0,or it is a software or i can say it is a
229.84,3.84,collection
230.56,6.319,of programs that enables users
233.68,6.559,or that allows the users to create
236.879,5.041,and maintain the database so this is a
240.239,4.481,very simple definition
241.92,5.44,now let's move on to the functionalities
244.72,6.079,of database management system
247.36,6.64,database management system allows users
250.799,6.241,to define the database to construct
254.0,5.68,the database manipulate and
257.04,3.439,share the database now defining the
259.68,4.16,database
260.479,5.44,involves specifying the data type
263.84,3.28,for the data that we are going to store
265.919,3.521,in the database
267.12,4.24,also specifying the structures and
269.44,3.759,constraints for the data
271.36,3.44,now constraints is nothing but the
273.199,4.641,limits on the data
274.8,5.2,like for example if i have age as the
277.84,3.12,data to be stored then i can have a
280.0,4.4,constraint
280.96,4.64,say age greater than 18 so only if age
284.4,3.44,is greater than 18
285.6,3.36,then only that data can be stored in the
287.84,3.52,database
288.96,3.84,so that is what we call as a constraint
291.36,3.76,the next functionality
292.8,3.36,constructing the database is nothing but
295.12,4.4,the process of
296.16,5.12,storing data on some storage medium
299.52,3.28,or in other words i can say it is a
301.28,4.32,storage of data
302.8,4.399,so when data is stored a database is
305.6,4.08,being constructed
307.199,3.361,the next functionality manipulation of a
309.68,2.72,database
310.56,3.6,includes functions like querying the
312.4,4.72,database to retrieve
314.16,3.28,or to get any data that the user needs
317.12,3.359,it
317.44,5.92,also allows users to update the database
320.479,3.761,and for generating reports the next
323.36,3.76,functionality
324.24,4.72,sharing the database allows multiple
327.12,5.12,users and programs
328.96,5.92,to access the database concurrently
332.24,3.44,or simultaneously or in other words i
334.88,4.4,can say
335.68,4.48,many users can access or share the same
339.28,3.919,database
340.16,4.879,at the same time in an efficient manner
343.199,3.201,so these are the main functionalities
345.039,4.88,that dbms provides
346.4,6.0,the other functions provided by dbms are
349.919,4.081,protection of the database from
352.4,4.4,unauthorized access
354.0,3.6,or from hardware or software failures
356.8,3.2,and also
357.6,3.52,maintenance of the database for a long
360.0,3.199,period of time
361.12,3.72,so that is with the functionalities of
363.199,4.321,database management
364.84,3.56,system next we will be discussing the
367.52,3.76,properties
368.4,4.16,of database there are three properties
371.28,5.039,of database
372.56,6.32,the first one is a database represents
376.319,4.961,some aspects of the real world or
378.88,4.8,otherwise called as the mini world
381.28,3.359,so anything in this mini world the
383.68,3.04,objects
384.639,3.12,their properties the relationships
386.72,4.4,between them
387.759,5.681,all that is represented by a database
391.12,4.96,and if there is any change in the real
393.44,3.12,world that change will also be reflected
396.08,3.76,in the
396.56,5.919,database the second property is
399.84,3.359,a database is a logically coherent
402.479,4.401,collection
403.199,6.321,of data with some inherent meaning
406.88,3.52,so as i said earlier a random collection
409.52,4.079,of data
410.4,4.56,or unrelated data cannot be referred to
413.599,3.521,as a database
414.96,3.04,the data in the database has to be
417.12,4.0,related
418.0,3.68,or logically coherent the next property
421.12,3.519,is
421.68,5.2,a database is designed and then built
424.639,5.12,and populated with data
426.88,5.12,for a specific purpose so these are the
429.759,4.481,three main properties of database
432.0,3.199,the first one is a database represents
434.24,2.959,the real world
435.199,3.44,secondly it is a logically coherent
437.199,4.56,collection of data
438.639,5.12,and thirdly a database is designed built
441.759,3.28,and then filled with data for some
443.759,3.761,purpose
445.039,3.801,next let us look into an illustration of
447.52,4.32,database system
448.84,4.12,environment so here we have the users or
451.84,4.56,the programmer
452.96,6.0,who writes queries or programs and these
456.4,4.0,queries or programs are processed by the
458.96,4.16,dbms software
460.4,4.16,and then based on the processed queries
463.12,4.639,dbms software
464.56,6.16,accesses the stored data in the database
467.759,5.44,that is it accesses the stored database
470.72,4.56,as well as it accesses the metadata
473.199,4.081,as we have already seen metadata is the
475.28,4.319,database definition
477.28,3.44,so this is a simple illustration of a
479.599,3.681,database system
480.72,3.28,environment where users write their
483.28,3.28,queries
484.0,4.56,and it is processed by the dbms software
486.56,4.319,and based on the processed queries
488.56,5.28,dbms software accesses the store
490.879,5.121,database as well as the metadata
493.84,3.199,as we discussed in the outlines finally
496.0,3.28,to understand
497.039,4.481,a database and its functionality is
499.28,3.84,better we'll be taking an example of a
501.52,3.92,university database
503.12,3.359,that stores student and course
505.44,3.28,information
506.479,4.4,so here i have taken three tables the
508.72,4.16,first one is the student table
510.879,4.08,which holds information about the
512.88,4.079,students in that university
514.959,3.52,the second table is the course table
516.959,3.121,which holds information about the
518.479,4.24,courses available
520.08,3.6,and third table is a grade report table
522.719,3.361,which contains
523.68,3.279,information about the grades received by
526.08,3.36,each student
526.959,4.32,in a particular course as we have seen
529.44,3.6,earlier the four functionalities
531.279,3.361,provided by dbms
533.04,4.16,let us try to understand those
534.64,4.48,functionalities better with this example
537.2,4.16,as we learn defining the database
539.12,4.56,involves specifying the data type
541.36,3.76,structures and constraints for the data
543.68,2.48,that we are going to store in the
545.12,3.44,database
546.16,3.119,so here specifying the structure of each
548.56,2.88,record
549.279,4.24,means specifying the different types of
551.44,2.72,data elements present in that particular
553.519,2.161,record
554.16,3.6,so here we have three records the
555.68,4.64,student record the course record
557.76,5.12,and the grade report record and these
560.32,3.6,columns are called as data elements in
562.88,3.84,each record
563.92,3.84,now specifying a data type would be now
566.72,3.6,for example
567.76,4.72,for student name i can say the data type
570.32,4.88,should be a string of characters
572.48,3.52,or for data element role number i can
575.2,3.84,say the data
576.0,4.399,type should be an integer and so on and
579.04,2.4,we've already discussed what a
580.399,3.201,constraint is
581.44,4.72,i can give a constraint on the student
583.6,5.239,name saying that student name cannot be
586.16,3.84,null so this is all about defining the
588.839,3.241,database
590.0,3.6,the next functionality constructing the
592.08,4.24,database is nothing but
593.6,5.359,storing data so once data is being
596.32,4.639,stored a database is being constructed
598.959,3.761,the next functionality is constructing
600.959,3.041,the database which is nothing but
602.72,3.84,storage of data
604.0,4.0,so when data is stored a database is
606.56,3.68,being constructed
608.0,3.44,then we saw database manipulation as the
610.24,3.599,next functionality
611.44,3.519,which involves querying and updating the
613.839,3.761,database
614.959,3.44,examples of queries would be listing all
617.6,3.6,the students
618.399,4.641,in the cs branch in that university or
621.2,4.0,listing the grades received by a
623.04,4.4,particular student in each course
625.2,4.48,and then we saw sharing the database
627.44,2.72,where this particular database can be
629.68,3.12,shared
630.16,3.919,by many users at the same time in an
632.8,3.52,efficient manner
634.079,3.681,so this is a very simple example of a
636.32,3.84,database that i've taken
637.76,4.319,to help you understand what a database
640.16,3.359,is and also to understand its
642.079,3.121,functionalities
643.519,3.76,with this we come to the end of this
645.2,2.639,video hope you all have understood the
647.279,14.56,basic
647.839,14.0,introduction to dbms thank you
662.0,2.079,you
