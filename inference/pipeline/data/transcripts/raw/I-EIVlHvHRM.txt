0.21,5.129,it's easy to get lost in Murphy Canada's
2.909,4.47,surreal installations but dig a little
5.339,4.441,deeper and you realize his work is made
7.379,4.321,up of millions of tiny pieces and that
9.78,3.81,every single little point represents a
11.7,4.17,piece of data that he's fed through a
13.59,4.83,neural network to show us his vision of
15.87,5.55,our future I was always like trying to
18.42,5.189,like speculate this idea of can data
21.42,4.5,become a pigment at the end the data is
23.609,4.771,a truly numbers that has no kind of in a
25.92,4.59,skin or skeleton but what I'm frankly as
28.38,4.98,an artist is find an algorithm that can
30.51,4.59,narrate the moment of data kind of like
33.36,4.289,make that invisible moment visible
35.1,4.59,enormous datasets inspire most of a
37.649,4.021,Nadal's art and he uses machine
39.69,4.439,intelligence and algorithms to create
41.67,4.409,visualizations what he calls data
44.129,3.481,sculptures like this piece called
46.079,3.241,machine hallucinations
47.61,3.87,he started by finding a hundred and
49.32,4.11,thirteen million images of New York
51.48,4.68,online and let the Machine learn from
53.43,5.64,the entire corpus of data and then we
56.16,5.219,also find a way to erase the humans from
59.07,4.5,this data and only focus on the
61.379,4.53,building's nature and environments that
63.57,4.44,is a collective memory of New York once
65.909,3.691,all of the images of people were removed
68.01,3.719,Anna Dahl was left with ten million
69.6,3.72,pictures of New York he fed them through
71.729,3.96,a machine learning algorithm that
73.32,4.83,generates visual associations as it
75.689,4.351,learns for example when it sees multiple
78.15,3.6,photos of the Statue of Liberty taken
80.04,3.75,from slightly different angles the
81.75,4.14,algorithm interpolates information to
83.79,4.35,help it create a moving shifting image
85.89,4.86,that represents the entire lifecycle of
88.14,5.22,the structure mission looks at this
90.75,4.59,information like a human being but it's
93.36,3.689,kind of more like a collective memories
95.34,3.84,than a personal memories because a
97.049,4.171,building in New York can be explored by
99.18,4.11,thousands of perspectives from multiple
101.22,4.74,angles from a different time of the year
103.29,4.46,it's more like an honest memory for a
105.96,3.6,machine because it feels more
107.75,4.36,totalitarian and like it feels
109.56,4.83,everything and everyone than just one
112.11,4.14,person and it all covered the walls in
114.39,4.019,the floor of a boiler room in a building
116.25,4.92,in lower Manhattan with this machine
118.409,4.621,interpreted dynamic landscape if you ask
121.17,5.28,him he'll tell you that the machine is
123.03,6.209,dreaming when a machine learns from
126.45,5.31,outputs and memories like this it can
129.239,4.351,create an alternative reality it look at
131.76,2.28,the patterns of the trees the buildings
133.59,3.09,and
134.04,5.399,nature the people every single thing
136.68,5.46,hidden inside this image corpus seeing a
139.439,5.461,machine giving a context of data and
142.14,5.73,creating and hallucinating outputs or
144.9,4.74,something like really inspiring in it
147.87,4.41,all created this piece to celebrate the
149.64,4.799,centennial of the LA Philharmonic using
152.28,3.989,half a million images thousands of audio
154.439,4.201,recordings and hundreds of videos from
156.269,4.351,the orchestra's archives he fed all that
158.64,3.989,into a series of algorithms that turned
160.62,4.56,it into these extraordinary projected
162.629,4.621,images by using measuring algorithms the
165.18,4.919,entire archive of LA Philharmonic
167.25,5.069,becomes a shape of three-dimensional
170.099,3.631,outputs we were able to see all these
172.319,3.06,data points be coming together or
173.73,4.02,disappearing and making kind of a new
175.379,4.14,sculptures and the building itself Frank
177.75,4.95,Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall became
179.519,5.851,part of the sculpture too I was always
182.7,5.28,like looking for inspiring buildings and
185.37,5.069,Frank Gehry became my hero and I rent a
187.98,5.069,car went to downtown it was 2:00 a.m.
190.439,4.41,the buildings light was off like there
193.049,4.11,was nothing around him and that night I
194.849,4.11,was really struck by an idea like what
197.159,4.89,will happen if this building can
198.959,5.011,remember like in a dream so he projected
202.049,3.72,the machine interpreted archives onto a
203.97,4.259,smaller model of the Walt Disney Concert
205.769,4.171,Hall once he settled on something he
208.229,4.68,liked he projected it onto the bigger
209.94,5.159,real-life building what we are doing is
212.909,4.41,another typical painting and a typical
215.099,4.29,sculpture but more like an experience
217.319,4.26,from a near future and when they come
219.389,4.141,together with sound data machine
221.579,3.87,intelligence and light and architecture
223.53,4.859,they have a new meaning and in kind of
225.449,5.4,symbiotic content connections I think I
228.389,5.07,was really hooked up by the idea of a
230.849,5.551,building can become an interface it can
233.459,5.31,be a boring advertising but it can be a
236.4,4.739,beautiful interface the ideation of a
238.769,3.461,human instinct become a part of a
241.139,3.521,machine
242.23,5.25,is really striking me like emotionally
244.66,5.28,Anna dhaan his team used 42 large scale
247.48,4.92,projectors with an astonishing 50k video
249.94,4.83,resolution to create a dramatic display
252.4,8.309,in downtown LA every night for 10 days
254.77,7.05,and not one of his favorite movies I was
260.709,1.891,8 years old when I watched the movie
261.82,2.88,Blade Runner
262.6,4.5,I was extremely inspired by the movie in
264.7,4.95,downtown Los Angeles a building suddenly
267.1,4.71,becomes alive and it has this cognitive
269.65,4.71,capacity of remembering and it has a
271.81,4.29,capacity of dreaming so this was all
274.36,4.26,like very high level science fiction
276.1,4.76,narratives and the futuristic dystopian
278.62,4.47,films exploration of more complex themes
280.86,3.7,echo a Nadal's interest in the
283.09,6.299,relationship between humans and
284.56,6.329,technology Ron Deckard and Rachael like
289.389,3.691,contemplates each other and has a
290.889,4.681,dialogue where Deckard defines Rachael
293.08,4.62,as a replicant it was a very interesting
295.57,5.909,moment or a human defines another
297.7,6.0,machine that is kind of this defining
301.479,5.491,what is real or what is not that that
303.7,5.279,kind of human consciousness and machine
306.97,5.37,consciousness were having its dialog
308.979,4.981,moment that was truly inspiring you
312.34,3.36,remember the spider that lived in a bush
313.96,3.66,outside your window the egg hatched
315.7,4.5,those aren't your memories there's
317.62,5.22,somebody else's I think in humanity we
320.2,5.19,have very certain findings that
322.84,4.62,transform who we are when we found the
325.39,4.589,fire we cook with it we create
327.46,5.31,communities with the same technology we
329.979,6.0,kill each other and destroy and clearly
332.77,5.58,AI is one of the discovery in humanity
335.979,3.75,that has a potential to make communities
338.35,3.689,or destroy each other
339.729,4.44,Anna defines data for his machine
342.039,4.141,intelligence collaborations everywhere
344.169,3.601,and when he learned that when data is
346.18,4.14,continuously being collected at the
347.77,4.95,Boston Airport he knew he'd found a gold
350.32,4.66,mine he turned it all into this project
352.72,4.54,called winds of Boston
354.98,3.9,I was always inspired by nature as an
357.26,3.9,inspiration from the like the wind
358.88,5.04,itself the water do the nature like a
361.16,4.86,core nature like aspect of motion theory
363.92,3.57,in life in general and I know this can
366.02,3.93,be an incredible opportunity like use
367.49,6.42,wind as it like a data and as a pigment
369.95,5.91,so we first located our data source from
373.91,3.81,the airport Logan Airport
375.86,4.53,the wind is extremely important for the
377.72,5.94,flight networks so we took a one-year
380.39,5.28,long wind data of Boston and this data
383.66,4.35,consists of the gust of speed and
385.67,4.59,direction and the temperature of the
388.01,5.01,weather and it all fed all this wind
390.26,5.64,data into a series of algorithms then he
393.02,4.74,built custom 13 foot tall LED screens to
395.9,3.33,display the visualized data and I
397.76,3.03,thought that algorithms can be an
399.23,3.84,incredible way of visualizing this
400.79,4.41,invisible pattern of wind and transform
403.07,3.84,them into a poetic like motion because
405.2,3.9,it's very inspiring that the machine can
406.91,4.44,find something interesting that I didn't
409.1,3.9,even think about it and and I found that
411.35,3.87,the true collaboration starts happen
413.0,4.08,there and sometimes machine gives
415.22,4.08,opportunities that I didn't think about
417.08,4.2,it and I do believe that is really
419.3,4.08,something that is inspiring for Humanity
421.28,4.5,that will most likely bring some new
423.38,6.03,kind of imagination methods that is not
425.78,5.76,discovered yet the inspiration for this
429.41,4.29,project called melting memories came
431.54,6.99,from a personal place I went to Istanbul
433.7,6.89,my hometown and my uncle just couldn't
438.53,4.62,remember where I am coming from and
440.59,6.01,apparently it was his first stage of
443.15,6.93,Alzheimer when this disease happens we
446.6,6.24,literally melt our memories our brain
450.08,4.14,tissue disappears but I also like was
452.84,3.93,very curious about scientifically
454.22,4.08,honestly what memory means like where
456.77,3.33,they come from what is the cognitive
458.3,4.26,like representation of a memory and the
460.1,4.23,images on these 20-foot tall LED screens
462.56,4.11,represent the real data behind that
464.33,5.82,process and these moments are really
466.67,5.13,trying to give a sense of a tangible
470.15,2.6,feeling of a memory I know that we are
471.8,3.35,not there
472.75,5.49,as technology that truly transcripts in
475.15,5.28,memory but it at least gives a glimpse
478.24,4.23,of an abstract language of a memory
480.43,4.65,that's one of those feelings that is
482.47,4.47,hidden in those algorithmic exploration
485.08,4.2,of data ended up partnered with
486.94,3.87,scientist at a neuroscience lab they
489.28,3.21,asked subjects to concentrate on
490.81,4.53,childhood memories and recorded all
492.49,4.92,their brain pulses using an EEG the data
495.34,4.02,itself is literally pulsing in a 4
497.41,4.26,milliseconds of a human brain activity
499.36,4.62,in the - location of brain from
501.67,5.04,hippocampus the frontal left lobe and
503.98,6.03,the algorithm symbolizes the moment of
506.71,5.85,remembering and it is how poetic moment
510.01,4.56,of this firing location into location of
512.56,4.26,the brain in a doll and his team created
514.57,3.839,custom software that transformed all of
516.82,3.48,that brain data into an artistic
518.409,3.961,interpretation of the neurons firing
520.3,4.92,another example of how we use this
522.37,4.71,technology to describe life I never
525.22,4.68,stopped thinking about data as a as a as
527.08,5.55,a mean of like material sometimes it can
529.9,5.12,be a wind data it can be a Wi-Fi
532.63,5.58,Bluetooth signal it can be a mission
535.02,5.92,intelligent decisions it can be a CPU
538.21,5.28,data GPU data it's honestly anything
540.94,4.98,that machine needs to understand life
543.49,4.74,can become a material for this
545.92,4.53,imagination one problem we had to solve
548.23,4.65,today is a visual discontinuity problem
550.45,4.08,ennahdha has built a team with expertise
552.88,4.74,in different fields to help him fulfill
554.53,7.53,his vision AI experts computer scientist
557.62,5.85,architects and designers and they're
562.06,3.45,working out a new workflow for a
563.47,4.56,data-driven public art project set for
565.51,4.23,Portland for this one a Nadal's letting
568.03,3.57,hundreds of thousands of images of
569.74,3.51,Portland and form both the projections
571.6,4.41,and the structure they'll be projected
573.25,5.339,on the team is using a 3d printer to
576.01,4.92,build a structure one panel at a time it
578.589,4.411,will ultimately be a 21 foot tall
580.93,4.02,sculpture I found that we were stuck in
583.0,4.47,this just virtual world I found that we
584.95,4.68,are in the screens to the flat world of
587.47,4.71,like imagination I was really looking
589.63,5.13,forward how we can take this mission
592.18,5.34,consciousness out of the screen and
594.76,5.12,bring it in 3d 3d world whatever is in
597.52,4.13,store for the future of an adult's work
599.88,4.83,machine learning will be the foundation
601.65,5.61,it's very clear that machines can really
604.71,5.64,capture our data machines can capture
607.26,6.12,our decisions our memories but it's not
610.35,6.45,clear what will happen to them and I
613.38,7.52,think also clearly the data we leave
616.8,6.84,behind is the memories of humanity my
620.9,4.3,obsession with this relationship is what
623.64,8.829,else we can do with that
625.2,7.269,[Music]
