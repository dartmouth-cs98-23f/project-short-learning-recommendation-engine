What's up guys I need three minutes on this one just because there's so much information
So time has gone
So human-computer interaction comes from a book in the 80s and it was about it was called the psychology of human-computer interaction
I'm gonna leave a link in the description and you probably come to this video because you may be thinking about studying
human-computer interaction or HCI and what effectively that is is it's the psychology of
Interaction between humans and computers. So I am a practicing UX designer and UX actually is
the wider spectrum human-computer action is a part of that and so is graphic design and then there's other things like
industrial design like the actual
Physical design of the device so UX is I guess it's all the jobs are called
It's it's just the practice in version of ACI. HCI is a form of M
I guess it's it's studyin and it specifically studying the interaction between humans and computers
So because computers have a dialogue with people and it's not like just a hammer that you use and you use it
However, it kind of feeds back. There's a lot of psychology that goes on so
The study of human-computer interaction is really understanding
the psychology of the person using the device and there's lots of different ways you can I
Guess you can affect the psychology of someone using and that might be okay
Just making things simple. So people like using the product but
in my opinion, there's parts of graphic design which come into HCI so that could be
Like the type of images they use that affects people's psychology
So when Obama was doing his campaign
they did lots of a B test about the type of images that he used on his website to get people to sign up and
They found that maybe color ones work better than black and white ones in this whole article about our link to in the description
So that's interesting to the whole psychology around there
then there is of a bit of a typography all these bits work into HCI and
So what I found there's a found a couple of great resources for you. I'm going to leave a link in the description
So I found the best
Colleges and universities in America that do HCI and you might want to check them out
I've also got a free course on my website a better self
so it takes about an hour you learn all the basics of UX design which HCI is a part of and
That's linked in the description as well and I'll leave a link to the original book from the 80s
So I think hates you guys moved on from the 80s its moved on to your ex design
because actually there's other things than just the
One-on-one interaction between the pet and advice these things like sound and there's I think
Aesthetics is really really important the way you know, Apple made the devices feel nice they made
kind of like luxury products
With the Braun reinvented the way products were designed and I'd say that's actually part of the human-computer interaction. Not just the actual interface
Design, a lot of people ask what's best to study is it I studied graphic design is a graphic designer human-computer interaction
I think graphic design is great because you can
Write x Don so graphic design is great because you can apply all of those all of those graphic design theories apply to computers
But human-computer interactions great
if you just want to focus on the side column or a cycle like psychological bits the research bets the
The juicy bits of understand and how people interactive computers
I hope that lesson made sense guys, if you think of it as a way, it's much alike and
Subscribe, I'm trying to grow this channel as fast as I can. Make sure you check out the resources. There's some great
Resources are in the description. Actually, there's a course. I'm linking from the University of San Diego
Which is free and it's like 11 months, so it's a great resource
If you want to do some free online training check out my course
there's loads of their
Students on there now and you might meet some friends and learn a few things along the way and until next time keep designing
