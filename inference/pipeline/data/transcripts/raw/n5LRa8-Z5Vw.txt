second,duration,transcript
0.08,3.92,welcome to
2.159,4.081,the webinar so
4.0,3.759,uh i'm antholon in charge of the human
6.24,3.279,computer attraction major at old
7.759,3.76,university i'm really happy to be here
9.519,3.921,it's the first webinar that i do in this
11.519,3.841,this role
13.44,4.08,and i've put together a presentation
15.36,4.16,that goes over
17.52,4.24,the contents and the
19.52,4.4,requirements and some opportunities that
21.76,5.2,we have and overall just gives a flavor
23.92,5.279,of of how we think and approach teaching
26.96,2.239,here
29.519,3.921,if you have questions i i guess we're
31.359,4.801,going to be taking them after the talk
33.44,4.24,so um please uh meanwhile of course you
36.16,4.96,can put them into chat we'll be
37.68,5.12,moderating a q a after that
41.12,3.279,um
42.8,4.0,couldn't make it today but he's my
44.399,4.881,deputy so he's associate professor of
46.8,4.32,game ai and game design at elder school
49.28,3.84,of uh sciences and now the school of
51.12,4.64,arts is jointly
53.12,4.16,appointed between these two schools
55.76,3.439,i'm at the school of electrical
57.28,4.4,engineering and as you see we're hosting
59.199,5.36,this program together uh with this uh
61.68,5.119,two schools ski and elec
64.559,4.081,and i'm in charge of the user interfaces
66.799,4.0,group uh if you're interested in what we
68.64,3.76,do you can you can look at our page i'll
70.799,3.521,just put the
72.4,3.6,link here but
74.32,5.76,from now on i'm going to be talking
76.0,6.32,about the program and the major so um
80.08,5.6,first of all i'll go through all the
82.32,4.96,universities just know who we are and uh
85.68,3.68,what's our
87.28,3.44,mode of operation and and what's our
89.36,2.96,mission and vision
90.72,3.52,and then i'm going to talk about the
92.32,4.08,major and how that's constructed and
94.24,3.519,what kind of courses you will be facing
96.4,3.2,if you come here and what kind of
97.759,3.36,opportunities you will be having
99.6,4.0,during the course season and of course
101.119,2.481,after that
104.24,4.64,um first of all a couple of words about
106.56,3.68,aldo so alde was formed roughly about 10
108.88,2.559,years ago
110.24,3.28,and
111.439,4.161,it had this mission of breaking
113.52,4.239,boundaries that you you would normally
115.6,4.32,have uh if you think about universities
117.759,4.561,and their departments and faculties and
119.92,4.239,and so on and try to have a
122.32,3.839,constellation and
124.159,4.72,that can address some some of these
126.159,4.961,societally important challenges like
128.879,4.08,sustainability and creativity in in
131.12,5.04,novel ways
132.959,5.121,and uh here's a timeline of
136.16,4.0,where the different universities come
138.08,4.64,from that came together to become old
140.16,4.88,university roughly roughly 10 years
142.72,3.92,10 years ago
145.04,2.88,and
146.64,4.08,one one of the things that we're really
147.92,4.959,proud of is our internationality so
150.72,4.32,maybe honey knows the statistics better
152.879,4.241,that we have a strong
155.04,3.76,contribution from
157.12,3.68,international students and research
158.8,3.76,faculty as well
160.8,4.64,i can't remember the exact proportions
162.56,5.039,but we're talking about 30 40 percent
165.44,4.32,across the board
167.599,3.121,that are the figures i cannot remember
169.76,3.759,then
170.72,5.599,exactly but yeah we are one of the most
173.519,4.0,uh international universities in europe
176.319,3.441,so
177.519,4.321,yeah that's really visible because we've
179.76,4.72,been also growing our attractiveness in
181.84,4.96,terms of students and the research
184.48,4.56,faculty intake so so you see that
186.8,3.92,whenever we open anything there we get
189.04,3.6,you know lots of different uh lots of
190.72,4.159,applications around the world
192.64,3.679,and that has helped us sort of ramp up
194.879,2.72,the quality of everything that we do
196.319,3.601,here
197.599,4.64,and um you know partial partially that's
199.92,4.959,because um of the mission that we have
202.239,4.64,that people find very very um
204.879,4.481,inspiring the other thing that i want to
206.879,3.361,raise up is our startup scene which is
209.36,2.32,also really strong
210.24,3.12,[Music]
211.68,4.24,you know around the compost that we have
213.36,4.48,in um in espo
215.92,3.76,if you if you look at two two kilometer
217.84,4.56,diameter somebody said that we have
219.68,5.6,roughly 100 companies there
222.4,5.839,in addition we have uh events like slash
225.28,5.12,and lots of uh business
228.239,4.241,incubators and so on and students have
230.4,5.68,lots of opportunities to join these
232.48,3.6,startups if they're interested in those
236.159,4.961,um so it's more more than just a degree
239.04,4.0,it's it's a it's a it's an experience
241.12,4.8,and also there's very lively communities
243.04,5.68,that are formed around uh students and
245.92,3.679,and uh international visitors and and so
248.72,2.719,on
249.599,5.041,and of course that has been a bit of a
251.439,6.32,hiatus because of the covet but nowhere
254.64,5.439,i think we're approaching status quo
257.759,2.32,soon
260.72,3.68,there are many rankings and all
262.16,3.68,universities will show you similar
264.4,3.6,rankings that they're really excellent
265.84,4.24,but something that i really want to
268.0,3.919,emphasize here that i'm very proud of is
270.08,3.679,that we're
271.919,3.28,you know one of the best young
273.759,2.88,universities i remember that we were
275.199,3.361,just established
276.639,4.321,around 11 years ago
278.56,3.359,and uh you know we're ranked as number
280.96,3.2,nine
281.919,4.641,among young universities globally we're
284.16,4.56,also very good in multi-disciplinary and
286.56,3.919,collaborative research which is you know
288.72,4.4,part of the student experience as well
290.479,4.241,as i'm going to show
293.12,3.28,the particular subject which is human
294.72,3.84,computer action is also highly ranked
296.4,3.84,i'll show you some some data on that
298.56,3.76,later
300.24,3.679,so you can you can be sure when you join
302.32,4.4,aldo you will be uh
303.919,5.12,resting on on state-of-the-art research
306.72,4.479,and activities
309.039,4.561,something that's also really nice uh is
311.199,4.72,that we have a really beautiful campus
313.6,5.12,it's it's in a bay uh there's a bird
315.919,5.601,reserved area and also forests it's
318.72,5.52,really walkable there's still a lively
321.52,5.6,uh center part which is just built
324.24,5.6,around a metro station and a mall
327.12,5.28,which is also quite new development so
329.84,4.4,it is easily reached and it's also
332.4,4.079,having all of the services and lots of
334.24,4.64,restaurants and stuff like that
336.479,3.841,and we've been building that uh compost
338.88,4.319,with the idea of increasing
340.32,2.879,sustainability
343.52,4.8,good um i don't know if you know much
346.08,4.399,about finland but finland has been
348.32,4.08,systematically ranked as one of the top
350.479,6.0,countries when it comes to
352.4,5.44,happiness and safety and so social uh
356.479,3.84,welfare
357.84,4.16,and uh you know it is a really safe
360.319,4.16,place to live and
362.0,5.6,there's a lot of nature and
364.479,5.44,you know most finns speak uh english
367.6,4.319,fluently so you'll find it easily easy
369.919,4.161,to to get around here especially in
371.919,4.241,helsinki metropolitan area right there
374.08,4.48,even the the mayor was suggesting that
376.16,4.319,we should we should add english as an
378.56,3.04,official language and he wasn't joking
380.479,4.321,so
381.6,3.2,maybe one day we'll have that
385.919,4.4,let's then talk about the program so
388.16,4.24,there's a bigger program called computer
390.319,3.44,communication and information sciences
392.4,2.639,so that's
393.759,3.121,for short
395.039,3.6,and underneath that umbrella there are
396.88,3.759,many majors and human computer
398.639,4.241,interaction is one of them
400.639,4.961,and human computer action is
402.88,4.319,a multi-disciplinary field that is that
405.6,4.64,is taking contributions from computer
407.199,5.28,science electrical engineering
410.24,3.28,also psychology and social sciences and
412.479,2.481,design
413.52,3.119,and we try to bring all of those
414.96,4.079,elements into our education but
416.639,3.84,nonetheless we have chosen a technical
419.039,3.361,focus and i'm going to talk about that
420.479,3.681,later so we want to ensure that our
422.4,3.28,students are not
424.16,3.52,you know just getting a generalist
425.68,4.959,education in hci but they have sort of a
427.68,4.56,sharp edge in their teaching that allows
430.639,4.161,them to to land
432.24,4.64,you know very good jobs
434.8,5.44,so i'll talk about that um
436.88,6.0,in a minute so why hci if you think
440.24,4.959,about ict as a whole i mean it's the
442.88,3.2,driving force in many many ways at the
445.199,3.601,moment
446.08,4.72,and uh nowadays if you think about
448.8,4.56,you know networking and computing
450.8,4.48,resources and all those magnesium
453.36,3.76,magnificent technical capabilities you
455.28,3.359,know they have made almost anything
457.12,3.12,possible and the question is what should
458.639,4.161,we do with this technology and that's
460.24,5.84,where human-centeredness becomes into
462.8,6.399,the picture and and human attraction is
466.08,5.839,uh is a big field within uh computer
469.199,4.081,science and information technology
471.919,3.361,and uh
473.28,5.4,this is a program to to be introduced
475.28,4.72,introduced to that field
478.68,2.12,[Music]
480.0,2.639,i
480.8,5.519,we've been building this program or this
482.639,5.84,major over a few years now and um
486.319,4.88,one design principle has been that we
488.479,4.801,would like to offer a very close contact
491.199,3.521,with research and that basically means
493.28,3.68,that we have
494.72,4.159,you know smaller studio-like
496.96,3.679,courses and also research project
498.879,3.921,courses and we offer a lot of
500.639,4.201,possibilities in terms of doing theses
502.8,5.04,work with the
504.84,5.32,groups and we're i'm going to show a
507.84,4.559,picture gallery all of us there
510.16,5.119,all the professors and um but you see
512.399,4.64,that we're quite big uh as when it comes
515.279,3.56,to human conflict interaction and we're
517.039,4.081,also very successful when it comes to
518.839,5.161,research and this is starting to be
521.12,4.399,recognized also internationally
524.0,3.68,we have
525.519,4.561,been ranked as number two in europe and
527.68,4.159,number 15 in the world and we're the
530.08,4.319,best in in nordic countries if you want
531.839,4.241,to come here and study hci then i think
534.399,2.801,we're we have a pretty good offer in
536.08,2.8,terms of
537.2,4.079,uh you know world-class
538.88,4.959,research
541.279,4.56,um and that's also shown in the
543.839,4.641,facilities and laboratories that we we
545.839,4.321,have here in our disposal
548.48,4.16,for example just in the previous period
550.16,3.76,we were teaching a user research and as
552.64,3.68,part of that then the students were
553.92,4.32,taken to our lab to to look at them and
556.32,4.48,work with the eye tracking technology in
558.24,4.56,those labs we have a multitude of other
560.8,5.039,technologies as well you know we have a
562.8,5.039,dedicated labs for vr and ar technology
565.839,4.321,uh then we have you know in our lab we
567.839,4.481,have uh methods and techniques for
570.16,4.64,empirical studies including eye trackers
572.32,3.92,and motion trackers and and whatnot and
574.8,2.8,then there are some other people who do
576.24,4.56,like um
577.6,4.96,fabrication like with 3d printing and
580.8,3.52,so you will find all of those elements
582.56,2.64,here
584.32,4.079,um
585.2,5.04,then i want to talk more about our uh
588.399,3.44,specialization here which is which is
590.24,3.599,you know technical human complete
591.839,4.881,interaction especially applying
593.839,5.841,computational and engineering principles
596.72,4.4,into the design and engineering of
599.68,3.36,interfaces and
601.12,4.64,interactive ai
603.04,4.72,and there's one particular
605.76,4.24,area called creative technologies that
607.76,3.84,that's uh becoming more and more central
610.0,5.92,in everything that we do and i want to
611.6,4.32,show you a small video reel
616.079,2.721,capturing many of these ideas it's quite
617.92,2.88,short
618.8,3.76,um but it gives a very nice overview of
620.8,4.159,the kind of work that we do this is
622.56,4.24,called an augmented climbing wall that
624.959,3.841,timeline is these are these are aei
626.8,4.0,generated phases
628.8,4.0,and here you see uh motion synthesis
630.8,4.719,that is based on ai that helps to design
632.8,5.12,better climbing walls
635.519,3.601,here's the animation
637.92,4.08,games
639.12,2.88,that use the body
643.04,5.12,eocdr technologies interaction
645.6,2.56,techniques
651.2,5.96,this is more more games that are
653.12,4.04,physically based or hexagames
660.72,5.2,and there's also uh we have a professor
663.279,4.641,who's working on interactive music
665.92,4.32,technology this is some stuff from our
667.92,6.08,lab we do models of human behavior and
670.24,6.8,use them in computational design
674.0,4.8,also we helped the french
677.04,5.039,nation to adopt a new standard for the
678.8,3.279,keyboards that was designed
683.04,4.479,so this is an this is a real of some of
685.279,4.401,the stuff that that we're doing here at
687.519,3.841,old university and we
689.68,3.2,we want to offer our students the
691.36,3.12,possibility of learning those those
692.88,3.28,technologies and just actually to be
694.48,3.52,very concrete tomorrow i'm going to be
696.16,3.52,teaching about one of those things that
698.0,4.399,that was visible in the videos there was
699.68,4.88,this by this typing video and i'm going
702.399,6.241,to talk about quality modeling uh in the
704.56,4.08,context of our computational api class
708.8,3.12,um
709.76,4.24,okay a couple of more examples just to
711.92,3.919,give you you know a concrete idea what
714.0,4.32,kind of things you will master after
715.839,5.44,taking this program
718.32,4.959,we use ai methods like deep learning
721.279,3.841,reinforcement and
723.279,4.481,computational simulation
725.12,4.88,to generate a human-like behavior so
727.76,5.28,then they use that as a model to
730.0,5.2,understand and improve tasks and and
733.04,5.039,designs for example now how would you
735.2,4.24,improve uh a techcentric method or
738.079,2.88,intelligent excellent system they need
739.44,3.6,to understand some something about how
740.959,5.44,people move their eyes and make
743.04,5.599,strategic decisions on how to find it
746.399,3.921,we have you you will also learn about
748.639,2.801,computational design which is something
750.32,2.72,that helps
751.44,2.72,designers
753.04,3.039,produce
754.16,3.919,better designs improve the productivity
756.079,3.361,improve their creativity
758.079,2.961,these are actual
759.44,3.44,uh examples of
761.04,3.599,this is an actual example where our
762.88,2.88,student has been involved
764.639,2.88,doing a
765.76,4.72,plug-in for designers that helps
767.519,5.201,designers fix issues with
770.48,3.68,guideline violations in the capital
772.72,3.28,interface designs
774.16,3.52,another student project is here on the
776.0,4.959,right uh we've been working with a
777.68,4.159,smartwatch um producer or manufacturer
780.959,2.88,that
781.839,4.321,was interested in adding a jester
783.839,4.56,recognizer that's actually good for real
786.16,4.08,use or robust enough and then we worked
788.399,3.44,on deep learning-based gesture
790.24,3.599,recognizers and collecting really
791.839,6.281,impressive data set to drain that and
793.839,4.281,help them improve their robustness
800.24,3.599,another
801.2,4.56,slide of examples uh here's the work by
803.839,4.56,berto hama where they they work with
805.76,4.319,rodio to do automated game level testing
808.399,4.081,so in the future
810.079,4.401,uh you you're not necessarily running an
812.48,4.24,expensive and vertical studies but using
814.48,4.56,these ai models of people
816.72,3.44,maybe they are models of gamers in this
819.04,4.0,case
820.16,4.32,to evaluate and design for example game
823.04,3.76,levels
824.48,4.08,so what what happens here is that then
826.8,2.8,you know they gave a game game level to
828.56,4.24,an ai
829.6,5.039,robot or bot but that is then trained to
832.8,4.159,dissolve the game levels and then they
834.639,4.481,get indices of things like well how
836.959,3.841,difficult these levels are or how
839.12,3.76,quickly they would jump out of the game
840.8,3.44,or and do something else
842.88,3.759,and so on
844.24,4.399,what we also do is we work with ai to
846.639,4.801,improve experimentation with human
848.639,5.121,subjects um just actually next week uh
851.44,4.24,you know my pc student is going to teach
853.76,4.079,our students how to do bayesian
855.68,4.8,optimization based experimentation that
857.839,4.24,makes experimentation way more efficient
860.48,3.52,than it ever used to be
862.079,4.641,i already showed that this example in
864.0,5.6,the video review about the keyboards
866.72,5.04,we teach methods that help or can can
869.6,4.32,solve some really hard design problems
871.76,3.199,for example how to uh
873.92,3.2,assign
874.959,5.761,characters or letters onto a keyboard or
877.12,5.519,how to how to do a menu or a web page or
880.72,4.64,or an interaction technique that is
882.639,5.601,optimal for for for your users
885.36,5.12,so we're learning also those methods
888.24,4.56,so this is giving a an overview of
890.48,4.32,something you know sharp end of you know
892.8,4.399,what you're going to learn here
894.8,3.76,but it's you know by no means limited to
897.199,2.801,what you just saw
898.56,3.44,and let me actually talk about the
900.0,4.48,broader offering that we have
902.0,4.399,um so i'm i'm here the professor of
904.48,4.24,interfaces and then we have
906.399,4.88,um a large number of other people who
908.72,5.6,are involved in our our teaching
911.279,4.721,elisa necklace is a professor who came
914.32,3.44,from switzerland and she has a
916.0,4.72,background in psychology and she's
917.76,5.28,interested in studying motivation and
920.72,4.559,experience so basically what keeps a
923.04,4.479,gamer motivated and
925.279,3.281,sustain gaming perks that's one of the
927.519,2.32,questions
928.56,2.959,i already showed some of the work that
929.839,3.44,bert has been doing
931.519,4.401,then we have a new professor who joined
933.279,4.48,from rutgers university in the us i am
935.92,3.919,the lindquist he studies the question
937.759,3.2,that how to make systems that are both
939.839,2.0,usable
940.959,3.12,and
941.839,4.0,secure and that's an interesting area of
944.079,3.76,usable security that is a very timely
945.839,4.24,topic right now
947.839,3.761,and then we also were joined by a new
950.079,4.161,professor of practice
951.6,4.479,anita sony who's looking at human
954.24,4.32,centered design and he's offering for
956.079,5.281,example a very timely course on
958.56,4.8,designing for crises so he was literally
961.36,3.44,looking at you know how can design
963.36,3.2,alleviate some of the issues that we
964.8,4.08,have with covid
966.56,4.639,and he's been holding this uh for two
968.88,4.24,times now the seminar
971.199,3.841,and we're also working with uh the alta
973.12,4.079,alta school of arts and there we have
975.04,4.799,our colleagues andres lucero
977.199,2.64,and uh
979.92,3.599,and we've been uh deepening our
981.839,3.601,collaboration with them so we try to
983.519,4.56,offer more possibilities for our
985.44,4.8,students to take their courses but also
988.079,4.0,um their students to take our courses so
990.24,2.88,that they they would mix and mingle a
992.079,3.521,little bit
993.12,4.719,concretely we're offering our students
995.6,5.2,the possibility of taking a course on
997.839,4.721,collaborative design which is one of the
1000.8,2.719,highlights of our although school of
1002.56,2.8,arts
1003.519,3.601,research
1005.36,4.8,we're also organizing a computational
1007.12,4.959,design seminar with all the arts in the
1010.16,3.359,in the fall
1012.079,4.481,and we also have
1013.519,5.521,contributions from the ai folks here at
1016.56,4.399,helsinki which is a really strong
1019.04,4.96,program as well we have something like
1020.959,3.761,16 professors in ai and machine learning
1024.0,3.039,and
1024.72,4.239,we have to be taking some key courses
1027.039,4.16,from their offerings just and made them
1028.959,3.84,possible made them available for our
1031.199,4.401,students
1032.799,4.481,we have professor practice johanna kaipi
1035.6,3.76,i think she's known johanna
1037.28,3.6,and her topic is healthcare assistance
1039.36,3.679,usability
1040.88,3.919,and then marconi eminem who's uh in
1043.039,5.52,charge of the strategic usability so
1044.799,5.041,basically how to um strategically
1048.559,2.881,organize
1049.84,3.36,and manage
1051.44,3.599,activities in companies
1053.2,3.76,targeting usability and use experience
1055.039,2.801,so that you're going to get a higher
1056.96,2.0,level
1057.84,3.12,uh
1058.96,4.32,perspective to hci from
1060.96,5.52,from his courses
1063.28,5.6,so this is a gallery of us and of course
1066.48,6.319,we also have elixirs here
1068.88,5.84,um uh on salovara and nikon and many
1072.799,4.641,other ones
1074.72,3.839,and and one of the design principles of
1077.44,2.72,the whole
1078.559,3.601,major has been that we would like to
1080.16,3.759,offer a lot of possibilities for you to
1082.16,3.6,choose courses this is quite unique i
1083.919,3.601,mean many other programs are less that
1085.76,3.44,they move like a train and you have no
1087.52,3.68,no degree of freedom
1089.2,4.24,and uh what we would like to do is that
1091.2,4.96,okay well you can propose your own
1093.44,5.04,specialization right we make certain
1096.16,3.84,courses available and sort of recommend
1098.48,2.88,it but you can go wrong that if you
1100.0,3.039,wanna let's say that you you're
1101.36,4.0,interested in brain computer interfaces
1103.039,4.0,okay well let's talk how you can how you
1105.36,3.439,can specialize in that one you know
1107.039,3.841,maybe you would go to take some of the
1108.799,3.681,courses that we have in neurosciences
1110.88,4.56,and brain imaging and maybe some of the
1112.48,4.319,courses that we have in uh like sensors
1115.44,2.96,and measurement in the electrical
1116.799,2.711,engineering school and maybe some
1118.4,2.32,machine learning
1119.51,3.289,[Music]
1120.72,3.92,contributions as well and you know by
1122.799,3.921,this kind of work then then we'd like to
1124.64,3.919,help you to to specialize in a way that
1126.72,4.16,you you find interesting
1128.559,4.801,and you see here a big portfolio of some
1130.88,4.48,of the ac aci related topics that we
1133.36,3.76,have at alto that uh you know
1135.36,4.24,surprisingly can have
1137.12,4.24,uh you know even the school of chemical
1139.6,2.8,engineering uh they they have for
1141.36,3.199,example
1142.4,3.92,computational design courses they on you
1144.559,4.24,know they don't really do design like we
1146.32,5.599,do but they focus for example the design
1148.799,4.721,the design of um of materials and uh but
1151.919,3.281,nonetheless you know it would teach you
1153.52,3.68,some some basics of
1155.2,3.599,of computational design in in a
1157.2,4.32,methodological perspective that can be
1158.799,5.12,applied in many places then we have also
1161.52,4.399,a school of business and
1163.919,3.841,school of engineering that also have
1165.919,4.561,been offering related things like on
1167.76,5.2,product design and engineering design
1170.48,4.24,but much of the stuff focuses on school
1172.96,4.16,of electrical engineering and school of
1174.72,5.12,science and there we have
1177.12,4.4,three world leading spearhead areas so
1179.84,3.28,there's the computational design that i
1181.52,3.519,briefly showed
1183.12,3.04,interactive machine learnings how to how
1185.039,4.88,to learn
1186.16,5.92,human in the loop and make systems
1189.919,5.041,operate like that and then the other
1192.08,4.88,area is is the game design and game
1194.96,4.88,that i showed that is represented by
1196.96,5.28,elyssa meckler and that's
1199.84,4.719,but as you see we also have people
1202.24,4.88,offering courses and doing research in
1204.559,4.081,the area vr and ar that are very
1207.12,4.799,important at the moment and we're also
1208.64,6.08,building a new uh world-class facility
1211.919,5.041,of 25 million euros called alta studios
1214.72,4.4,which will be a physical space with lots
1216.96,5.68,of different labs that are equipped with
1219.12,5.6,um with state-of-the-art uh equipment uh
1222.64,4.72,vr and ar
1224.72,4.079,so you know this is a portfolio of some
1227.36,3.679,of the stuff that we can offer to you
1228.799,5.281,when you when you get to the stage of
1231.039,4.321,uh picking uh the specializations of
1234.08,3.599,course you don't get to do that
1235.36,4.559,immediately the the point of the
1237.679,4.641,another design principle has been that
1239.919,4.0,uh you first learn certain core things
1242.32,3.12,so that you're then ready you know to
1243.919,4.161,specialize with when you're equipped
1245.44,4.96,with the necessary knowledge to do that
1248.08,3.839,and some of the the common courses
1250.4,3.04,you're going to see here
1251.919,4.721,and um
1253.44,5.2,as you see here uh there's an important
1256.64,4.08,sentence there at top so which is that
1258.64,4.08,you know you you can pick
1260.72,4.88,a selection of these courses let's say
1262.72,4.88,35 if you're doing the long major or 25
1265.6,4.079,if you're doing the shorter major
1267.6,5.12,and you pick among courses like well
1269.679,5.201,social media or human factors or user
1272.72,5.28,interface technologies or
1274.88,5.679,emerging technologies and and um
1278.0,4.799,and you know that's going to give you
1280.559,4.0,a bit of a control over the direction
1282.799,3.201,that you want to take but without
1284.559,2.48,compromising
1286.0,2.64,um
1287.039,4.561,that the core that you need to have in
1288.64,3.919,order to specialize later on
1291.6,3.04,um
1292.559,4.24,this is being updated for next year so
1294.64,4.08,we're going to have more
1296.799,4.081,some changes here for example in terms
1298.72,3.839,of security engineering and
1300.88,3.76,this co-design course that i mentioned
1302.559,4.401,from all the arts and some other changes
1304.64,2.32,as well
1308.159,3.121,okay and after that then then you're
1309.679,3.441,going to have to choose how to
1311.28,4.48,specialize and as i said there's this
1313.12,6.16,very large buffet of courses that you
1315.76,5.44,can take across alt university and
1319.28,4.16,you know i just listed some areas that
1321.2,4.8,are asia related that have been
1323.44,5.04,picked by our students over the years so
1326.0,4.72,just to give you some sampling uh we we
1328.48,4.16,have some offerings in web technology
1330.72,3.92,and if you want to focus on like
1332.64,4.24,interactive web then you would pick our
1334.64,4.0,courses on like interface construction
1336.88,2.48,and web technology
1338.64,3.519,and
1339.36,4.24,maybe user evaluation and user research
1342.159,3.841,and that you know that would form a nice
1343.6,4.64,package for you to then have a
1346.0,4.4,specialization in web technology
1348.24,4.0,similarly we have offerings
1350.4,3.92,in the school of electrical engineering
1352.24,4.24,on speech recognition technology and
1354.32,4.0,natural language processing so pick
1356.48,4.8,something from there and combine that
1358.32,4.4,with our computational hci cores
1361.28,4.0,and you know that allow you then to
1362.72,4.88,build interactive systems that operate
1365.28,5.04,via speeds or always
1367.6,3.6,we have a robotics professor village at
1370.32,3.599,elect
1371.2,5.12,we have an ar and vr competencies at
1373.919,4.401,both ski and elec and related to
1376.32,4.08,professors and classes
1378.32,4.88,uh and so on and so forth right so you
1380.4,5.12,get the sense that um you know there's
1383.2,4.56,lots of possibilities to to pick and mix
1385.52,4.32,the way where you would like so that how
1387.76,3.84,this practically goes is that then at
1389.84,3.04,some point you're asked to do your own
1391.6,3.92,study plan
1392.88,5.36,and that study plan is then reviewed by
1395.52,3.76,me or whoever happens to be in charge of
1398.24,3.76,the program
1399.28,3.759,um and then you get feedback and ideas
1402.0,3.2,on how to
1403.039,3.601,how to pick the best courses so we want
1405.2,3.52,our students to have
1406.64,3.279,you know some challenging courses and
1408.72,2.959,and also
1409.919,4.161,you know thematical orientation that
1411.679,4.24,makes them uh recruitable so that they
1414.08,4.719,they can end it in the next stage after
1415.919,5.041,after getting the degree
1418.799,3.601,good um
1420.96,3.839,this is an overall structure of the
1422.4,4.56,study so there's going to be the common
1424.799,3.921,courses that i showed specialization
1426.96,4.4,that's part of the major and then
1428.72,4.8,there's possibility for elective studies
1431.36,4.16,uh you can pick also
1433.52,3.68,completely outside of the major itself
1435.52,4.0,maybe you do want to do something in
1437.2,5.28,like entrepreneurship or
1439.52,4.639,all the arts they have some excellent
1442.48,3.52,interaction design courses or i don't
1444.159,3.201,know graphic design courses and big big
1446.0,2.88,some of them
1447.36,3.439,and then of course we have master's
1448.88,4.88,thesis
1450.799,5.681,um which is a big part of
1453.76,3.76,of the the study so it's about half a
1456.48,3.12,year
1457.52,4.72,and i'll talk more about massage thesis
1459.6,3.84,in a minute
1462.24,3.52,um
1463.44,4.88,so after your your degree
1465.76,4.32,there are many opportunities in staying
1468.32,2.88,in finland and also during your studies
1470.08,2.88,to get
1471.2,3.28,contact points with the with the finnish
1472.96,3.199,ict industry
1474.48,4.079,we have really strong
1476.159,5.441,ict games and service industries right
1478.559,4.961,here in the capital region
1481.6,3.04,we and we work really closely with the
1483.52,4.639,industry
1484.64,5.84,so we have industry directly funding us
1488.159,4.241,and um you know it's just maybe a
1490.48,3.36,concrete example so so just just
1492.4,3.04,yesterday
1493.84,3.6,uh porsche
1495.44,3.92,the car manufacturer they contacted us
1497.44,3.119,and they want to collaborate with us on
1499.36,4.0,designing
1500.559,4.72,um you know some some new dashboards and
1503.36,3.919,you know maybe that then leads to a

1537.76,3.919,telecommunications industry that i
1539.52,4.08,particularly wanna wanna mention so in
1541.679,4.0,addition to the startup community we
1543.6,3.679,have ericsson and nokia
1545.679,5.841,and they're always looking for for
1547.279,4.241,talent also in human compass direction
1552.64,2.48,okay
1553.679,3.521,well if you're not interested in
1555.12,4.96,industry carrier but you rather want to
1557.2,4.959,do a research career uh which i you know
1560.08,4.88,strongly recommend considering
1562.159,5.281,uh we do have a new system called the
1564.96,3.28,doctoral track and hci major is part of
1567.44,3.599,that
1568.24,4.96,control track um it's not
1571.039,4.321,something that uh you you you must take
1573.2,3.92,in order to become a psc student
1575.36,3.6,um that is something that if you have
1577.12,4.48,already decided no you know then you can
1578.96,4.48,apply for this under there's a special
1581.6,5.36,system where you would be doing some
1583.44,5.76,research gigs as a resource assistant in
1586.96,4.24,in close collaboration with four uh
1589.2,2.959,different professors and teams during
1591.2,2.959,the track
1592.159,3.841,so right now there's one student in the
1594.159,5.281,track uh because we just started last
1596.0,6.4,year and she's doing the the last um i
1599.44,5.76,think she's doing the last um
1602.4,4.08,uh gig this this year
1605.2,4.64,actually next year and then she's
1606.48,6.72,starting the masses north species
1609.84,5.52,um you know we were proud that our uh
1613.2,4.16,nazi students are also recruited around
1615.36,3.919,the world to psd
1617.36,4.08,studies you know i i have a very
1619.279,4.681,positive experience of our students
1621.44,5.599,going to top places in the world uh
1623.96,4.599,ethiopia and epfl and university
1627.039,4.321,copenhagen
1628.559,5.12,they all have our students and we
1631.36,4.559,support strongly uh ambitious students
1633.679,4.161,who want to go and do their phd even if
1635.919,4.961,they don't necessarily do that do do
1637.84,4.319,those with us
1640.88,3.2,um
1642.159,2.961,maybe with that we could turn over to
1644.08,2.88,katya
1645.12,5.039,who was kind enough to
1646.96,5.839,give us our student point of view
1650.159,4.721,uh yeah hello everyone my name is katya
1652.799,4.561,and currently i'm doing my second year
1654.88,3.679,of studies in the program human computer
1657.36,2.24,interaction
1658.559,2.961,and
1659.6,4.64,to start with my journey without
1661.52,3.519,university began even before my studies
1664.24,2.48,i
1665.039,3.52,was
1666.72,4.8,i was a recent assistant for a summer
1668.559,5.761,internship in 2019 and
1671.52,4.48,to be honest it was a crucial period for
1674.32,3.12,my decision where i want to go to my
1676.0,4.24,bachelors
1677.44,4.88,so i applied for the master for the
1680.24,4.48,masters in alta and i was accepted and
1682.32,4.479,it was very happy moment for me
1684.72,4.319,and
1686.799,4.081,currently i'm finishing my studies to
1689.039,4.321,start writing master thesis in the
1690.88,5.039,second semester of this year
1693.36,5.84,and speaking about my experience i
1695.919,4.961,switched to beat my domain of interest
1699.2,4.56,for the bachelors i studied social
1700.88,4.799,sciences and social informatics but my
1703.76,3.36,master's program here is a little bit
1705.679,3.441,more technical
1707.12,3.679,uh i'm doing a lot of major in human
1709.12,4.48,computer interaction
1710.799,5.041,and also i do a minor in data analysis
1713.6,5.439,and data science
1715.84,4.88,and it really fascinates me how alton
1719.039,4.321,university provides you provides
1720.72,3.679,opportunities to try different things to
1723.36,3.84,learn more
1724.399,3.601,about the spheres that really interest
1727.2,3.76,you
1728.0,5.36,so currently during these two years i
1730.96,5.28,tried working with some
1733.36,4.319,with some industry cases for example as
1736.24,3.679,auntie told about the course on
1737.679,4.081,collaborative evaluation there with a
1739.919,2.88,bunch of other students we tried to
1741.76,3.039,improve
1742.799,4.24,side website of the
1744.799,5.041,finnish health uh
1747.039,4.081,ministry with like regarding the covet
1749.84,3.6,stuff
1751.12,4.64,and it was a practical case that was
1753.44,4.64,really interesting to try but also there
1755.76,4.639,were a bunch of academic opportunities
1758.08,4.8,like i'm a research assistant in user
1760.399,4.0,interfaces lab and throughout the two
1762.88,3.36,years i tried
1764.399,4.201,different spheres and i worked with
1766.24,3.919,different people there and it is also
1768.6,4.679,[Music]
1770.159,4.64,really helpful to shape your mind and
1773.279,3.12,understand what really
1774.799,4.161,what is really interesting for you and
1776.399,5.361,what do you want to do after the studies
1778.96,5.839,but life in elton university is not only
1781.76,5.84,studies we do have a lot of activities
1784.799,5.6,for students there is a very strong
1787.6,3.92,culture of like student life here and
1790.399,3.601,for example
1791.52,4.24,myself i'm living on the campus like we
1794.0,3.679,have a lot of dormitories
1795.76,3.12,which are very close to all the study
1797.679,3.6,buildings
1798.88,4.88,and here we can like
1801.279,5.441,even like walk a walk around or also we
1803.76,5.36,do have a lot of different activities
1806.72,4.72,like dance clubs or
1809.12,4.559,like theater study
1811.44,5.359,student theater theater sports club and
1813.679,5.36,so on and so forth so it is always a
1816.799,4.401,bunch of opportunities to do something
1819.039,4.721,and now when they like go with situation
1821.2,4.479,is getting better there are a lot of
1823.76,3.919,more and more things you can do around
1825.679,4.961,the campus
1827.679,6.161,and uh speaking about life of life in
1830.64,6.0,finland it's really calm and very very
1833.84,4.64,safe for like from the student's
1836.64,3.039,perspective
1838.48,3.36,and
1839.679,5.841,i can really
1841.84,7.04,say that it is a great opportunity to
1845.52,5.039,to leave and to study like um
1848.88,3.84,so yeah
1850.559,4.961,from me it was the mostly positive
1852.72,4.48,experience and i'm really helpful i'm
1855.52,3.999,really happy with the decisions i made a
1857.2,5.28,couple years ago so that
1859.519,6.321,as i'm in the place i feel like i should
1862.48,3.36,be right now
1866.399,4.561,thanks katya and um
1869.76,2.799,can you say something about your
1870.96,5.12,master's thesis or did you already agree
1872.559,6.801,on the topic because that's super cool
1876.08,6.56,uh right now i don't have my exact topic
1879.36,4.96,yet because i started the position just
1882.64,4.639,a couple days ago
1884.32,5.839,uh but where was speaking about the
1887.279,6.561,design dot ai project which is suppose
1890.159,5.681,supposed to help designers in their work
1893.84,5.6,we're speaking about the plugin for such
1895.84,5.36,tools as figma or sketch where a lot of
1899.44,3.52,where a lot of
1901.2,3.92,technical details requires a lot of
1902.96,4.719,attention from the designer but with the
1905.12,5.36,help of the plug-in some features can be
1907.679,5.201,automized like layouts
1910.48,4.72,transformation or
1912.88,4.88,changing color palettes so
1915.2,4.479,the goal is actually make people's life
1917.76,3.759,easier and i appreciate this so much
1919.679,4.88,because it's just cool to see the
1921.519,5.28,results of your work and yeah
1924.559,4.561,this is really great
1926.799,4.321,thanks katya i i forgot to mention that
1929.12,4.24,i think most of our master's thesis
1931.12,5.039,positions are paid so whether you do
1933.36,4.96,that in industry or within our groups
1936.159,4.24,you get salary for that
1938.32,4.16,and normally what students do is that
1940.399,4.88,they take either ta so teaching
1942.48,4.72,assistant position that is also paid or
1945.279,3.921,which has a system position that is also
1947.2,3.92,paid and then they follow up with them
1949.2,4.0,with the masses this is at some point in
1951.12,3.36,a group so
1953.2,3.199,if you're looking for you know like
1954.48,4.88,sustaining you're living here you know
1956.399,5.12,that's nice uh side income for you as
1959.36,4.96,well
1961.519,4.241,okay um good uh maybe
1964.32,3.599,honey i don't know if you want to say
1965.76,3.519,something about student life which uh
1967.919,2.081,you know i don't have a lot of contact
1969.279,2.4,to
1970.0,3.76,but but there there's a very strong
1971.679,4.24,student union uh we have housing
1973.76,4.639,services and support
1975.919,4.801,we have a good healthcare system for
1978.399,4.241,students and and also
1980.72,4.0,i would say excellent facilities for
1982.64,3.68,sports because they're they're the old
1984.72,4.0,olympic facilities that have been
1986.32,4.239,developed from the 1954
1988.72,3.439,when the olympics were here
1990.559,4.0,in helsinki
1992.159,4.161,and you know so we have a big hall uh
1994.559,4.0,practically with lots of different
1996.32,3.599,facilities for students i don't know
1998.559,3.281,honey if you want to add something on
1999.919,4.48,this
2001.84,5.28,um i think that was quite good but just
2004.399,4.961,to remind everyone that we have housing
2007.12,4.24,around the campus as as katya already
2009.36,4.72,mentioned that she's living living
2011.36,6.4,actually there and then
2014.08,5.839,we have the sense of community the ayy
2017.76,5.759,is a big organization which gathers all
2019.919,4.88,the students at aldo so you always find
2023.519,2.0,help or
2024.799,2.561,uh
2025.519,4.64,friends to do something
2027.36,5.76,and we try to really take care of you
2030.159,5.841,also you know means of health care
2033.12,5.6,which is provided for the students so

2038.72,4.4,we will try to take care of all of our
2041.039,3.681,students
2043.12,3.919,and so now i just want to add that now
2044.72,5.119,that the cove pandemia is over we can
2047.039,5.761,also go back to the regular cycle of of
2049.839,4.881,celebrations which i i think is uh it is
2052.8,4.4,worth mentioning that uh we have the
2054.72,3.28,mayday celebration first of
2057.2,3.12,may
2058.0,4.48,which is a big student event basically
2060.32,3.759,so all the students are former students
2062.48,3.119,they put on the caps and they go and
2064.079,3.04,have fun
2065.599,3.441,so and then there will be lots of
2067.119,5.201,activities around at that time on the
2069.04,3.28,campus related to that
2073.119,4.401,okey-dokey um maybe honda do you want to
2075.359,3.601,say some words about admission i think
2077.52,2.639,it's really well explained on the page
2078.96,2.48,but if there's something special you
2080.159,2.881,want to mention yeah
2081.44,3.6,so
2083.04,4.559,actually the the this year's application
2085.04,4.319,series is coming really soon it starts

2095.28,4.799,is the masters application be released
2097.44,5.6,this year and we have masters
2100.079,4.641,application period always once a year
2103.04,2.559,at the end of the year
2104.72,3.44,um
2105.599,5.041,so there's the link
2108.16,4.24,you can see and please check carefully
2110.64,3.68,all the application instructions from
2112.4,3.84,there there's also information about
2114.32,3.2,scholarships and tuition fees that we
2116.24,4.0,offer
2117.52,4.72,and then all the general admission
2120.24,4.16,requirements please remember to check
2122.24,4.24,the all the universities general
2124.4,4.64,admission requirements and then what
2126.48,4.96,this human computer interaction program
2129.04,4.0,has itself
2131.44,4.32,so that is the
2133.04,4.96,info i recommend you to check
2135.76,5.92,really carefully when you are apply and
2138.0,3.68,we are waiting for your applications
2141.92,3.76,that's fun and i i think it makes sense
2143.76,3.76,to tell your story in the letter of
2145.68,4.32,motivation you know why do you want to
2147.52,4.0,study study hci and what
2150.0,3.04,drives you and
2151.52,3.68,what kind of things you you might build
2153.04,4.24,on from the previous education that you
2155.2,3.68,want to bring here i think katya is an
2157.28,2.799,excellent example of you know bringing
2158.88,2.88,something completely different like
2160.079,2.961,social sciences here
2161.76,3.599,and then doing something interesting
2163.04,2.319,with that
2165.68,4.64,okay um
2167.76,5.28,we are now ready to take your questions
2170.32,4.72,and uh maybe you have been keeping track
2173.04,4.48,of the questions and
2175.04,4.0,can you pick some questions
2177.52,3.44,okay i think the
2179.04,5.2,first one over here is that will a
2180.96,5.44,bachelor's degree in age uh hi
2184.24,4.48,how do you say the acronym human
2186.4,4.88,computer interaction how it will raise
2188.72,4.8,my chances to get accepted income in
2191.28,4.48,comparison to computer science degrees
2193.52,5.12,so which kind of background do you
2195.76,2.88,prefer anti
2198.839,4.52,um
2200.72,5.04,in comparison to to get accepted to to
2203.359,4.72,what will a bachelor's degree
2205.76,4.16,oh yeah you know hci is fine uh we would
2208.079,3.441,like to have people who have some
2209.92,3.439,computer science because much of our
2211.52,4.079,teaching focuses on
2213.359,5.041,on or uses computer science let's put it
2215.599,4.081,like that so if you have a course on uh
2218.4,3.52,minimum you should have something on
2219.68,5.52,programming ideally something on like
2221.92,4.159,algorithms and you know systems and so
2225.2,2.32,on
2226.079,3.76,um you know that's going to make your
2227.52,4.079,life easier
2229.839,4.961,that's not a hard requirement that that
2231.599,3.201,would be beneficial to have
2237.52,4.88,then there's a question
2240.079,3.801,i will not be able to start a master
2242.4,5.36,until november
2243.88,6.44,2022 and the master starts in september
2247.76,4.88,is this going to be a big problem if i
2250.32,4.96,start late
2252.64,4.64,um it will be a bit of a problem because
2255.28,4.079,many of the orientations and first
2257.28,4.319,things that they start in september and
2259.359,3.76,then we have the first period
2261.599,3.52,you know which is going to be quite
2263.119,6.081,packed we for example have the user
2265.119,4.081,research course then and many other ones
2269.28,5.2,if uh teaching will be
2271.839,4.24,organized in hybrid mode or remotely
2274.48,3.68,then of course you know maybe you can
2276.079,4.081,participate in part of those
2278.16,3.84,but i i would recommend uh you know
2280.16,5.199,coming in in september meet the other
2282.0,3.359,students and myself
2285.76,4.0,so i'm saying that it's possible to do
2287.52,3.839,it in a way that you propose here so
2289.76,4.24,starting in one america
2291.359,5.521,you're certainly going to miss something
2294.0,4.88,i would say that we our university has a
2296.88,4.56,lot of orientation
2298.88,4.8,when this study is sought to help you
2301.44,5.36,find new friends and get to know
2303.68,5.6,everything so in that sense it's also
2306.8,4.559,valuable to be here but
2309.28,5.68,but as undimensionally it's it's
2311.359,4.961,partially possible to start remotely
2314.96,4.8,and then
2316.32,5.519,hi i am wondering how hci and biasing
2319.76,4.319,data analysis can be related in
2321.839,6.561,interactive data analysis can you
2324.079,4.321,suggest some projects to check out later
2328.88,4.0,the bayesian data analysis is working
2331.119,4.401,with pretty arcane
2332.88,5.199,tools you know building for example on r
2335.52,4.48,and stan and things like that
2338.079,4.401,and you know there's there's there's a
2340.0,4.079,big need to develop a base in that data
2342.48,4.56,analysis itself
2344.079,5.361,uh to exploit uh interactive uh
2347.04,4.799,interaction techniques and uh
2349.44,4.08,interactive visualizations and so on and
2351.839,2.961,that's something that uh
2353.52,3.04,and other ones who are teaching the
2354.8,4.16,bayesian data analysis for driving
2356.56,4.4,classes of like 400 people that they're
2358.96,3.76,keenly looking at and
2360.96,3.28,we've been jointly supervising some some
2362.72,2.72,massive students for example on those
2364.24,3.52,topics
2365.44,4.159,right now they don't have contact so if
2367.76,4.24,you if you learn base and data analysis
2369.599,3.921,you could learn about the theory and
2372.0,3.52,sort of the programming aspects of
2373.52,4.48,bayesian data analysis but if you wanted
2375.52,4.559,to do something that connects hci you
2378.0,4.88,know then it would be up to some sort of
2380.079,4.801,interesting research project maybe or
2382.88,3.92,and then we also have the danger the
2384.88,3.12,info information visualization course
2386.8,2.96,where you know some of those things
2388.0,3.68,would come together and you would learn
2389.76,4.56,some ways of plotting data in
2391.68,4.56,interactive and powerful ways
2394.32,4.72,so there will be some contact points but
2396.24,5.839,uh but not a direct course at the
2399.04,3.039,intersection of these things
2402.48,4.08,okay
2403.599,5.52,well then we already talked a bit about
2406.56,4.96,taking part-time jobs so is there a
2409.119,4.401,possibility to participate as a research
2411.52,4.24,helper or something similar at all to
2413.52,4.16,tackle to be rent
2415.76,3.92,um i think auntie already mentioned that
2417.68,4.48,yes it is possible but uh katya could
2419.68,6.639,you tell about your experiences as
2422.16,4.159,you told us you have have been working
2427.04,3.76,yeah i've been working part-time like
2428.8,3.039,during my residence permit i'm allowed
2430.8,3.519,to work
2431.839,5.52,25 hours a week but all my pos but all
2434.319,5.841,of my positions were a bit a bit less
2437.359,4.321,just to be able to manage my studies and
2440.16,4.64,work well
2441.68,5.36,um and i worked in a user interfaces lab
2444.8,5.84,and i also was a teaching assistant
2447.04,5.44,twice for different courses
2450.64,5.52,as a research assistant
2452.48,4.879,i was uh like i was helping uh people
2456.16,3.28,from the lab
2457.359,4.48,like with mostly with the things i like
2459.44,4.24,to do like information visualization i
2461.839,4.48,was doing a lot of graphs to support
2463.68,3.679,like research but also it was an
2466.319,3.121,excellent
2467.359,4.401,opportunity to learn something new like
2469.44,4.72,for example i worked with the results of
2471.76,5.44,eye tracker studies which i have
2474.16,5.84,very little connection to beforehand or
2477.2,5.52,also like during the summer during my
2480.0,5.76,summer position this year i worked with
2482.72,5.28,the uc oakland who is
2485.76,4.64,working on like a car model which can
2488.0,5.2,simulate a driver and it was a very
2490.4,4.88,fascinating topic like i know pretty
2493.2,4.159,much nothing about cars but it was so
2495.28,4.48,interesting to dive into this field i
2497.359,3.601,like to do something once again with my
2499.76,4.16,own hands
2500.96,5.2,uh there so and there also i know that
2503.92,4.159,there are a lot of opportunities to
2506.16,4.88,work in different labs and then
2508.079,4.0,different like courses and departments
2511.04,3.68,so
2512.079,4.0,sometimes it works this just you find a
2514.72,4.32,person which interests you as a
2516.079,5.52,professor and you can write them to ask
2519.04,3.68,where the where they are hiring right
2521.599,3.52,now
2522.72,2.399,so yeah
2525.28,5.92,thanks for your experiences
2528.8,5.6,um then is there a chance to get
2531.2,6.24,involved in hci projects before the
2534.4,5.52,master start as jakadarenov mentioned if
2537.44,4.56,yes where can i find those
2539.92,4.399,so katya where did you find the
2542.0,3.76,information and anti do you also have a
2544.319,4.241,comment on this
2545.76,4.4,well alta has a summer internship for
2548.56,4.4,students
2550.16,6.0,which i was part of it i think it is
2552.96,4.8,yearly company so you can apply
2556.16,4.48,some somewhere in the spring if i
2557.76,4.8,remember correctly
2560.64,4.0,yeah we every year we get the same same
2562.56,3.68,questions and there are two things that
2564.64,3.76,are happening there's the internship
2566.24,3.52,programs by which we we get some some
2568.4,3.36,students and get to know them there's
2569.76,4.48,the us it's called husky
2571.76,4.24,as all the school of science uh summer
2574.24,3.119,internship program and we're part of
2576.0,3.44,that so every year we publish some
2577.359,4.48,projects and students come already in
2579.44,4.879,like a june and they do that
2581.839,3.28,they also paid positions by the way
2584.319,2.961,and
2585.119,5.041,the other thing is that then we have uh
2587.28,4.88,aldo hci education teams channel so in
2590.16,4.64,microsoft these teams application
2592.16,4.08,there's a channel that is dedicated for
2594.8,4.16,acs students
2596.24,5.599,we publish our job uh positions you know
2598.96,4.56,like tara positions there and also some
2601.839,3.121,sometimes students just email me that
2603.52,3.68,you know do you have anything and then
2604.96,3.6,typically or often we have right and i
2607.2,4.24,kind of guarantee that everybody gets
2608.56,7.12,them but then we do have constant
2611.44,4.24,you know look out for our asymptotes
2617.2,3.52,thanks
2618.4,3.52,then there are two questions by one
2620.72,3.52,participant
2621.92,5.28,first do you have specific classes about
2624.24,2.96,accessibility
2627.359,6.0,uh yes and no so unfortunately uh we we
2630.96,3.76,did have something on the topic but
2633.359,3.76,you know that that person left and the
2634.72,4.96,course doesn't exist anymore
2637.119,5.361,um but we do cover accessibility related
2639.68,5.12,things on undedigated courses so for
2642.48,4.08,example in the introduction to hci uh
2644.8,3.76,there's something about it and then on
2646.56,3.759,my course uh we talk about visual
2648.56,4.16,perception models and we touch on
2650.319,4.401,accessibility related things like
2652.72,4.24,maybe color blindness or water
2654.72,4.399,deficiency and stuff like that but it's
2656.96,4.32,not systematically covered in our force
2659.119,4.641,offerings unfortunately
2661.28,4.64,we do have a strategic initiative at
2663.76,4.24,alton university compost to make our
2665.92,4.88,campus more accessible and there's
2668.0,4.72,serious effort to do that
2670.8,3.039,given that you know i'm not seeing that
2672.72,3.04,so i'm not
2673.839,4.401,not able to sort of um
2675.76,4.319,to tell frankly how good it is right so
2678.24,4.8,you have to turn to somebody else to get
2680.079,5.52,a honest opinion on this
2683.04,5.039,yeah that was maybe the second half of
2685.599,4.881,the question that how do how does all
2688.079,3.841,the create students with disability
2690.48,4.4,so
2691.92,5.439,inclusion is really important to us and
2694.88,4.88,in in terms of our
2697.359,5.281,facilities we try to make them as
2699.76,5.599,accessible as possible and currently
2702.64,3.84,they we are renovating the campus to
2705.359,3.76,improve
2706.48,4.24,in that sense and i think also our
2709.119,5.121,studies
2710.72,5.52,now making them remote for example is is
2714.24,2.72,a part of that making them accessible
2716.24,2.8,but
2716.96,4.0,about that how studies are organized
2719.04,2.88,maybe auntie do you want to comment that
2720.96,2.0,part
2721.92,3.52,well i mean
2722.96,5.04,there's no shift toward uh hybrid and
2725.44,4.8,then physical teaching
2728.0,4.96,but some some some courses are still in
2730.24,5.2,a remote mode that doesn't mean that
2732.96,4.639,that's more accessible by the way so i
2735.44,4.639,don't think aldo has yet
2737.599,5.201,got as far as like offering uh closed
2740.079,4.0,captioning subtitles to lectures and
2742.8,3.519,things like that
2744.079,4.801,but there's a strategy to improve in
2746.319,4.561,that respect and i i think that those
2748.88,2.719,people would be very willing to listen
2750.88,3.36,to
2751.599,2.641,suggestions
2757.92,5.679,okay it was there's more specific that
2760.24,5.68,uh the person is dyslexic person and has
2763.599,4.24,some problems with spelling and reading
2765.92,4.0,speed
2767.839,4.0,well i mean if you made it as far as
2769.92,3.12,getting a bachelor degree in a related
2771.839,3.201,area then
2773.04,2.799,most likely or
2775.04,2.24,okay
2775.839,4.961,i don't think there's any
2777.28,3.52,anything more than that required
2784.079,7.04,then let's find next question
2788.079,5.121,the person is a software developer with
2791.119,3.121,skillset in machine learning and data
2793.2,3.68,science
2794.24,5.44,i don't have any hci or design
2796.88,6.719,background do i stand any chance to be
2799.68,6.159,admitted if i apply yeah uh so this is
2803.599,4.161,from uh maria so this is this is a good
2805.839,3.681,good question and i i would strongly
2807.76,2.72,recommend applying because we we have
2809.52,3.04,many
2810.48,3.28,students with a similar profile they run
2812.56,2.88,you know doing something in machine
2813.76,3.44,learning data science computer science
2815.44,3.36,software development and then they
2817.2,3.119,decided that okay i want to do something
2818.8,3.44,more human-centric
2820.319,4.241,and how this works in practice is that
2822.24,4.4,then we ask you to take some basic
2824.56,4.16,courses on we have in the very first
2826.64,4.24,period we have introduction to hci you
2828.72,4.08,know let's take that course right and
2830.88,4.0,start building from that i think it's
2832.8,3.84,really really healthy that you have a
2834.88,3.52,technical core that you can build on
2836.64,3.76,because some of the later courses will
2838.4,3.6,be technically more involved on the
2840.4,3.76,other hand if you have you know design
2842.0,4.319,or hci background then you do need to
2844.16,3.6,take some of the more technical courses
2846.319,3.841,in the beginning so that you prep your
2847.76,4.079,way uh to those
2850.16,2.88,more challenging masters level courses
2851.839,3.361,in
2853.04,4.24,nci
2855.2,3.52,and i think important over here is to
2857.28,3.76,write your motivation on the
2858.72,5.119,motivational letter why do you want to
2861.04,4.799,change your career for example
2863.839,3.921,auntie do you have a comment on this
2865.839,4.0,yeah exactly i know we every year we
2867.76,4.88,accept people who have no
2869.839,5.52,aci background so please don't take that
2872.64,4.24,as a requirement
2875.359,2.881,it is beneficial if you've taken
2876.88,2.88,something but you know believe me we
2878.24,3.44,have pretty good offering in the
2879.76,5.04,beginning of the semesters to
2881.68,3.12,start learning that as well
2885.44,4.72,okay then there's a uh question i
2888.0,4.559,haven't completed my bachelor's degree
2890.16,7.36,yet if i finish my degree in september
2892.559,4.961,while following the lessons is a problem
2898.8,3.0,um
2902.4,5.12,i think one thing is to check the uh
2905.04,5.12,general um admissions
2907.52,4.4,instructions aldo has
2910.16,4.32,i think
2911.92,3.76,i can say that the diploma
2914.48,3.28,should be
2915.68,5.52,like in the admissions office before you
2917.76,5.28,start the classes here
2921.2,4.8,but the classes don't start immediately
2923.04,2.96,in september so
2926.839,5.081,yeah um i think the strict deadlines are
2930.72,2.0,available
2931.92,2.56,uh
2932.72,4.0,you know on our website so you can
2934.48,5.28,actually check that from there
2936.72,5.839,so our admissions websites will answer
2939.76,5.28,to your question
2942.559,5.681,uh then um
2945.04,5.2,what's the admission rate to hc
2948.24,4.4,a
2950.24,3.68,uh i can't recall the number i'm sorry
2952.64,3.52,because
2953.92,3.439,i'm actually in charge of the admission
2956.16,3.6,and uh
2957.359,4.24,and uh we got a i don't know maybe 100
2959.76,3.599,applications and we offer something like
2961.599,3.601,15
2963.359,3.681,maybe that gives you an idea but you
2965.2,3.919,know you should not look at the uh
2967.04,3.76,acceptance rate per se right because we
2969.119,3.601,did all you know all over the world we
2970.8,3.84,get applications these days
2972.72,5.68,and you should just focus on on making
2974.64,3.76,an excellent application yourself
2981.119,4.081,um
2981.92,5.76,then i couldn't find any hci courses in
2985.2,5.28,fitec course it's not sure if i missed
2987.68,7.36,would really like to get some basics so
2990.48,6.96,are we offering feeder courses like uh
2995.04,4.0,not not in this major atmosphere yeah i
2997.44,3.84,mean if you want to do something like
2999.04,4.4,that in your specialization and combine
3001.28,4.4,you know hci and feedback you know maybe
3003.44,4.32,we can come up with something
3005.68,3.84,i have not had a student before who
3007.76,3.2,would like to do that
3009.52,3.039,and we're open enough
3010.96,3.76,yeah
3012.559,4.081,then i have a background from university
3014.72,4.16,of applied sciences are there any
3016.64,4.479,special requirements or extra courses
3018.88,5.12,needed to take for people not from
3021.119,4.881,university background
3024.0,4.16,yeah normally we would recommend some
3026.0,3.839,more uh technical computer science
3028.16,4.159,course for example we have excellent
3029.839,4.72,course courses by uh lucas and their
3032.319,3.841,customers are teaching the the basics of
3034.559,3.601,computer science and not just
3036.16,3.439,programming but computer science as a
3038.16,2.8,science
3039.599,2.48,and those would be quite quite
3040.96,2.72,recommended
3042.079,4.24,because you get certain basic concepts
3043.68,5.2,there uh in terms of like how algorithms
3046.319,3.841,work and so on that you can then apply
3048.88,3.12,in
3050.16,4.56,that that is somewhat required you know
3052.0,4.24,when you for example apply optimization
3054.72,2.32,or machine learning
3056.24,2.079,um
3057.04,3.76,in the way that we're doing in these
3058.319,3.76,courses but you know it's um you know we
3060.8,2.799,have had
3062.079,2.881,students from you know university of
3063.599,3.681,life sciences
3064.96,5.28,uh and then we then direct them to take
3067.28,2.96,some courses like that
3072.079,2.801,okay i think we have time for a couple
3074.24,2.879,of
3074.88,5.679,more questions anything you wish to ask
3077.119,5.681,from katya who is our student or
3080.559,4.56,something else we still have few minutes
3082.8,2.319,left
3090.559,5.56,and thank you so far for that really
3092.88,3.239,good questions
3100.24,5.119,oh maria has a question
3102.96,2.399,um
3106.96,5.44,yeah the feeder is is open university
3109.599,6.24,and um are there any open university
3112.4,5.52,courses on on the topic
3115.839,4.72,on the topic of fittech i don't know on
3117.92,6.08,the topic of hci i also don't know
3120.559,5.04,uh vtec is the organization but um i
3124.0,3.839,think they
3125.599,5.281,they might be a bit more general the
3127.839,4.881,course is over there and not as special
3130.88,2.88,as hei
3132.72,5.32,yeah
3133.76,4.28,yeah i i don't really know that
3139.599,6.24,and then uh question uh what can you
3142.64,6.08,tell us about the joint program with eit
3145.839,4.641,digital for human computer interaction
3148.72,4.24,yeah i can i can tell a lot about that
3150.48,4.8,because i'm in charge of the exit year
3152.96,4.0,on that program so it consists of two
3155.28,4.4,years one
3156.96,4.72,in one site in europe that's part of the
3159.68,3.6,chain of universities like in paris or
3161.68,3.439,stockholm
3163.28,3.2,and the other one here
3165.119,4.801,and i'm in charge of the the
3166.48,5.2,specialization on computational uh hci
3169.92,3.12,so you know very much similar things
3171.68,3.36,that i just showed
3173.04,4.24,uh typically you know you would start in
3175.04,4.16,in september take a course in user
3177.28,3.36,research and computational design and
3179.2,2.639,then
3180.64,3.36,starting in january you would do a
3181.839,4.881,master's thesis here in helsinki with
3184.0,5.119,the company typically but sometimes
3186.72,3.68,with academic groups as well
3189.119,3.121,we have some really good experiences
3190.4,3.679,with ert students
3192.24,4.079,they also you know it's quite intense
3194.079,4.561,because you have to go to two sites but
3196.319,4.8,then again you know get uh pretty uh
3198.64,4.8,good networking uh out of that and you
3201.119,4.401,get uh quite diverse experiences and
3203.44,4.08,typically they land uh good job
3205.52,3.92,positions and some of them go to do with
3207.52,4.079,expositions as well
3209.44,5.36,so i recommend also considering that one
3211.599,3.201,it's a good program
3214.96,5.44,if you are interested in the double
3216.8,5.44,degree which the eit is uh kindly check
3220.4,3.84,the admissions
3222.24,4.079,period then or the application period
3224.24,3.68,because it's a bit different than this
3226.319,3.361,one we are talking
3227.92,3.04,at the moment
3229.68,4.639,so please
3230.96,6.56,please be specific on that
3234.319,5.121,um i think one more question we still
3237.52,5.44,have time so
3239.44,7.0,thanks so far about the questions and
3242.96,3.48,anything else
3260.64,4.56,and i i also want to welcome if you have
3262.559,4.881,any questions just email me or on
3265.2,5.04,uh we're happy to help
3267.44,5.36,yeah and and you can also send questions
3270.24,4.319,to admissions at all the dot fi so if
3272.8,4.319,you have anything about the
3274.559,5.04,how to apply so they also help you with
3277.119,5.2,the technical side of applying to our
3279.599,2.72,university
3282.64,5.6,but if no further questions so thank you
3285.76,3.92,so much for participating and good luck
3288.24,3.839,with applying
3289.68,3.6,and we hope to see you here in the
3292.079,3.76,canvas
