0.0,4.16,Do I need to know data structure algorithms
2.32,3.12,and competitive recording for data
4.16,2.56,science career?
5.44,3.44,When you're talking about data science
6.72,4.64,career there are four main roles- data
8.88,4.639,"analyst, data scientist, data engineer, and"
11.36,4.72,machine learning engineer. For data
13.519,4.401,analyst and data scientist role even if
16.08,3.359,you have basic knowledge of data
17.92,3.6,structure algorithms and competitive
19.439,3.121,coding it's good enough
21.52,2.72,because
22.56,4.4,as a data analyst... So let's say data
24.24,5.52,scientist you are building a model
26.96,5.84,you are doing some analytics but you're
29.76,5.28,not building an enterprise level big
32.8,4.32,software system.
35.04,5.039,So many times I have seen data
37.12,4.8,scientists will build this poc.
40.079,6.64,they will build
41.92,7.76,a model or small jupiter notebook in
46.719,5.68,dev environment or alpha environment and
49.68,5.519,once they have proven their story their
52.399,5.121,data story they will give the model and
55.199,5.52,their analytics to some software
57.52,6.32,engineers who will then integrate
60.719,5.201,that analytics into enterprise software.
63.84,4.08,Many times they will write data
65.92,3.68,scientists will write machine learning
67.92,3.04,model and they will handle machine
69.6,2.879,learning models
70.96,3.44,to software engineers and software
72.479,5.201,engineers will integrate
74.4,4.56,them into their big software enterprise
77.68,3.119,system.
78.96,3.44,So the role of data analysis and data
80.799,2.64,scientists is
82.4,3.359,mainly
83.439,4.241,having a dominant knowledge. They will
85.759,3.841,"look at the given problem, they will come"
87.68,5.2,"up with some data story,"
89.6,5.28,"some analytics, some predictive model"
92.88,3.36,and that's it they present it to
94.88,3.84,stakeholders
96.24,4.4,and then maybe they write some
98.72,2.96,"servers around it, you know some http"
100.64,3.36,servers
101.68,4.88,around the models but the remaining part
104.0,3.52,which is integration with main software
106.56,3.12,system
107.52,4.48,is being done by software engineers. And
109.68,4.719,"for this reason as a data analyst, data"
112.0,5.36,"scientist, even if you don't have"
114.399,4.72,in-depth understanding of competitive
117.36,3.6,"coding, data structure algorithm it is"
119.119,3.441,okay. I mean of course
120.96,4.479,you're writing code in Python you need
122.56,5.759,to know about dictionaries and
125.439,4.96,lists and some basic data structures but
128.319,4.721,during the data analyst or data
130.399,4.641,scientist interview I don't think they
133.04,4.16,"will go too much in depth, you know. They"
135.04,4.96,might not ask you questions on like
137.2,4.48,binary trees and all kind of crazy data
140.0,3.12,structures.
141.68,3.919,If you're applying for big companies
143.12,4.88,"like Amazon, Google things might be a"
145.599,4.081,little complicated and
148.0,4.0,there even for data scientists role they
149.68,4.639,might ask you competitive
152.0,5.28,coding related questions
154.319,4.401,but this I'm talking about major like 90
157.28,3.36,of the companies.
158.72,3.76,Now let's talk about data engineer and
160.64,3.92,machine learning engineer role what do
162.48,3.839,they do in their day-to-day life.
164.56,3.2,As a machine learning engineers I have
166.319,4.161,seen
167.76,5.04,in many companies they will be
170.48,4.56,writing code in C plus or Java they
172.8,6.0,might be building their own custom
175.04,5.68,models that suits their business needs
178.8,3.68,and for this reason
180.72,4.56,these people are building very
182.48,4.8,performant scalable
185.28,4.319,software systems and they need to be
187.28,4.16,good software engineer and whenever we
189.599,3.92,say you need to be good software
191.44,3.439,engineer which means you need to be
193.519,3.601,really good in
194.879,4.64,"data structure, algorithm, and competitive"
197.12,3.839,coding. So machine learning and data
199.519,3.44,"engineer, machine learning engineer and"
200.959,4.0,data engineer they are
202.959,2.961,basically software engineers
204.959,2.961,but
205.92,3.92,they are working in
207.92,4.72,as a data engineer. You're working in
209.84,4.959,"like Apache, Spark, Hadoop and all those"
212.64,4.959,you know big data systems whereas a
214.799,4.881,machine learning engineer you might be
217.599,3.121,working on computer vision or NLP
219.68,3.6,problem.
220.72,4.159,but you might be using c=C
223.28,3.679,so Java as a programming language they
224.879,4.321,use Python as a programming language too
226.959,4.401,but they have to be
229.2,3.92,very good not only in machine learning
231.36,4.48,and statistics but they need to be a
233.12,5.52,good software engineer and as I said a
235.84,5.44,good software engineer means a solid
238.64,4.72,knowledge in data structure algorithms
241.28,4.239,and competitive coding when you know
243.36,5.2,data structures and algorithms in depth
245.519,6.481,what happens is you can write a very
248.56,6.399,efficient software which performs really
252.0,4.0,well the kind of software which scales
254.959,2.4,well.
256.0,3.68,"Talking about data structures, for"
257.359,4.081,"example, you want to find there is a"
259.68,4.239,record you want to find unique elements
261.44,3.36,in it. You have to use set if you use
263.919,2.481,list
264.8,3.44,your program will work but it will not
266.4,3.359,be efficient. Now if you have a good
268.24,3.679,understanding of what's the difference
269.759,4.561,between list and set data structure then
271.919,4.161,you can use that sense of judgment and
274.32,4.319,you know use the appropriate data
276.08,6.24,structure which makes your program
278.639,6.081,more compact scalable and performant and
282.32,5.04,this is the reason why as a machine
284.72,5.84,learning engineer or a data engineer
287.36,4.64,you have to be good in these topics.
290.56,3.359,You can go through various job
292.0,4.639,requirements on machine learning
293.919,4.481,"engineer data scientist, data analyst and"
296.639,3.441,in the qualification you know you will
298.4,3.68,find that
300.08,2.88,sometimes many companies they say okay
302.08,2.48,we have a
302.96,4.16,position for machine learning engineer
304.56,4.4,but those guys are not really machine
307.12,4.639,learning engineers they might be doing
308.96,4.48,some one-off analytics or they might be
311.759,2.481,maybe data scientists
313.44,3.759,so
314.24,5.44,job descriptions might vary but all of
317.199,4.161,this i'm telling based on my own 17
319.68,3.2,years of industry experience I have been
321.36,5.279,interviewing for
322.88,5.84,last 10 or 12 years so far and I have
326.639,4.081,interacted with so many people through
328.72,4.08,my Youtube channel who have
330.72,4.8,interviewed and who have got a job. So I
332.8,4.32,hope these tips are giving you some
335.52,3.84,understanding of importance of these
337.12,3.919,topics in various career roles.
