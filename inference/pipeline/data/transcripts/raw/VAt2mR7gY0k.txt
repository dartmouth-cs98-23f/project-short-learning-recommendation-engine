0.03,4.95,what is a data structure what is an
2.85,4.56,algorithm if you look at standard
4.98,4.38,definitions of these terms it's easy to
7.41,4.349,think that they are super complicated
9.36,6.66,concepts how do we really interpret
11.759,6.181,these definitions I like to think about
16.02,4.5,data structures and algorithms using the
17.94,5.099,following analogy let's say you've been
20.52,4.169,buying a few books recently right now
23.039,4.56,you have a pretty simple organization
24.689,5.58,scheme as soon as you get a book you
27.599,4.741,stack it on top of the last book this
30.269,3.931,ingenious organization scheme has been
32.34,3.989,patented by college students all over
34.2,5.91,the world and has proved to be highly
36.329,6.841,effective now let's say you want to find
40.11,4.949,a specific book from this stack how
43.17,4.59,would you do it the most straightforward
45.059,4.621,way to find a book is by taking a book
47.76,4.389,off the stack until you find the book
49.68,6.16,that you're looking for
52.149,5.521,I know what you're thinking what does
55.84,4.53,this have to do with data structures and
57.67,5.909,algorithms but believe it or not you
60.37,5.97,just saw a textbook example of a data
63.579,4.47,structure and an algorithm in this
66.34,5.43,example you can think of a data
68.049,6.511,structure as our stack of books and the
71.77,4.8,algorithm we use to find a book is the
74.56,4.68,process of taking books off the top of
76.57,8.28,the stack until we find the book that we
79.24,7.95,are looking for but as time goes on and
84.85,4.019,you start getting a lot of books you
87.19,4.679,decide to become a little bit more
88.869,6.151,organized you decide to buy a bookshelf
91.869,6.36,and put all your books in alphabetical
95.02,5.639,order by the authors what do we do now
98.229,5.161,if we want to find a book you probably
100.659,4.861,would start in the middle and slowly
103.39,4.67,hone in to the appropriate place of the
105.52,5.099,book based on the order of the alphabet
108.06,4.839,here the data structure would be the
110.619,4.29,bookshelf organized alphabetically and
112.899,5.491,your algorithm would be your search
114.909,6.05,process now let's say as you get even
118.39,5.52,more books you decide to change your
120.959,5.41,organization scheme one more time you
123.91,6.03,now basically have a small library and
126.369,7.041,each self is split based on fiction or
129.94,6.45,nonfiction and then the respective genre
133.41,5.65,within each genre you keep the same
136.39,5.489,alphabetical Organization of authors and
139.06,4.77,now if you want to find a book you can
141.879,5.101,narrow your search to the corresponding
143.83,6.12,section here your data structure is this
146.98,5.339,hierarchical organization of books based
149.95,4.679,on genre and your algorithm is the
152.319,5.551,process by which you identified the
154.629,5.94,genre and then found your book so taking
157.87,5.25,a step away from this analogy I think a
160.569,4.081,really simple way to think about data
163.12,3.93,structures and algorithms is the
164.65,5.25,following the data structure is a way to
167.05,5.73,organize information and an algorithm is
169.9,4.419,a way to process information to reach an
172.78,4.15,end goal
174.319,5.521,some of the ways of organizing and using
176.93,4.289,information are not at all obvious but
179.84,3.569,they all have their strengths and
181.219,4.951,weaknesses and a lot of the subject is
183.409,4.381,about understanding these trade-offs in
186.17,3.989,the following videos I'll introduce some
187.79,4.199,fundamental data structures talk about
190.159,4.7,how you would go about designing them
191.989,5.011,and then talk about their performance
194.859,4.361,after we get through some key data
197.0,3.989,structures we'll get into some important
199.22,3.719,algorithms they use these data
200.989,6.241,structures to solve a variety of
202.939,6.121,problems if you enjoyed this video I
