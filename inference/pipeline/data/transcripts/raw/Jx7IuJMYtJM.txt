0.72,5.28,"In my previous video, I talked about what quantum 
computing is and what makes it special. But as  "
6.0,4.4,"a developer, I'm sure you want to know how to 
actually write a piece of code that would run  "
10.4,5.12,"on a common computer. But before we dive into 
that, let's just do a little bit of a quick  "
15.52,10.16,"recap. Instead of the classical bits of 0s and 1s, 
quantum computers use qubits. A qubit can be a 0,  "
27.12,8.08,"a 1, or any linear combination of the two. 
And that is what we called a superposition.  "
36.8,6.32,"We can also entangle multiple qubits. So their
states become strongly correlated.  In order  "
43.12,5.36,"to change the states of qubits, we apply 
a series of gates, similar to the classical  "
48.48,5.36,"logic gates. And in the end, we want to measure 
these qubits so we can get the results.  "
55.36,6.8,"So how do we take all these concepts into 
code? And the answer is simple. We use a  "
62.16,4.8,"quantum software development kit. In 
this video, we will be using Qiskit.  "
69.28,3.12,Which is the most widely used quantum SDK today.  
73.28,4.48,"Qiskit is based on Python, which is fairly simple 
to learn, even if you've never used it before.  "
79.12,6.72,"So let's write a simple program in his Qiskit. In this program, we will use two qubits.  "
88.96,5.92,"We will put one into superposition, entangle it with the other, and then  "
94.88,4.96,"do a measurement of both of them. And 
of course, all that is done using gates.  "
102.0,17.2,"So let's start by importing quantum circuit from 
Qiskit. We then can create a quantum circuit "
124.56,3.28,"with two quantum registers 
and two classical registers.  "
129.68,2.48,The quantum registers are used for quantum  
133.84,10.0,"computation. One for each qubit. And the classical 
registers are used to store the measured results.  "
145.04,4.08,"We need a classical registers because 
even though the physical world is quantum,  "
149.76,3.04,"the majority of the classical 
world is still classical.  "
153.44,4.56,"And the classical registers allow us to bring 
quantum information back into the classical world.  "
160.48,3.84,"So the next thing we want to do is 
apply some gates. And in this program,  "
164.32,5.68,"we're going to apply two gates. The 
first one is the Hadamard gate "
171.92,7.2,"on qubit 0. The Hadamard gate puts 
the qubit into a superposition between 0  "
179.12,5.84,"and 1. That means it now has an equal 
chance of being measured a 0 or 1.  "
186.72,4.48,"The next gate we need is the control 
not gate,  or ""cx"" for short.  "
195.44,6.8,The control not gate is a conditional two qubits gate. It has a control qubit
204.08,1.04,and the target qubit.
210.48,4.0,"Without superposition, the control 
not gate is fairly simple to understand.  "
215.6,8.08,"That is, it is as if the state of the control qubit is 
1, then you flip the state of the target qubit.  "
224.24,1.92,And that's why it's called control not.  
229.04,4.48,"And because the states of least two 
qubits are now strongly correlated,  "
233.52,4.8,"we now say they are entangled. So the 
last thing we want to do is actually do  "
238.32,5.52,"measurements so we can get the outputs. And we 
do this by calling the measure all function.  "
246.32,6.8,"And there you have it. We just wrote a simple 
quantum program using Qiskit. Now, if you take  "
253.12,5.2,"this program and run it a bunch of times on an 
ideal quantum computer, you'll find out that  "
258.96,7.36,"there's a 50% chance of the outputs being 00 and 
50% chance of it being 11. But you would never  "
266.32,10.08,"be a 01 or 10. The 50/50 of the first 
qubit comes from the superposition. And while  "
276.4,5.6,"we didn't explicitly change the state of the 
second qubit, it got changed anyway because  "
282.0,4.48,"it is entangled with the first qubit. 
So it changes with the first qubit.  "
292.08,5.52,"So in this program, we created a quantum 
circuit which operates at the same level  "
297.6,5.92,"as classical assembly language and allows you 
to efficiently manipulate the qubits directly.  "
304.08,3.84,"However, if you're not fond of 
playing with low level circuits,  "
307.92,7.12,"Qiskit also offers a number of higher 
level algorithms. For example, Qiskit has  "
315.68,6.32,"a package focusing on machine learning that has 
a number of pre-built classes. You can take a  "
322.0,8.64,"quantum kernel class, use it to train and test 
data. You can then take this trained quantum  "
330.64,5.68,"kernel and pass it into a classical algorithm 
such as the support vector classification  "
336.32,5.44,"from scikit-learn. Then you can then 
accelerate your classical application.  "
