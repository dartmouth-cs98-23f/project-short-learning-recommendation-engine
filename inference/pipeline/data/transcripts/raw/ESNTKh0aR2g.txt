5.279,4.32,in this video we're going to discuss the
6.799,5.121,differences between relational and nosql
9.599,4.401,databases
11.92,4.08,most popular and leading database
14.0,5.119,systems are relational databases which
16.0,5.68,store data in tables columns rows
19.119,3.92,and it's pretty similar to a spreadsheet
21.68,4.24,like excel
23.039,3.921,all the data in each column has the same
25.92,2.96,format
26.96,4.079,all the data in each row represents a
28.88,5.199,single object such as a person object
31.039,3.841,for a contact list or a car object for a
34.079,3.841,card
34.88,6.16,dealer inventory list
37.92,5.76,they also support sql or sql and they're
41.04,5.359,ideal for databases that require
43.68,5.12,accuracy for all transactions such as
46.399,4.401,like a banking database you want to make
48.8,4.88,sure that all the financial records are
50.8,4.32,really accurate airline reservations so
53.68,3.039,that you know people's flights aren't
55.12,3.599,messed up and don't ruin their travel
56.719,5.84,plans and so on
58.719,6.08,big data is large hard to manage volumes
62.559,5.041,of data that may be both structured or
64.799,5.121,unstructured and companies collect
67.6,4.559,tons of data from their users
69.92,4.72,but it's what they do with the data that
72.159,5.441,matters big data can be analyzed using
74.64,5.28,tools like tableau to visualize the data
77.6,4.159,and help answer questions that will help
79.92,4.0,make the company
81.759,6.0,better by making better decisions in
83.92,5.68,certain strategic business moves
87.759,4.481,relational database systems were not
89.6,4.479,initially designed for big data
92.24,4.48,and that caused many non-relational
94.079,4.481,systems to become popular and the most
96.72,4.719,popular type of these non-relational
98.56,4.48,systems is called a nosql database or
101.439,4.561,nosql
103.04,5.359,which stores data as key value pairs
106.0,5.119,typically in memory and is optimized for
108.399,5.04,big data and although the name nosql
111.119,4.881,suggests that it doesn't support sql
113.439,5.201,most nosql databases have added support
116.0,5.84,for sql so now nosql
118.64,5.439,means not only sql
121.84,2.959,most database systems were originally
124.079,3.121,for
124.799,4.8,profit commercial software such as
127.2,3.839,oracle which requires you know expensive
129.599,3.521,licensing
131.039,4.241,and currently there's open source
133.12,4.32,databases that are really popular and
135.28,5.36,they're free and there's a community of
137.44,6.879,developers that inspect modify copy the
140.64,5.679,database without any fee or license
144.319,4.321,and there are many different open source
146.319,6.0,databases that are both relational and
148.64,6.64,no sql and examples include mysql
152.319,6.081,sqlite firebase those are the most
155.28,6.56,popular open source relational databases
158.4,4.68,and popular open source nosql databases
161.84,7.8,include
163.08,6.56,postgresql mongodb mariadb and redis
172.56,2.08,you
