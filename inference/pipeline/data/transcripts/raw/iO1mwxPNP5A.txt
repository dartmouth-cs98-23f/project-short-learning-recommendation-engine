0.0,3.659,Nobel prize winning Economist Paul
1.92,4.439,Krugman made an ominous prediction
3.659,4.561,recently saying AI like chat GPT won't
6.359,3.721,change the world anytime soon the reason
8.22,4.2,this is terrifying is that he's the same
10.08,4.019,guy who also predicted in the 1990s that
12.42,3.12,the internet was about as game changing
14.099,3.18,as a fax machine when it comes to
15.54,3.48,programming I've already seen enough the
17.279,4.141,need to memorize syntax for programming
19.02,4.8,is done the future is deterministic AI
21.42,3.66,pseudocode and the future is now uh
23.82,4.08,ladies and gentlemen if you will look
25.08,5.16,right here today's video is yet another
27.9,4.08,react.js tutorial just one of Millions
30.24,3.78,on the internet but it's no ordinary
31.98,4.079,tutorial it's the first tutorial to
34.02,3.84,leverage the full power of AI to write
36.059,3.18,code like a 10x developer even if you've
37.86,2.94,never written a single line of code in
39.239,3.181,your life what's crazy though is that
40.8,3.24,this tutorial can be applied to any
42.42,3.24,language or framework once you know some
44.04,3.359,basic programming principles and how to
45.66,3.36,prompt like a pro you can build almost
47.399,4.021,anything in your imagination but it's
49.02,4.199,not as simple as just asking chatgpt to
51.42,3.54,build you a react app you will need some
53.219,3.66,domain knowledge and understand how to
54.96,3.54,execute and validate the code that the
56.879,3.061,AI spits out let's go ahead and get
58.5,3.3,started with your AI printing
59.94,3.599,masterclass I'm assuming you know
61.8,3.6,nothing about react other than it's a
63.539,3.241,library for building uis I could sit
65.4,3.719,here and teach you about react and ask
66.78,4.26,you to buy my 500 react course but the
69.119,3.721,truth is that gpt4 can teach you better
71.04,3.119,than I can I hate to admit it but it's
72.84,3.0,true if you want to learn something you
74.159,3.301,know absolutely nothing about go ahead
75.84,3.3,and prompt it to explain it like you're
77.46,3.9,five in this case it'll explain how
79.14,4.08,react.js components are like Lego bricks
81.36,3.72,but for building websites which is the
83.22,3.3,perfect metaphor from there I ask it for
85.08,3.06,the most important Concepts that I
86.52,3.72,should know it then explains components
88.14,3.659,State and props and hooks if there's
90.24,3.12,anything you don't understand here you
91.799,3.481,can then prompt it to explain that one
93.36,3.719,thing in more detail or explain that to
95.28,4.379,you like your five one problem though is
97.079,4.381,that llms tend to hallucinate AKA makes
99.659,3.42,stuff up so as of today it's not really
101.46,3.479,a replacement for the react.js
103.079,4.021,documentation which is excellent by the
104.939,3.901,way however chat EBT has a browser
107.1,3.18,plugin that's on a waitlist right now
108.84,3.419,which will eventually solve that
110.28,4.08,hallucination problem so the react.js
112.259,3.421,docs are like the Bible and chatgpt is
114.36,3.24,like a priest who makes all the money
115.68,3.42,but sometimes invents his own ideas now
117.6,2.879,once you have a general idea about the
119.1,2.94,language or framework that you're trying
120.479,3.6,to build with the next step is to set up
122.04,4.079,a project that allows you to inject AI
124.079,4.081,code in a safe and effective way there's
126.119,4.081,an old programming proverb that says if
128.16,3.299,code is not tested it doesn't work and
130.2,3.3,that's especially true when working with
131.459,4.5,an AI that acts like it's tripping bowls
133.5,4.08,I'm freaking out man as someone who's
135.959,3.121,done a lot of react development I'm just
137.58,3.06,going to do it the old-fashioned way and
139.08,3.299,set the project up the way I want it
140.64,4.2,manually but doing things like this is
142.379,4.08,very 2022. like yesterday on Twitter I
144.84,3.6,saw this guy set up and build a project
146.459,4.101,entirely from voice commands and then
148.44,6.06,deploy it to versel
150.56,6.88,which means it did in fact deploy dude
154.5,5.459,it did it it nailed the background no
157.44,4.56,way I'm using vs code for Microsoft as
159.959,4.621,my editor it's not available today but
162.0,4.98,GitHub copilot X is coming a plug-in for
164.58,3.78,vs code that brings chat EPT directly
166.98,2.88,into your editor make sure you're
168.36,3.06,subscribed for the latest updates on
169.86,4.62,that tool the only other tool you'll
171.42,5.34,need is chat EPT ideally with gpt4 which
174.48,4.08,is currently paid but 3.5 will work as
176.76,4.02,well here I have vs code open to my
178.56,3.72,terminal with node.js installed in the
180.78,4.02,future we'll have tools like GitHub
182.28,4.739,copilot CLI that can find and explain
184.8,3.96,commands for us but for now I'm just
187.019,3.661,going to initialize a new react project
188.76,3.18,with VJs we'll go ahead and use
190.68,2.699,typescript because I have some
191.94,2.879,typescript tricks to show you and then
193.379,2.94,once inside that project we'll go ahead
194.819,3.541,and install another tool called
196.319,3.84,playwright for end-to-end testing in the
198.36,3.36,browser When developing an app testing
200.159,3.3,is technically not required but it's
201.72,3.36,extremely important when working with AI
203.459,2.941,because we need to validate that it does
205.08,3.12,what it's supposed to the good news
206.4,3.419,though is that AI can write its own test
208.2,3.36,as we'll see shortly now the main
209.819,3.84,component in the source directory is in
211.56,4.38,the app.tsx file let's go ahead and
213.659,4.5,prompt chatgpt to replace it with a more
215.94,4.62,basic hello world gpt4 is kind of slow
218.159,4.08,and can often be overly verbose so one
220.56,3.599,thing you can do is just say code only
222.239,3.661,to shorten the response that looks
224.159,3.601,pretty good let's copy and paste it into
225.9,4.02,our project now go to the terminal and
227.76,3.96,run npm run Dev and you should get this
229.92,3.599,hello world component but that's a
231.72,3.78,little too simple let's go back to chat
233.519,3.78,EPT and now have it modify this code
235.5,3.84,with a button that will toggle the
237.299,3.421,visibility of the hello world text when
239.34,3.36,doing that it explains how we'll need to
240.72,3.599,use react state to manage the visibility
242.7,3.179,paste the updated code into your project
244.319,3.601,save it and now you have a working
245.879,3.481,interactive react app that's pretty cool
247.92,2.94,but we want to make sure that the AI
249.36,3.18,doesn't accidentally break this code in
250.86,3.599,the future so let's ask it to write a
252.54,4.259,test with playwright once again copy the
254.459,4.921,code then go into the test directory and
256.799,4.56,create a new file called app.test.ts
259.38,4.08,here's a pro tip as a printing engineer
261.359,4.201,you can use control V on your keyboard
263.46,3.9,instead of doing right click paste to
265.56,3.6,maximize your speed now from there we
267.36,3.779,need to go into the package Json file
269.16,3.599,and set up a testing script if you
271.139,3.0,already have copilot installed you can
272.759,2.88,just type test and it should
274.139,3.12,automatically detect playwright and
275.639,3.12,create the script for you which is just
277.259,3.72,playwright test from there we can open
278.759,3.601,the terminal run npm run test and
280.979,3.361,playwright will test this code on
282.36,3.6,multiple browsers in parallel as you can
284.34,3.419,see it fails because we don't have the
285.96,3.239,right localhost Port set up so let's go
287.759,3.601,ahead and modify that in our testing
289.199,4.321,code and run it again this time it
291.36,3.66,passes in the future GitHub copilot will
293.52,3.54,know the full context of your project
295.02,3.6,and won't make silly mistakes like these
297.06,3.06,this is cool and all but what you'll
298.62,3.54,find is your app grows more and more
300.12,3.78,complex it becomes harder and harder to
302.16,3.24,prompt the AI effectively it's
303.9,2.88,non-deterministic which means you can
305.4,3.299,get different results from the same
306.78,4.02,prompt you never know what you're going
308.699,3.481,to get and that's complete Madness for a
310.8,2.94,programmer but now here's where things
312.18,2.64,get really mind-blowing and will give
313.74,2.76,you a glimpse into the future of
314.82,3.48,programming at this point you have the
316.5,3.36,general idea of how react works but you
318.3,3.119,may not know JavaScript very well or
319.86,3.059,haven't memorized all the little quirks
321.419,2.881,in the framework or maybe you're a react
322.919,3.241,expert and just don't want to go through
324.3,3.6,the tedious process of writing perfectly
326.16,3.599,structured code so what we can do next
327.9,3.78,is have chat GPT come up with a
329.759,3.601,pseudocode language for react what this
331.68,3.299,will do is allow us to agree on some
333.36,3.48,general guidelines to represent the
334.979,3.481,structure of a react component as you
336.84,3.359,can see here it looks kind of like yaml
338.46,3.9,and allows us to Define State and then
340.199,3.421,the rendering function or jsx and if we
342.36,2.94,don't like the way it looks we can tell
343.62,3.24,it to come up with a different idea like
345.3,3.239,maybe make it look more like python
346.86,3.6,actually no let's make it look like a
348.539,3.781,cooking recipe which is surprisingly a
350.46,3.66,very intuitive way to represent a react
352.32,3.12,component and as an added benefit you
354.12,3.0,could write this in any human language
355.44,3.3,and have it translate your pseudocode
357.12,3.0,back to English but from a practical
358.74,3.0,standpoint I think you want something
360.12,3.12,that kind of looks like yaml overall
361.74,3.72,it's way more concise and doesn't
363.24,3.78,require us to use precise syntax but at
365.46,3.48,the same time it will give us relatively
367.02,3.48,consistent results and we can make it
368.94,3.96,even better by including relevant
370.5,3.9,documentation or a style guide to force
372.9,3.84,it to write code in a style that fits
374.4,4.92,our project because gpt4 can now handle
376.74,4.5,up to 25 000 tokens the end result is
379.32,3.719,your own custom AI pseudocode language
381.24,3.48,as you can see here I wrote out a
383.039,3.301,relatively complex component in this
384.72,3.72,language and it generates perfect react
386.34,4.02,code as a result but most importantly it
388.44,3.42,generates the same code every time most
390.36,3.059,of the time maybe eighty percent of the
391.86,3.3,time this is pretty mind-blowing because
393.419,3.72,now any developer can have their own
395.16,4.08,custom tailored pseudocode language that
397.139,3.301,can transpile into complex code in
399.24,3.6,virtually any language without
400.44,4.14,understanding the underlying syntax in a
402.84,3.54,previous video I predicted that someday
404.58,3.54,there will be a universal AI language
406.38,3.42,but maybe I was wrong maybe every
408.12,3.6,developer gets to build their own AI
409.8,3.78,language custom tailored to optimize
411.72,4.199,their own productivity sounds like chaos
413.58,4.26,on a team but AI can also translate your
415.919,3.84,pseudo code into my pseudocode and my
417.84,3.54,pseudocode into your pseudocode in fact
419.759,3.841,one thing we could do right now is take
421.38,4.379,the generated react code and convert it
423.6,3.24,into a superior framework like svelte or
425.759,2.761,solid there's a million different
426.84,3.72,JavaScript Frameworks out there but now
428.52,3.66,we can use them without learning them in
430.56,2.759,fact we could use our pseudocode to
432.18,2.88,build the same app in multiple
433.319,3.361,Frameworks at the same time then and
435.06,3.12,Benchmark their performance and just
436.68,3.359,choose whichever one performs the best
438.18,3.54,that's more of a futuristic idea but
440.039,3.121,currently the main value of pseudocode
441.72,3.36,is just getting things done faster
443.16,3.84,without allowing the AI to become too
445.08,3.78,magical like in this example you can see
447.0,3.419,we're making an API call but currently
448.86,3.899,we don't have any kind of interface for
450.419,3.9,the response generally speaking gpt4
452.759,2.88,will provide better results when you
454.319,3.421,have statically typed code like
455.639,3.78,typescript or even just type hints in a
457.74,3.6,language like python in this case I have
459.419,3.84,a Json object and what I'll do is paste
461.34,3.84,that into chat GPT to turn it into a
463.259,4.021,typescript interface it's able to detect
465.18,3.84,the two different entities of TV shows
467.28,3.72,and actors and now we can use it in our
469.02,3.66,code now that chatgpt has this interface
471.0,3.24,we can also tell it to generate any kind
472.68,3.48,of helper functions we'll need like if
474.24,3.72,we wanted to map this object to all the
476.16,3.479,actor names that's a pretty handy trick
477.96,4.019,right now but once again in the future
479.639,4.921,it won't be necessary tools like copilot
481.979,4.381,will be able to introspect any API to
484.56,3.6,provide you with automatic and type
486.36,3.3,safety without any effort on your part
488.16,3.659,now the final thing we need to do as a
489.66,3.18,print engineer is document our code we
491.819,3.6,simply take the code we've already
492.84,4.799,generated until chatgpt to document it
495.419,4.081,congratulations you're now a 10x react
497.639,4.62,proofed engineer the starting salary is
499.5,4.8,about 335k this productivity boost is
502.259,3.72,both exciting and scary Goldman Sachs
504.3,3.839,just released a report saying that 300
505.979,3.601,million jobs could be affected by AI in
508.139,3.24,the near future but there's no reason to
509.58,3.72,be afraid software systems in real life
511.379,3.421,are complex beyond belief and not even
513.3,3.419,state-of-the-artai will want to touch
514.8,3.78,that code I do believe that AI will make
516.719,3.301,writing code significantly easier but
518.58,3.06,building complex software that powers
520.02,3.54,the world will still be done by humans
521.64,3.24,in the foreseeable future and my goal
523.56,3.12,with this channel is to teach you how to
524.88,4.94,do exactly that thanks for watching and
526.68,3.14,I will see you in the next one
