okay let's
get into it um
web designing and programming
well the name itself might look
not that complicated you can just
imagine like web designing
is about putting pretty buttons on top
of pretty photos
and where programming would be like
positioning
those buttons and photos with html as
css
well yes basically it is but um
if you start learning about how to
design and
program a product for our case
a website that many people
should visit and enjoy using it
like the facebook or reddit um
learning but learning
uh the theoretical
theoretical parts of building websites
um in order to get attention from the
users
can get complicated
well it's a broad broad field of study
um i should say um it's a whole bigger
than
just choose a color
and import a photo with html
tag we should go through at least
some of the topics that other bigger
universities outside our country
study so here um
we will be talking about hci
first human computer interaction
first uh it is a study of
a relationship between you and your
website that is shown on a computer to
put it simply
um let me prepare my pen
i forgot
okay um
[Music]
well computers are becoming
more and more ubiquitous in our
our world of life computers are
everywhere well
well that's why we are in computer
science department right
um learning about about computers
so what is computer guys
can someone answer that well let's see
the short description of a computer
it is a electronic device for storing
and processing data
in the short um well okay so
is uh so is computer the desktop
computer
in front of you yes it is
but also the monitor you're watching
this video
is a computer phone in your pocket is
also a computer watch on your wrist
card dashboard system
that shows the mileage or some
electronic toys
some refrigerators you could see in the
movies which
checks the content inside and suggests
us the shopping list
well in this rapidly growing
and developing technology era
computers are almost part of everything
so again this is the reason we
need to study and learn about human
computer
interaction hci designing
and make some great life-changing or
maybe
world-changing project design well for
our case
a website website is the product
cool way the facebook website
changed many people's life you know
me let's see
the description of hci that i found from
the internet
and well i find it very accurate
um
okay human computer interaction
hci is a multidisciplinary field of
study
focusing on the design of computer
technology
and particularly the interaction between
humans and the computers
so it is a study of not only the
visual designing and programming the
project you might imagine
but it is about studying and
understanding
humans and their mind
psychology how people how users might
work
how people interact interact with a
certain computerized
product interface like website
so it's about again it's about how you
interact with your smartphones and
application on it
it is a very broad area of study um
phew are you excited
okay um
um let's take a close look at
humans from human computer interaction
design
the first word um this human
okay uh we humans um
we here um we humans perceive the world
around us
through our five senses as we know
seeing on hearing
and um feeling not
this feeling too and this feeling but
um tasting and smelling
are actually excluded in this very study
unless you guys develop a
website uh for example a cooking website
that
senses taste and smell though
anyways uh also we have memories
or experience skill
and knowledge and wisdom
so why are we talking about these well
again when we design a product
a website we must take into
consideration
every element of the human
from way they perceive and interact
with the computer
um okay because websites
are for humans humans use it
not cats or hamsters no offense to the
cats and hamsters
okay as we have mentioned earlier that
computers are everywhere
tablets smartphones smartwatch cameras
thermostat car dashboard plain dashboard
gamepad
electronic toys fridges video um
vr games etc
um you know from the gamepad here um
you might have understood that computer
interface just doesn't necessarily have
to be with
a touchable or watchable screen
it can be all types of shapes with all
types of buttons
those can be interacted with that's an
interface
also there are more advanced
and more future fields of hci
which are virtual reality beings for
medical field
or architecture designing and of course
gaming
and um here dexter haptic gloves
here which were invented to mimic touch
sensations of hardness softness
aspringiness and more when using virtual
reality um also pre-touch sensing phones
here
that read your minds
well no they don't read our minds well
the pre-touched phones
should be able to understand how the
user is holding it or what fingers
are approaching the screen
to predict what the user wants to do
so it's a prediction game a bit similar
with iron man interacting with his
computer
any marvel fans this would give
the sense that your phone can read your
mind as it performs
actions before you even give you give
your phone
a clear command
and finally a paper id is about
digitalizing paper
right yes making the paper into a
touchscreen
this new technology supposedly
will give paper the ability to sense
its surroundings and respond to gesture
commands
as well as connect to the internet of
things okay
cool
okay the third word
from human computer interaction design
interaction is a kind of
action that occurs as two or more
objects have an effect upon one another
okay you push a button on a screen
computer will show us a new window
as a response and go back and forth
that's the interaction
action between you and the computer is
an interaction
in one sentence you can um summarize
but even though you are interacting with
the computer interface or graphical user
interface
you are actually doing a task
okay that you want to do
um to do through the interface
here you actually want to send an email
or buy issues or shoot zombies
etc you shouldn't forget
that users i mean p we
people use computer to do a task
through the graphical interface what i
mean
what i mean is hci doesn't
end with these two human
and computer but should always consider
this the task
so the designer or developer's goal
our goal is to help humans
feel like they're interacting directly
with the task
while the interface um kind of
vanishes in the middle of that
interaction like this
which literally means we should let
the users spend as much time as possible
thinking about the task instead of
thinking about the interface
like for example like uh people should
be thinking about
what to write to sarah
the friend but um not like people
uh should be thinking about should i
mean people should not be thinking about
like where is the inbox folder where is
the new email button or
what this button is for
okay now the last
the last word from human computer
interaction design
this is the word i love the most
design let's see some descriptions that
i find
them accurate design
is the process of imagining and planning
the creation of objects systems
buildings vehicles etc
it is about creating solutions for
people okay design
is the creation of the products
and the services that people use design
makes technology usable for people
design connects people with technology
you get it okay and good design
is really about solving problems
well the last sentence is the sentence
you must
repeat to yourselves every time
every moment you design something
your design should solve problems
more the better uh that what designers
do
they solve problems okay
um then what is a
good design as i said
design should solve problems that's the
main thing
a good design is effective and efficient
in fulfilling its purpose purpose of
solving a problem it relies on
as few external factors and inputs
as possible simple the better and
these are easy to measure and manipulate
to achieve an expected other output
a good design is always the simplest
possible working solution
okay um
every project is a problem or challenge
that involves helping other people
understand
something okay
can you see how the water
water drum help helped the woman
and young children into south africa
this photo the design of
this water drum changed their lives
helping them designers saw the struggle
of
women and children bringing heavy heavy
water to their homes
do the designers solve the problem with
this simple but very effective and
useful drum
that holds lots of water and doesn't
need to be lifted from the ground
not heavy and can travel long distances
you can just push it
okay what about the next one it says
there is no planet b like the plan b
well this single poster has one short
sentence
with one image simple as possible but
you do understand the message it's
trying to convey right
save the earth okay from this you can
understand
that good design should be meaningful it
sends
message in the simplest way and the most
effective way possible
well because well people are lazy they
don't want to read lots of texts
okay for the third design wayfinding
signs that you can see at airports
without easy to understand signs
how can you find the toilet or the
boarding gate when there is no one to
ask
on old and young people
all around the world that uses all
different languages
should be able able to understand the
toilet size shouldn't they
this design solve the problem
okay when it comes to designing and
developing a product
whether it's a water drum or website or
a poster
you have got to understand what design
thinking is
well same again it's about solving
problems in the most
creative and innovative way
well first you have to emphasize
people's problem
like the water drum problem
then uh um i mean
not then i'm emphasizing um you have to
understand
how and why people are struggling with
what
that's the emphasizing step first step
and then and then define the problem
um like um
you should just think like okay this is
the problem i found the problem
that's the defining and then you get
some ideas and sketch
of the solution solution product
like the water drum sketches and then
make the prototype of them
try try to make the um
a prototype means the similar
working product to the final product
similar to the final product and then
test them to see
how it works and it's not working
you have to fix the box that's the
testing step
okay the most important part of this
cycle
is actually emphasizing the first step
the starting point understanding people
which means you have got to understand
people's emotions
needs motivations and drives of
behavior you don't just start coding
and stuff okay um
po po paul bo um the co-founder of
headscape limited
it's a it's a design company
um to be a great designer you
need to look a little deeper into how
people think and
act okay
and uh team team brown
is not here um team brown ido is
president
and ceo defines design thinking
uh like this uh listen the mission of
design thinking
is to ease the mission of design
thinking
is to translate observation
into insights and insights
into products and services that
will improve lives
okay from this you can think
okay my website should solve
a problem and
improve lives
okay did you think that okay
okay to say it again
all designing process goes through these
simple steps first emphasize
empathize next define the
problem get some ideas
make a prototype of the solution and
taste
uh not taste uh test it
um see here um emphasizing
helps to define the problem
and prototyping will
help you to find more um
more help you to learn from the
prototypes to spark new ideas
testing will um testing
will will help you to find the problems
with previous ideas and redefine the
problem again
so it's going on and on it's a
full cycle and we are going
to apply this process
this full process to our project
because it's a design project
okay today's homework
is read on design thinking
read about design thinking google it
from the internet of things and
summarize in only three sentence
three sentences well the sentences
can be long and upload
to the google classroom if you
three sentences are impressive enough
you will get
the additional bonus point also i have
if you have noticed i included two
yellow boxes
with keywords throughout the
presentation
those are additional bonus point
questions google that
if you study and summarize in three
sentences each
of that of those
keywords you will get the bonus points
too
well lots of bonuses will be given
if you put your heart to it so let your
brains
storm but hey
hey no pleasurism no copy and paste
from the cool internet well
me um i can copy and paste your
sentences
and know where you got them okay well
that it
that is it for today actually
let's discuss more online
okay bye
