1.62,3.0,foreign
7.639,4.781,visualization in data science
10.559,3.901,my thanks for talk was that hosts for
12.42,3.66,making the stock possible I trust a
14.46,4.7,couple of words about me as it was
16.08,5.64,already set I am book Grand Master
19.16,4.48,in in hold the first place in the
21.72,4.26,ranking for some time so I have some
23.64,3.899,experience in data visualization and
25.98,3.6,currently I am working at the senior
27.539,4.56,data scientist at Karim and use that
29.58,5.04,resultation at my job too so I have some
32.099,4.8,practical experience in Industry too
34.62,3.0,uh let me present you the content of my
36.899,2.881,talk
37.62,4.56,first of all I'll speak about better
39.78,4.92,reservation in general why is it useful
42.18,5.34,how can it be used for everyday tasks
44.7,5.1,and what is it then I'll speak a bit
47.52,5.219,about the history the history of data
49.8,6.02,visualization is a huge topic so I'll
52.739,5.64,just highlight several important points
55.82,4.66,nowadays people usually use specialized
58.379,4.261,software for data visualization and I'll
60.48,5.22,show examples and when possible the
62.64,4.92,pieces of code for it uh there are a lot
65.7,4.62,of types of charts which people use for
67.56,5.46,data visualization so they have various
70.32,4.619,ways of being categorized and I'll show
73.02,3.48,these ways
74.939,3.961,um next if you are doing that
76.5,4.56,visualization like for yourself or
78.9,4.859,infrequently then you could use just
81.06,5.04,default ways of doing it but you aim to
83.759,6.021,do it professionally you would need more
86.1,6.24,skills and I will talk about the skills
89.78,4.6,is that previous points were more about
92.34,3.3,the theory even though with some pieces
94.38,4.08,of code and next I'll talk about
95.64,4.979,practice I'll show several examples of
98.46,4.26,taking a mediocre visualization and
100.619,4.86,improving it we will see how can they be
102.72,4.32,improved step by step and then I will
105.479,3.78,show some practical examples of
107.04,3.539,visualizations used for machine learning
109.259,3.621,specifically for models for
110.579,5.761,interpretation and so on
112.88,5.62,so what is that visualization if we use
116.34,3.84,a formal definition then data
118.5,3.84,visualization is the graphical
120.18,6.18,representation of information and data
122.34,6.54,Yeah so basically we are humans our life
126.36,5.099,our eyes are drawn to colors to shapes
128.88,5.34,and patterns so data visualization uses
131.459,4.621,them and regrets our interest and tries
134.22,5.34,to keep us interested in the message
136.08,5.58,when we see a chart we usually can see
139.56,4.16,the trends and developers if we see
141.66,4.62,something we can easily easily
143.72,4.78,internalize and understand it and this
146.28,4.02,is how storytelling works this is much
148.5,3.42,better than just studying at a huge
150.3,4.68,spreadsheet with data and then selling
151.92,5.1,nothing but it's not that easy you can't
154.98,3.72,just slap a random chart on the data
157.02,4.079,yeah to create an efficient that
158.7,5.22,visualization we need to balance the
161.099,4.92,form and the function for example if we
163.92,3.84,have a practical bad playing graph it
166.019,3.961,could be too boring to capture people's
167.76,5.339,attention yeah on the other hand if you
169.98,4.8,have Estonian visualization it may have
173.099,4.261,may fail at delivering the right message
174.78,4.739,information yes so the data and the
177.36,3.72,visualization need to work together and
179.519,4.621,there is not to combine in great
181.08,4.92,analysis with great storytelling now I
184.14,3.84,will show two practical examples where
186.0,4.7,data visualization shines compared to
187.98,5.339,these looking at simple back statistics
190.7,5.14,this small data set is called as
193.319,5.34,compressed that it worked it shows four
195.84,4.619,pairs of X and Y they have different
198.659,3.541,values and yet they have the same
200.459,4.5,statistics and correlation as you can
202.2,7.259,see in all the cases the mean value of x
204.959,6.541,is nine the mean value of y is 7 7.5
209.459,5.101,when the correlation is the same yeah
211.5,5.34,but if we look at the plots we see a
214.56,4.2,completely different story yeah the
216.84,4.5,first Port is something which we could
218.76,5.58,expect of a Europe situation when I have
221.34,5.1,some data or some random noise and but
224.34,3.78,it's still currently yeah but if you
226.44,3.06,look at the second and the third charts
228.12,3.66,you can see that they are very different
229.5,4.379,from the first one and of course there
231.78,5.519,is the last plot which has a huge
233.879,6.061,outlier and uh yes so so you can see
237.299,4.981,that we have the similar data they have
239.94,4.74,similar statistics but they look
242.28,4.2,completely different of course when we
244.68,4.38,have this small table we can see the
246.48,5.1,problem almost immediately here but if
249.06,4.02,we have some huge data some big data
251.58,3.48,with million Scrolls it would be
253.08,4.14,impossible to just understand something
255.06,4.859,by looking at it so visualization would
257.22,5.22,really help in this case yeah another
259.919,4.981,fun example if this is the set it's
262.44,5.16,called the resource doesn't yeah as you
264.9,5.88,could guess from its name it has 12 data
267.6,6.72,sets with the same stats so basically we
270.78,5.52,have a 12 uh different data sets which
274.32,3.9,have the same means the same statistics
276.3,4.08,but as you can see they look completely
278.22,3.84,different yeah so this is another great
280.38,4.08,example of the importance of data
282.06,4.32,visualization
284.46,4.38,um as I said history about the
286.38,4.62,visualization is a huge and vast topic
288.84,4.68,yeah but it's not possible to speak
291.0,4.919,about everything in my talk so if you
293.52,4.92,want to know more about
295.919,5.301,some important Milestones then you could
298.44,6.479,read this slide yeah but I'll talk about
301.22,6.28,two points first of all I want to show
304.919,5.101,this awesome visualization yeah this
307.5,5.52,visualization was done around two
310.02,5.52,centuries ago and it's called the minor
313.02,7.02,minor diagram it shows the losses
315.54,7.499,suffered by Napoleon's Army in the 1812.
320.04,5.999,here you can see six variables the size
323.039,6.121,of the army the location in the
326.039,4.321,two-dimensional surface this time the
329.16,3.66,direction of movement and the
330.36,4.44,temperature Yeah so basically when you
332.82,4.02,look at the line the width illustrates
334.8,5.82,the size of the army at a specific point
336.84,5.22,of time the temperature axis shows the
340.62,3.9,possible cause of the change of
342.06,5.94,environment size yeah and you can also
344.52,5.58,see where the Army was situated Yeah so
348.0,4.639,basically you have six variables on the
350.1,5.939,two-dimensional surface
352.639,5.081,wrote in 1900 take a series that it
356.039,4.021,could be the best statistical graph ever
357.72,4.74,drawn of course since the time there
360.06,4.32,were some other awesome graphs but this
362.46,3.54,is still amazing for the time that
364.38,5.24,Bishop was created
366.0,7.08,uh speaking of two uh John 2K and Denver
369.62,5.16,are two famous uh persons because they
373.08,4.74,did a lot of progress data visualization
374.78,5.08,one of them had a statistical approach
377.82,3.42,for exploratory data analysis and the
379.86,2.959,other one wrote the book the visual
381.24,4.2,displays of quantitative information
382.819,4.421,they paved the way for refining data
385.44,3.84,visualization techniques so that can be
387.24,5.04,used by simple people and not only by
389.28,5.46,statisticians yeah in this book that
392.28,5.039,also defines the principles for a fixed
394.74,4.679,effective graphical display and they are
397.319,4.741,still actually in use nowadays yeah
399.419,4.321,there are a lot of great ideas but they
402.06,4.5,can be received in the following points
403.74,5.399,the first one is maximize data in
406.56,4.859,Croatia the think ratio is the term of
409.139,5.041,the also and he uses it a lot in his
411.419,4.62,book yeah basically he was against using
414.18,3.959,excessive decorations he performed
416.039,5.1,simple and functional charts yeah
418.139,5.101,another point is minimize life Factor so
421.139,3.961,avoid distorting what the data has to
423.24,4.2,say I will show several examples of it
425.1,5.76,and there's the points I think are
427.44,7.14,self-explanary so it's understandable
430.86,5.64,now I want to talk about the software if
434.58,3.72,we talk about some beautiful data
436.5,4.08,visualizations they're usually done by
438.3,4.86,hand or maybe by usual visual editors
440.58,4.32,even Photoshop for example but usually
443.16,3.539,it's too time consuming pretty
444.9,3.78,inefficient and people prefer to use
446.699,4.141,more practical software
448.68,3.84,let's start with python yeah python is
450.84,3.359,commonly used to programming language
452.52,3.84,used for machine learning data science
454.199,4.5,and many other things there are a lot of
456.36,4.739,packages and MacBook leap is the most
458.699,4.44,popular one for data visualization it's
461.099,4.081,possible to do almost anything with it
463.139,4.5,yeah also it would require a lot of code
465.18,4.98,those people who already tried math
467.639,4.201,complete know that it's very verbose
470.16,3.72,sometimes you need to write a real
471.84,5.46,result of code yeah but it's extremely
473.88,5.46,flexible and versatile yeah once in it
477.3,4.739,isn't very good at is making interactive
479.34,4.139,clothes because the world's well it's
482.039,3.121,possible to create them yeah it's
483.479,4.5,possible but it will be very difficult
485.16,5.28,and there are better tools for example
487.979,4.981,this tool this is plotly this is another
490.44,4.74,python library and it is what's created
492.96,4.739,for interactive visualizations making
495.18,4.98,pop-ups filtering zooming and many other
497.699,4.62,things there is a huge ecosystem around
500.16,4.8,it for example there is a dash for
502.319,4.5,creating the dashboards yeah of course
504.96,4.26,there are many different libraries for
506.819,4.081,interactive visualizations but for
509.22,4.319,example I like this one
510.9,4.68,and some of my visualizations will have
513.539,4.5,a code illustrating them so here you can
515.58,5.28,see how to make a singular similar
518.039,6.12,visualization basically you import the
520.86,5.88,plotly you get some data as a point of
524.159,5.341,the frame and you make a plot you define
526.74,6.0,what data you use so what will be the
529.5,5.22,high values what do the flow values and
532.74,3.84,so on and then you make a plot so it's
534.72,3.5,quite consistent yeah and not very
536.58,4.5,difficult
538.22,5.64,uh another Library which can be used
541.08,2.78,both foreign
544.64,5.319,I think it deserves a separate mention
547.2,5.52,well it may be not very popular not as
549.959,4.801,popular as possible but it's still very
552.72,3.72,awesome yeah it's one of the few
554.76,4.32,libraries that are based on the grammar
556.44,4.68,Graphics grammar of Graphics is like a
559.08,5.58,huge separate topic I can't discuss it
561.12,5.339,now too but basically it's a framework
564.66,3.66,which follows a layered approach to
566.459,4.5,describing and construct visualizations
568.32,5.16,of graphic and structured many when you
570.959,4.981,define different parts of the plot in
573.48,5.94,different ways so here is an example
575.94,5.24,yeah it's very different from plotly but
579.42,5.16,basically you also import this Library
581.18,6.04,you have the data and you pass it to the
584.58,4.68,code and then you define what you want
587.22,3.9,to show you want to show Colors you want
589.26,4.32,to show tool tips and you can Define
591.12,4.8,that it will be interactive or not yeah
593.58,5.04,so it I think it's about it's
595.92,5.82,interesting properly yeah and very
598.62,4.92,likely to use it now if we talk about
601.74,4.44,visualizations and the programming
603.54,4.5,languages we have to speak about r r is
606.18,4.32,a widely used programming language for
608.04,4.739,data science and machine learning and
610.5,4.44,the digi plot 2 is the most famous
612.779,4.321,library for visualization many people
614.94,4.74,say it's the best that we can use for
617.1,5.64,visualizations even if we compare iron
619.68,4.92,python yeah so and you can notice that
622.74,3.719,this button the previous ones are pretty
624.6,4.14,similar yeah yeah and this is because
626.459,4.201,digital plot 2 is also based on the gram
628.74,4.2,of graphics and you can see that the
630.66,4.44,syntax is even simpler yeah and many
632.94,4.38,people prefer the syntax they say is
635.1,4.26,that JoJo Port 2 is awesome and very
637.32,4.26,easy to use and they can't use anything
639.36,4.08,else well difficult to argue with them
641.58,3.379,considering that we need someone to code
643.44,4.56,for it right
644.959,4.781,uh now while a lot of people use
648.0,3.6,programming languages for visualization
649.74,4.26,yeah there are many solutions to for
651.6,4.2,making visualizations without them for
654.0,3.899,example Tableau is one of the most
655.8,4.2,famous tools for creating visualizations
657.899,3.961,and dashboards yeah it can be you
660.0,4.2,published a white audience it can be
661.86,5.219,self-hosted and so on and so on it's
664.2,4.98,very flexible it allows a lot of things
667.079,3.481,to do and it's quite popular so if you
669.18,4.44,don't want to use programming language
670.56,5.339,yeah you can use this for example
673.62,5.459,but there is another side of the
675.899,4.801,spectrum so while Python and R have some
679.079,3.421,Syntax for right for making
680.7,4.139,visualizations that would be difficult
682.5,5.339,it would be simple but there is that
684.839,4.68,redress it's a library for JavaScript it
687.839,4.201,produces Dynamic and interactive
689.519,4.141,visualizations many stunning
692.04,4.08,visualizations on the internet are done
693.66,4.08,create with Nick but it's like extremely
696.12,4.2,difficult to use it requires a lot of
697.74,4.86,code it's very difficult so yeah you can
700.32,3.72,you should use it only if you are ensure
702.6,4.2,that you want to invest a lot of time
704.04,4.32,when making that organizations but yes
706.8,3.599,you will be able to create awesome
708.36,4.18,things which you won't be able to do any
710.399,3.321,other way yeah
712.54,3.979,[Music]
713.72,5.2,now let's talk about different types of
716.519,5.041,charts yeah there are really a lot of
718.92,5.52,them there are box plots error charts
721.56,5.279,and so on I don't think it's possible to
724.44,4.92,talk about each and one and every of
726.839,5.521,them in details yeah I'll speak about
729.36,5.94,them in a different way so if we have so
732.36,5.28,many different types of we need to have
735.3,4.56,some way to structure them to categorize
737.64,4.139,them to understand which one should we
739.86,4.38,use because if we know that there are
741.779,4.861,like 50 different types of graphs then
744.24,5.279,we maybe we won't have any idea which
746.64,5.52,one to use in our case so there are many
749.519,5.88,different ways to categorize them so
752.16,5.7,here for example this nice visualization
755.399,4.321,shows different types of plots which can
757.86,4.8,be used for different types of data so
759.72,5.88,basically this is categorization based
762.66,6.239,on the nation of data for example if you
765.6,5.46,have a single numerical feature yeah you
768.899,4.921,can use some density photo histogram
771.06,6.12,it's a basic approach and it's pretty
773.82,4.94,useful now if you use two of them you
777.18,4.8,need to show some kind of interaction
778.76,4.6,and the Scatter Plots or box plots are
781.98,4.2,great ways of doing
783.36,4.979,when you have more than then it could be
786.18,4.92,something difficult and you will have to
788.339,4.861,use some Advanced types of codes stack
791.1,4.44,the reports and so on but in practice
793.2,4.379,they are rarely used so usually you just
795.54,3.06,take one or two features and compare
797.579,3.481,them
798.6,4.919,now if you have categorical variables
801.06,4.62,then there are different approaches I
803.519,4.741,suppose bar plot is the most popular one
805.68,5.099,you just make blocks which shows for
808.26,4.62,example the account or the variable or
810.779,4.68,some statistics of it yeah it's pretty
812.88,6.24,popular it's pretty easy to use and it's
815.459,5.701,extremely good and versatile now if you
819.12,4.019,have more than there are some other
821.16,4.739,types of visualizations and you can see
823.139,6.061,them on the screen but I think that most
825.899,5.161,of them are rarely used like well maybe
829.2,5.1,if we don't speak about Trend diagram
831.06,4.2,but things like shorts are currently
834.3,3.74,unique
835.26,5.22,but also you could have some like
838.04,6.16,non-tabulary data yeah for example
840.48,6.06,networks well it's possible to make to
844.2,6.3,keep the network data in structured and
846.54,6.12,table that are uh interview but they
850.5,3.959,usually it's kept some different way and
852.66,3.179,here you can see for example networks
854.459,3.06,are doing the grounds that can be used
855.839,4.201,to plot
857.519,5.76,now it was about the nature of the data
860.04,5.58,but now let's see if what sharp should
863.279,4.381,be used based on what we want to show so
865.62,4.14,basically if you want to show some
867.66,5.82,distribution if you want to show the
869.76,5.579,variable it's maximum minimum value how
873.48,4.5,it behaves over time then you will use
875.339,4.44,violence histograms Rich spots and so on
877.98,3.719,if you want to show the correlation
879.779,3.961,between two more variables you will use
881.699,4.681,catapults for example and so on and so
883.74,5.82,on so there are many ways of showing
886.38,7.44,different things which you want to show
889.56,6.48,and that was more about like uh what you
893.82,4.74,want to show that was more about like
896.04,4.739,just taking reservation and making yeah
898.56,4.2,but if you want to make a profession of
900.779,4.981,it if you want to work in that
902.76,5.759,visualization as a specialist and use it
905.76,5.34,yeah then you would need some much much
908.519,4.861,more skills yeah I want to go into
911.1,5.16,someone details but I'll describe them
913.38,5.759,at least a week so for example that
916.26,4.5,realization is self-explanatory yeah but
919.139,4.021,for example if you want to make a
920.76,4.5,dashboard or some other complex
923.16,5.76,visualization you would need to know
925.26,5.34,experience interface design ux and many
928.92,3.599,other things because you need to
930.6,4.14,understand how to present data so people
932.519,3.781,are interested for example there are a
934.74,3.659,lot of dashboards which no one uses
936.3,4.2,because they have too many plots or the
938.399,4.321,ports are not understandable yeah it's
940.5,4.98,important to do it next point is
942.72,4.619,storytelling because one thing is when
945.48,3.9,you have some visualization you send it
947.339,3.841,to someone and that's it another point
949.38,3.899,is when you're making some presentation
951.18,4.2,so for example you're showing the
953.279,3.721,audience some thoughts and that is
955.38,3.66,describes them in this case it's
957.0,3.959,important to have storytelling when you
959.04,4.22,capture the audience you tell the story
960.959,4.44,and prove the points which you're making
963.26,4.72,there are many other things like
965.399,4.321,selecting good colors uh making the
967.98,4.2,books accessible for different groups of
969.72,4.859,people and so on and so on and one
972.18,5.88,separate and very important thing is
974.579,5.581,style guides so basically style guides
978.06,5.7,are some standards for formatting and
980.16,5.76,designing the graphs so basically they
983.76,3.9,show what graphs should be used in
985.92,3.24,specific cases what colors should be
987.66,3.6,used what formation should be used and
989.16,3.84,so on and so on usually there are some
991.26,3.48,templates to make it easy for people to
993.0,4.68,apply the science of the guide
994.74,5.219,usually these tailgates are created to
997.68,4.62,buy some organization to show that
999.959,4.861,people work in this organization who
1002.3,4.74,made a similar plot yeah so for example
1004.82,4.259,they could think have things like logo
1007.04,5.159,brand colors language stones and so on
1009.079,5.101,and so on so it makes uh it easier for
1012.199,3.781,different people to make great
1014.18,4.26,visualizations without spending too much
1015.98,4.74,time on designing it and it provides
1018.44,5.94,some uniformity yeah
1020.72,6.479,so right now I talked a lot about the
1024.38,3.78,theory but now let's move a bit into
1027.199,4.98,practice
1028.16,6.179,so for example if we have some kind of
1032.179,4.62,not good visualization what are the
1034.339,4.5,general ways of improving it first of
1036.799,4.5,all we'll fix errors because there are
1038.839,4.021,some mistakes in visualizations and this
1041.299,4.38,is precisely what I will talk about a
1042.86,5.52,bit later next to make it look better
1045.679,6.601,because sometimes people choose bad
1048.38,5.88,colors sometimes people don't don't show
1052.28,4.56,the nested information
1054.26,4.74,another point is crypto audience for
1056.84,4.26,example if you show presentation for
1059.0,4.32,technical people you would show the
1061.1,5.22,information detailed analysis detailed
1063.32,5.099,numbers but if you show the presentation
1066.32,4.26,to some high-level audience to business
1068.419,3.901,people you don't need all the details
1070.58,4.02,you need to show the trends some general
1072.32,4.62,high-level information yeah
1074.6,4.92,so right now we will show several
1076.94,4.859,examples of taking mediocre pots in the
1079.52,3.96,province them most of them are from a
1081.799,5.161,wonderful book storytelling with dated
1083.48,6.54,by by called nothing
1086.96,4.86,so let's take the first one let's try to
1090.02,5.64,understand what do we see on the screen
1091.82,7.26,so we have some survey yeah it seems
1095.66,5.759,that people asked how do they feel about
1099.08,5.76,doing science and there are some groups
1101.419,5.221,of people yeah but I'm not sure what
1104.84,3.12,exactly they also was supposed to show
1106.64,4.32,in this visualization
1107.96,5.94,so let's see how can this be improved
1110.96,5.219,this is the same data but presented in a
1113.9,4.74,different way so what is what is the
1116.179,5.521,difference first of all we have a
1118.64,5.22,different title and it shows us like
1121.7,4.74,everything we have the title pilot
1123.86,4.86,program was a success so we know that
1126.44,3.9,this is about pilot programming we know
1128.72,3.78,that it was successful and it was
1130.34,5.64,complete yeah so it's much better much
1132.5,5.34,more understandable next we have a few
1135.98,4.02,recovers because when we have too many
1137.84,4.44,colors it's difficult to concentrate
1140.0,6.299,yeah here we have only several colors
1142.28,6.48,yeah we have only important info and
1146.299,5.461,it's more structure so basically let's
1148.76,4.86,see on the both spots again here we will
1151.76,4.5,see two pie charts and it's difficult to
1153.62,5.4,compare the categories which were worse
1156.26,4.919,which were good yeah and we don't really
1159.02,5.58,understand what was the message but here
1161.179,7.081,we can see that at first the people were
1164.6,5.4,like okay before the program and now we
1168.26,2.82,can see that most people are excited to
1170.0,3.44,kind of Interest
1171.08,5.28,so it's like this visualization it
1173.44,4.66,accentuates the information it doesn't
1176.36,3.48,distract you and it shows the main
1178.1,3.06,message right now this is why it's
1179.84,5.339,better
1181.16,6.96,next one is this so basically it's the
1185.179,5.281,quote about uh it demonstrates
1188.12,3.66,Effectiveness that's the most important
1190.46,4.44,consideration When selecting the
1191.78,4.98,provider yeah but basically we like have
1194.9,3.54,a lot of text on the screen it's
1196.76,4.799,difficult to understand what we should
1198.44,5.099,look at at first we have a lot of bars
1201.559,4.98,and we are not sure what which of them
1203.539,4.38,are more important yeah so what can be
1206.539,4.321,done by time
1207.919,4.921,you can see right now that the most
1210.86,4.98,important information is highlighted in
1212.84,5.82,the text so we now see that the code is
1215.84,5.52,about attributes yeah this the survey
1218.66,4.8,shows some results and which results are
1221.36,4.559,the most important yeah this is the
1223.46,5.52,source and we see three most important
1225.919,5.161,parts so basically here we attract with
1228.98,4.439,properly on purpose and track the
1231.08,4.02,attention of the readers to the parts of
1233.419,4.321,the port which are important yeah so
1235.1,5.459,it's really good idea to do it
1237.74,4.74,another case we have this plot Yeah so
1240.559,4.74,basically it's some kind of line chart
1242.48,4.74,of the time we see that something was
1245.299,3.681,received something was processed and
1247.22,3.9,that's it there is no other information
1248.98,4.78,so obviously we need some other
1251.12,6.179,information so what could we do
1253.76,5.46,now we can see the clear message that we
1257.299,5.821,have some action item please approve the
1259.22,6.24,value to people we show that the number
1263.12,4.32,of process and the received tickets were
1265.46,4.38,almost the same so all the problems were
1267.44,4.68,processed but after some event happened
1269.84,4.5,two people left we see that the real
1272.12,4.86,discrepancy so basically this chart
1274.34,4.8,shows that there was a problem it shows
1276.98,4.14,the consequences of this problem and it
1279.14,4.08,shows how can the problem be solved so
1281.12,4.5,it's like a perfect thing which is a
1283.22,4.26,call to action we know what happened we
1285.62,4.2,know what should we do yeah so it's like
1287.48,6.66,an amazing thing I think
1289.82,7.739,and the last example we can see that
1294.14,7.08,here we see two bars we show the
1297.559,6.181,population of U.S and the customers of
1301.22,5.76,some company and we have some segments
1303.74,7.14,with uh some of them highlighted yeah
1306.98,6.059,but for me this is like uh not very
1310.88,5.4,looking good looking how can this be
1313.039,6.061,improved yeah first of all this text
1316.28,6.06,they are aligned in the same way because
1319.1,5.34,we don't have this like credit team with
1322.34,4.38,different climate next we have less
1324.44,5.4,colors and the most important parts are
1326.72,4.62,highlighted so now we see or what is
1329.84,5.839,what are the differences between them
1331.34,4.339,yeah and it's much more aesthetically
1335.78,5.639,okay this was about improving some
1338.299,6.36,mediocre plots now let's talk about some
1341.419,6.681,things which you shouldn't do at all on
1344.659,6.541,the screen you can see a cargo notebook
1348.1,5.38,this is just me scrolling it as you can
1351.2,4.979,see it shows the distribution of some
1353.48,5.939,feature and that's it so we have we see
1356.179,5.521,like thousands or hundreds of plots they
1359.419,4.201,are almost the same they don't have any
1361.7,4.62,titles they don't have any comments they
1363.62,5.58,don't have any analysis so it's like
1366.32,5.52,it's very it isn't really useful so if
1369.2,4.74,you want to do something useful okay so
1371.84,4.56,in this case I would say that there are
1373.94,4.92,two approaches to the generalized data
1376.4,3.84,first one is for your own analysis and
1378.86,3.42,the second is for demonstrating your
1380.24,4.98,results when you're doing your own
1382.28,4.98,analysis it could be okay to make dozens
1385.22,4.98,of thoughts yeah but even in this case
1387.26,5.34,you should like make titles make
1390.2,4.979,descriptions for this box so that you
1392.6,4.14,could say understand them yourself on
1395.179,2.701,the other hand when you're presenting
1396.74,3.54,something within your Publishers
1397.88,5.58,notebook it is much better to have
1400.28,4.8,several plots which are made with scare
1403.46,4.68,which have explanations with share
1405.08,5.94,analysis and some comments yeah so this
1408.14,5.039,is uh this is what you should do instead
1411.02,4.98,of this visualization
1413.179,5.341,next point is that using the
1416.0,5.34,three-dimensional plots is often not
1418.52,5.1,very useful because it's like it's very
1421.34,5.04,difficult to compare the things so for
1423.62,4.32,example if we look at this plot if we
1426.38,4.02,look at the column view but it's this
1427.94,4.44,value can you guess it just by looking I
1430.4,4.44,would say it's for example 14 but if we
1432.38,4.14,pronounce lines it's certified so it's
1434.84,3.36,like this visualization can be
1436.52,5.519,misleading it could be difficult to
1438.2,6.54,compare the things so try to avoid it
1442.039,5.461,and the one more thing is like pie chart
1444.74,5.1,pie charts in general are very like hot
1447.5,4.799,debated topics some people say that no
1449.84,5.1,one should use them some people say that
1452.299,5.161,you should take care when using them but
1454.94,4.26,anyway in this case when we have a
1457.46,3.06,three-dimensional pie chart it's
1459.2,3.839,extremely difficult to compare the
1460.52,5.639,things like for example is B bigger than
1463.039,6.421,C I have no idea from this chart so like
1466.159,5.041,this could be useful like when the
1469.46,4.02,different categories have clearly
1471.2,4.44,different percentages yeah but when we
1473.48,3.78,want to compare them then it's like not
1475.64,3.6,very useful
1477.26,3.899,and this is like a pretty different
1479.24,3.72,topic
1481.159,4.861,if you look at this plot you could think
1482.96,5.099,that the difference was like extremely
1486.02,4.74,huge like something draws the values
1488.059,4.201,dropped and now is a much lower but if
1490.76,3.6,you look at the values you can see that
1492.26,5.34,the difference is around 10 percent yeah
1494.36,5.34,so the authors on purpose cut of the
1497.6,4.62,part of the visualization maybe he
1499.7,4.02,wanted to mislead some people and uh to
1502.22,3.36,make them think that the things are
1503.72,4.579,different from the reality yeah so
1505.58,5.4,please don't do it
1508.299,4.781,now I want to show a couple of examples
1510.98,3.66,of good visualizations here you can see
1513.08,4.62,the link at the bottom of the screen
1514.64,4.26,just do this visualization so basically
1517.7,3.359,I think it's like an awesome
1518.9,3.84,visualization it's first of all it's
1521.059,5.461,like pleasing to the eye it has nice
1522.74,6.72,colors next it has a lot of data so we
1526.52,5.58,have categories we have two two groups
1529.46,5.16,of people we have ages we have their
1532.1,4.26,values for some variable and also we
1534.62,4.38,have the highlight of the most important
1536.36,4.98,part of the graph so it's like this plot
1539.0,4.559,is concise it's aesthetically pleasing
1541.34,4.079,and it prevents information a lot of
1543.559,3.48,information is an understandable way
1545.419,4.201,yeah
1547.039,5.701,another plot from the same cargo
1549.62,6.48,notebook it's like it uses a very cool
1552.74,5.939,type of chart so basically when you want
1556.1,4.98,to show the quantities or percentages of
1558.679,4.801,some variable you could use some buyer
1561.08,5.579,charts in this case we have multiple
1563.48,6.24,variables multiple categories and we use
1566.659,5.041,a stacked bar chart but if you used we
1569.72,4.62,used like absolute values we would have
1571.7,3.9,bar charts with very different heights
1574.34,3.24,and it would be very difficult to
1575.6,5.34,compare them but here we can see that
1577.58,5.64,all the values sum up to 100 so it's
1580.94,4.859,very easy to compare them yeah so it's
1583.22,4.68,like an amazing tool showing how to
1585.799,3.801,compare different values for many
1587.9,4.68,categories
1589.6,5.439,no this is an extremely simple but at
1592.58,5.82,the same time like awesome chart it's a
1595.039,5.221,pair plot from Seaborn so it shows a lot
1598.4,4.32,of things it shows a variable
1600.26,4.62,distribution it shows clusters of the
1602.72,4.38,data based on the class it shows
1604.88,5.46,configure interaction so it's like
1607.1,4.98,extremely easy to use very aesthetically
1610.34,3.839,pleasing and shows the very useful
1612.08,3.78,information so for example we considered
1614.179,4.401,one of the classes is very difficult
1615.86,6.0,from the others yeah
1618.58,7.18,uh this is a completely different type
1621.86,5.52,of visualization it's a Kepler tool for
1625.76,4.019,visualizing High dimensional
1627.38,5.1,geographical data it was developed by
1629.779,4.861,Uber so if you have like a lot of the
1632.48,4.38,data a lot of geographical data which
1634.64,5.519,you want to show on the plot it's a
1636.86,5.22,perfect rule for this purpose because it
1640.159,5.0,supports showing like millions of points
1642.08,3.079,and it's very cool
1645.279,4.541,now now I want to show how to use
1647.96,3.719,visualizations for machine learning for
1649.82,4.68,interpreting the models for showing the
1651.679,5.1,models and so on this tool you can see a
1654.5,5.159,visualization from a library called shop
1656.779,6.241,so it's for explaining machine learning
1659.659,5.341,models uh you can see here that there
1663.02,3.779,are like multiple things shown on the
1665.0,3.24,screen when you see this Library it
1666.799,3.901,could be pretty difficult to understand
1668.24,5.22,it but after you get used to it it's
1670.7,5.4,like awesome because it shows a lot of
1673.46,5.699,information in a conscious way basically
1676.1,5.459,it shows that for example High although
1679.159,4.741,values of some variable how do they
1681.559,4.201,contribute to the Target variable so for
1683.9,5.34,example if we have some classification
1685.76,5.94,for a binary we have two classes and we
1689.24,5.039,see that blue values are on the left
1691.7,5.4,part of the screen then we say that the
1694.279,4.621,low is this value variable the more
1697.1,4.14,chances that the class is zero the
1698.9,4.92,higher this variable the high chance of
1701.24,5.64,this class is one some other variables
1703.82,5.76,are different yes they're open so it's
1706.88,4.62,like it's easy to put and it's very
1709.58,4.68,useful pointer opening things and that
1711.5,4.559,often is used for industry it's really a
1714.26,4.5,business key to understand it so it can
1716.059,5.941,be used and it very it really helps to
1718.76,7.019,explain people how the models work
1722.0,6.299,this is another type of Port it ports
1725.779,4.441,modern buildings so there are many ways
1728.299,4.801,to create more than weddings like Fast
1730.22,4.439,text Perth and many other things but
1733.1,5.52,usually they have a huge dimensionality
1734.659,7.02,like 300 values 700 values or more so
1738.62,5.1,you can't compare them directly but if
1741.679,4.081,you do some dimensionality reduction and
1743.72,3.839,put them in two-dimensional space you
1745.76,3.72,can see some awesome scenes so here you
1747.559,4.801,see different clusters you can see that
1749.48,5.819,some words belong to specific groups and
1752.36,4.76,you can understand them much better
1755.299,5.461,yeah
1757.12,6.039,uh next this is the the screenshot from
1760.76,5.34,weights and biases weights and biases is
1763.159,5.281,a cool library and like local new
1766.1,4.559,library it's like huge platform for
1768.44,4.619,login machine learning model training
1770.659,4.74,for example here you can see that
1773.059,4.921,someone made a heapers parameter of
1775.399,5.701,optimization for some gradient boosting
1777.98,5.52,model yes or maybe no I think it's for
1781.1,4.02,neural Nets so and the main thing is
1783.5,3.659,like you can see on the left part of the
1785.12,4.799,screen different experiments and you can
1787.159,4.921,select only several of them you can see
1789.919,4.26,how different keeper parameters
1792.08,3.38,influence the accuracy and you can see
1794.179,5.701,that some of them
1795.46,7.24,have have like high values of the first
1799.88,5.76,variable they have a high impact on
1802.7,4.979,accuracy some have low impact you can
1805.64,4.919,see that some of the parameters have
1807.679,5.701,like values and uh like some here
1810.559,4.681,parameters have a higher influence on
1813.38,4.44,the model performance are lower so it's
1815.24,4.38,better to optimize only some of them you
1817.82,3.9,can see the best performance you can see
1819.62,4.32,compare training plots for different
1821.72,4.679,brands so it's like an extremely great
1823.94,6.18,visualization and it's used in practice
1826.399,6.66,for comparing the models
1830.12,5.46,this is sharper game and it can be used
1833.059,4.62,not only for tabular data but also for
1835.58,4.86,some neural Nets so in this case it's
1837.679,5.22,for Imaging we can say that when we have
1840.44,5.4,this image it's a photo of an apple and
1842.899,4.621,the strawberry when we try to predict a
1845.84,3.78,strawberry we can see that some part of
1847.52,4.62,the image is very important like it's
1849.62,4.679,logical but when we try to predict some
1852.14,4.259,completely different classes then there
1854.299,5.041,is nothing useful in the image and we
1856.399,5.64,can see that nothing is highlighted
1859.34,4.5,another tool which is also used for
1862.039,5.341,analysis analyzing the images and the
1863.84,6.48,models for images use grotcom basically
1867.38,4.98,it shows activations on different layers
1870.32,4.079,of the network so you can see that for
1872.36,4.26,example we try to do something with an
1874.399,5.4,image of pizza and you can see that
1876.62,5.039,different parts of neural net highlight
1879.799,4.321,different parts of the images so this
1881.659,4.561,way you can see how some internal layers
1884.12,4.32,of neural network work yeah it's pretty
1886.22,4.38,cool and can be useful to improve the
1888.44,4.92,model performance
1890.6,5.579,this is a different tool it's called
1893.36,5.58,neuron it shows it can show the model
1896.179,4.38,structure it's the model agnostic it's
1898.94,3.479,like framework agnostic so you can use
1900.559,3.901,it for by torch for tensorflow for
1902.419,4.98,carrots for some other libraries you can
1904.46,5.459,use it for on a mix and for many other
1907.399,5.581,formats and it will show the structure
1909.919,5.88,of the neural net in details yeah so
1912.98,4.38,there are some inbuilt capabilities and
1915.799,4.74,different Frameworks for making
1917.36,4.86,visualizations of the structure but here
1920.539,4.62,you can see it's like presented in a
1922.22,5.1,very nice way and it's easy to look at
1925.159,4.041,it to share it and so on so it's like a
1927.32,5.16,great tool
1929.2,5.859,uh now this was most of the things that
1932.48,4.98,I wanted to say yeah you can see there
1935.059,4.681,are several pages with references so you
1937.46,4.26,can see the examples of the plots you
1939.74,4.08,can see the code from the plots which I
1941.72,5.1,may which I showed to you you can see
1943.82,5.7,some additional thoughts and uh some
1946.82,4.38,blog posts about them also if you are
1949.52,3.84,interested like in pursuing that
1951.2,3.78,visualization more seriously I would
1953.36,4.08,suggest joining data visualization
1954.98,4.799,Society it's a huge Society of
1957.44,4.92,professionals working in naturalization
1959.779,4.5,industry yeah I'm part of it and it's
1962.36,4.559,pretty interesting and cool
1964.279,5.461,so these were the things which I wanted
1966.919,5.281,to talk about like so that resolution is
1969.74,4.08,an interesting topic like it can be
1972.2,3.9,interesting both in theoretical and
1973.82,4.14,practical matters there's a lot of ways
1976.1,2.939,to make simple visualizations there are
1977.96,3.42,a lot of ways to make some awesome
1979.039,4.14,visualizations and it's up to you to
1981.38,5.7,decide where you want to draw the line
1983.179,6.0,and to make the plot yeah so these are
1987.08,4.74,my contacts I hope this talk was
1989.179,4.081,interesting to you and now I can answer
1991.82,3.739,the questions because if you're left in
1993.26,2.299,the chat
1998.5,4.779,do you want me to read out the questions
2000.519,4.981,or how do you want to do this
2003.279,5.061,I can agree with myself if you are oh
2005.5,5.94,okay it isn't sure
2008.34,5.02,sorry sir but uh I'd request you to read
2011.44,3.359,out the questions as well so that the
2013.36,2.819,larger audience knows what the question
2014.799,3.661,is about
2016.179,3.781,okay yes so I'll start with the
2018.46,4.88,questions from the chat and then I'll
2019.96,6.42,move to the Q a section
2023.34,4.66,okay sorry please uh I mean the
2026.38,3.6,questions will will take all the
2028.0,4.019,questions to the question and answer you
2029.98,4.86,needn't worry about the chat section
2032.019,5.821,okay sure so okay
2034.84,5.339,first one uh how do you connect data
2037.84,6.36,visualizations from python in to nice
2040.179,6.6,infographics so I think I showed the
2044.2,6.719,some examples of the plots in my
2046.779,6.36,presentations basically if you want to
2050.919,5.401,make some interactive plots you would
2053.139,6.48,use broadly or for example Tire if you
2056.32,5.4,want to use some simple mobile flexible
2059.619,5.22,plots you could use for example metal
2061.72,5.1,clip the examples we showed are pretty
2064.839,4.08,basic but it's really possible to make
2066.82,5.12,very nice infographics in MacBook leap
2068.919,8.121,but interactive is yeah it's more about
2071.94,5.1,broadly bokeh and Altair for example
2077.859,4.441,um the next question can we make
2079.96,4.679,visualization model of data like
2082.3,5.64,progressing of spreading disease and
2084.639,5.581,timeline on the map with real data or
2087.94,4.459,how we could do that or where we could
2090.22,5.82,find how to do that
2092.399,7.121,yeah it's pretty possible I would think
2096.04,5.52,that there are well right now I can
2099.52,3.42,think about two approaches so for
2101.56,4.559,example in Python there are two
2102.94,5.52,libraries which a good mention the first
2106.119,7.801,one is again probably another one is
2108.46,7.56,volume so following is a library for
2113.92,4.5,um showing visualizations of
2116.02,5.94,geographical data so basically it has a
2118.42,5.82,map and you can do anything on it and it
2121.96,5.22,supports uh supports different widgets
2124.24,7.02,and for example it it has some time
2127.18,6.0,access so basically you can make like a
2131.26,3.78,lot of visualizations for each point of
2133.18,3.96,time so basically you have your data set
2135.04,4.559,and you have a column showing some point
2137.14,4.979,of them for example the date and then
2139.599,4.861,you will be able to make putting volume
2142.119,5.101,where you will be able to show to move
2144.46,5.04,the slider of the time and show show how
2147.22,3.72,the disease is spread over the time and
2149.5,4.14,something similar could be done in
2150.94,5.76,broadly it isn't supposed to be used for
2153.64,4.62,with all this in geographical data but
2156.7,4.94,there are some plugins and support for
2158.26,5.88,it and I also use it for showing some
2161.64,6.18,geodata so it's pretty possible yeah you
2164.14,3.68,can find it for example living in cargo
2168.04,6.02,um the next question is what do we use
2170.92,6.36,nowadays for interactive dashboards
2174.06,8.26,uh as I already said for example in
2177.28,8.04,Python it's uh Dash in R it's uh would
2182.32,4.56,be shining also if you use Python right
2185.32,5.4,now there is an awesome Library called
2186.88,6.6,stream leap it allows you to make uh
2190.72,4.139,like to make websites very easily and of
2193.48,4.56,course uh you could include
2194.859,5.76,visualizations in them and the it's very
2198.04,4.62,easy to publish your like what you do
2200.619,4.381,and it's very easy to make like several
2202.66,4.62,tabs several plots several
2205.0,5.46,visualizations so I suggest trying
2207.28,4.86,streamlined it's widely used for showing
2210.46,3.78,some kind of analysis it's used in
2212.14,5.12,organization and I use them for example
2214.24,5.7,in my in my current company too
2217.26,5.8,yeah so that's it
2219.94,4.98,uh next question is I also worry about
2223.06,4.5,which color combinations to use in
2224.92,5.28,graphs uh do you have any tips and
2227.56,5.1,tricks about color combinations can I
2230.2,6.06,keep using same combinations for all my
2232.66,6.24,graphs thanks yeah so first of all if
2236.26,5.339,you look at the references in my slides
2238.9,7.32,you will see several links to the
2241.599,6.721,articles about selecting uh like colors
2246.22,4.26,for the visualization basically I would
2248.32,5.519,say is there are three General
2250.48,6.3,approaches the first one is that you use
2253.839,5.341,some color maps from the library so for
2256.78,4.62,example in R and in Python in most
2259.18,5.399,libraries you could select some color
2261.4,4.62,map so color map is uh is like it
2264.579,3.721,defines the colors used in the
2266.02,4.38,visualization and the Styles so you can
2268.3,4.2,just use one of the popular Styles and
2270.4,4.38,it will be fine yeah so you don't you
2272.5,3.72,won't be you won't have to select every
2274.78,4.559,color by yourself
2276.22,4.8,another point is when you select the
2279.339,3.901,columns by yourself each time for each
2281.02,5.7,plot it's very time consuming but it
2283.24,5.64,could be satisfying but again as you
2286.72,4.44,answered asked if it's possible to use
2288.88,4.62,the same combination for all the graphs
2291.16,5.22,yes it would be like your own style
2293.5,5.22,guide so you at first decide that for
2296.38,4.26,example you like using I don't know uh
2298.72,3.899,yellow and green colors on your plugs
2300.64,3.719,yeah then you would Define them in some
2302.619,3.841,settings of your library and you use
2304.359,4.621,them by yourself later so it will be
2306.46,5.28,like your own personal style guide and
2308.98,4.44,those people who make visualizations
2311.74,3.9,professionally often have their own
2313.42,4.76,style so it's like a great idea it's
2315.64,5.04,good that it's not about it
2318.18,5.399,uh next question
2320.68,7.5,how would you present sharp values for
2323.579,5.821,121 features top to 80 covered by 77 of
2328.18,4.14,the feature
2329.4,5.32,I would say that it's like a lot of
2332.32,4.799,features first of all I'm not sure if
2334.72,6.48,you would really need all of them yeah
2337.119,6.361,because it's like too many fishes but if
2341.2,4.8,we really need to show all of them I
2343.48,6.0,would do something like that first of
2346.0,6.06,all I would calculate shape values then
2349.48,5.82,I would make two separate clothes one
2352.06,5.34,for example for top 10 or top 20 fishes
2355.3,3.96,because they're most important they have
2357.4,3.36,the most impact and the second thought
2359.26,3.66,for the rest of the features so
2360.76,4.02,basically people who don't have enough
2362.92,3.78,attention will just look at the first
2364.78,3.36,plot and people who have enough time and
2366.7,5.0,attention will look at the second clock
2368.14,3.56,so I think it will work
2371.98,4.619,um
2373.359,6.621,which visualization tool is best power
2376.599,6.061,bi Tableau operation libraries
2379.98,5.5,I would say that it depends on the
2382.66,4.679,purpose like it would depend on how many
2385.48,3.84,time how much time do you have at hand
2387.339,4.081,how much experience do you have these
2389.32,4.86,programming languages and what is used
2391.42,6.12,in your company so for example if you
2394.18,5.399,work in some company usually they
2397.54,4.92,already have some software for making
2399.579,4.861,visualization so for example if in a
2402.46,3.72,company it's commonly accepted that
2404.44,4.919,everyone should use Tableau or everyone
2406.18,5.46,should use power bi to present uh close
2409.359,4.381,to each other then like you won't have
2411.64,3.959,much choice you will have to use it yeah
2413.74,3.72,next point if you're comfortable with
2415.599,3.661,using programming languages then you of
2417.46,4.32,course can use right person libraries
2419.26,5.099,the only question is will be how would
2421.78,5.22,you show this plot so you can't expect
2424.359,4.381,people just to launch YouTube feature
2427.0,3.72,notebook and look at it you will either
2428.74,5.46,have to share screenshots or you will
2430.72,5.28,have to post your code in some way yeah
2434.2,4.04,so it's like really depends on the use
2436.0,2.24,case
2438.339,3.661,um
2439.48,5.94,the next question do you have a roadmap
2442.0,4.2,for becoming a databilization expert
2445.42,4.32,um
2446.2,6.24,I don't have really a roadmap but for
2449.74,4.8,example on one of my slides there was an
2452.44,4.1,information about which skills do you
2454.54,4.2,need for
2456.54,4.66,to become an expert in that
2458.74,5.4,visualization you could just use it like
2461.2,4.62,at the start and then research how to
2464.14,4.64,improve your skills in each of the areas
2465.82,2.96,I mentioned in this slide
2469.839,4.74,um next question is you showed us a lot
2472.42,4.62,of good examples but how can you create
2474.579,5.881,it often I see that such full charts are
2477.04,5.88,made with uh in this in the skin or
2480.46,5.22,something like that because Japan and Co
2482.92,4.439,are too limited what do you prefer yes
2485.68,3.72,this is a good point and I mentioned
2487.359,4.5,that the most beautiful visualizations
2489.4,5.76,are usually created by rent or in visual
2491.859,7.021,visual editors yeah but again for
2495.16,6.419,example I showed this uh several slides
2498.88,4.5,with cool data visualizations I think
2501.579,4.741,the for example that these
2503.38,4.86,visualizations like look pretty good and
2506.32,3.72,you can use you can make them
2508.24,4.619,importantly you can see the link at the
2510.04,4.62,bottom of the screen yeah but yeah if
2512.859,4.26,you want to make something perfect you
2514.66,5.4,would need to delve deeper so one of the
2517.119,4.861,options is using day 3.js you will have
2520.06,3.6,to learn JavaScript but you will be able
2521.98,6.32,to produce amazing database validation
2523.66,4.64,yeah uh if you want to
2529.56,6.76,you will have to do it by hand or by
2532.56,6.4,using some visual editor so like if you
2536.32,4.5,have a lot of time and like uh your job
2538.96,3.899,is about creating it for utilizations
2540.82,5.279,you will have to do it but if
2542.859,5.701,visualization is like a small a small or
2546.099,4.74,well not very small but like only one of
2548.56,4.14,the parts of a drop it's like much more
2550.839,5.881,efficient to use the libraries like
2552.7,6.62,visual button python or uh but broadly
2556.72,5.49,and just find a good color scheme to use
2559.32,3.46,to use and show
2562.21,2.149,[Music]
2562.78,4.2,um
2564.359,6.601,the next question is are there any
2566.98,6.98,resources to develop storytelling skill
2570.96,5.56,it's difficult to say because basically
2573.96,4.54,storytelling is like a combination of
2576.52,4.26,various skills first of all it's about
2578.5,5.78,creating the good presentation or good
2580.78,6.66,resultation itself another one is
2584.28,5.98,like having some good presentation
2587.44,5.46,skills capturing your audience making
2590.26,6.9,good accents noticing when your audience
2592.9,7.5,become like more bored and like like in
2597.16,5.82,living in them it's also about being
2600.4,5.64,able to make a good story so I would
2602.98,5.46,suppose that you need to understand what
2606.04,4.5,is storytelling is about which skills do
2608.44,4.32,you need to create a storytelling so
2610.54,5.52,like I said good presentation creating
2612.76,5.579,the presentation oratory skills uh
2616.06,7.1,understanding the audience and then work
2618.339,4.821,on each of the skills step by step yeah
2623.44,5.879,um next question
2626.52,5.799,about classical switch engineering
2629.319,6.061,very often there are similar steps can
2632.319,6.121,you advise some after email framework
2635.38,5.219,for visual validation I know Picard has
2638.44,4.379,something but maybe other
2640.599,4.561,as far as I know there is a pandas
2642.819,5.04,profiling it's a cool Library which will
2645.16,4.86,show a lot of visualizations for your
2647.859,4.201,variables most of them will be like
2650.02,3.9,monotonics new edit so like
2652.06,3.84,visualization only for single feature
2653.92,4.08,but it's pretty good it shows a lot of
2655.9,5.18,Statistics a lot of visualization so
2658.0,3.599,it's a great start so you could try it
2661.08,2.519,[Music]
2661.599,2.0,um
2663.96,5.8,next question I am fresh out of which
2667.06,5.039,visualization too you prefer to me then
2669.76,4.2,I would say just use Python and Seaborn
2672.099,4.101,for example almost it will be a good
2673.96,2.24,start
2676.56,7.24,uh and another question is uh
2681.52,4.68,sometimes I find it difficult to select
2683.8,4.799,the type of photograph can you elaborate
2686.2,4.919,or give more tips on when and which type
2688.599,4.74,of Charities visualization like for time
2691.119,4.98,series that which one to use and when we
2693.339,5.041,group the data then which one previews
2696.099,5.341,I had a section in my presentation about
2698.38,9.18,different ways of equalizing the data so
2701.44,8.7,like this for example if you have some
2707.56,5.34,cream series there is some specific
2710.14,4.32,types of visualization if you have like
2712.9,3.36,network data there are other types of
2714.46,4.44,visualization in the reference section
2716.26,4.2,you can find the links to this plot you
2718.9,3.24,will be able to see all the plot it's
2720.46,3.48,like I wasn't able to make a full
2722.14,3.84,screenshot because the plot is very huge
2723.94,3.6,yeah but you will be able to see which
2725.98,4.56,visualization should you use in which
2727.54,6.43,case so it's like uh you will be able to
2730.54,4.02,find this information by references
2733.97,1.129,[Music]
2734.56,1.799,um
2735.099,3.841,okay
2736.359,6.5,next question is which is better to show
2738.94,7.2,correlation cutter plots or heat Maps
2742.859,6.46,basically I would say they are both to
2746.14,6.06,good things but they depend on the
2749.319,5.161,nature of your data so for example if
2752.2,4.26,you have two numerical variables to
2754.48,4.5,continuous variables it's much easier to
2756.46,6.3,use the scatter plot between them yeah
2758.98,6.18,but heat map is I would say it's uh it's
2762.76,3.839,better when you have some categories so
2765.16,3.5,for example you have two categorical
2766.599,6.72,variables and you want to show the
2768.66,6.34,values of color across like different
2773.319,3.841,values of the combinations of these two
2775.0,4.64,features then it would be easier to use
2777.16,2.48,a heat map
2779.859,6.181,um so it was two questions
2782.68,5.28,next one what to do if I didn't find the
2786.04,3.66,influential factors in the date to know
2787.96,3.96,in order to predict the right decision
2789.7,4.13,and what is the best tool to know the
2791.92,2.04,factors
2793.83,1.749,[Music]
2793.96,4.44,um
2795.579,5.0,I would say that okay so I suppose it's
2798.4,5.459,more about machine learning so basically
2800.579,5.561,uh we need we need to know the most
2803.859,6.781,influential features in the data to make
2806.14,6.3,the model yeah uh I would say that if
2810.64,3.959,you want to start then you can simply
2812.44,3.78,train some model for example if you step
2814.599,3.781,over data you could just take some
2816.22,4.68,gradient boosting model or in the forest
2818.38,5.04,you train it then you use for example
2820.9,5.459,shop or some other library to see Fisher
2823.42,5.76,importance and you can consider this uh
2826.359,4.74,which is to be most influential then you
2829.18,3.54,could create some features and see that
2831.099,5.361,maybe the new features will be even
2832.72,3.74,better than the additional ones
2837.64,5.459,um another question this is a very
2840.579,5.341,beautiful presentation may we have it or
2843.099,4.98,code being used in the presentation
2845.92,4.8,uh yes of course I will share the link
2848.079,5.341,with the hosts and they will share it
2850.72,4.379,with everyone using email so you will
2853.42,3.96,have the link to the whole presentation
2855.099,6.121,and every content in it
2857.38,6.68,I see some people raise hands so how how
2861.22,2.84,do we manage it
2864.46,4.859,um most of the uh raised hands I mean
2867.28,5.039,the questions they had have been put
2869.319,7.821,into the Q a section
2872.319,4.821,um so that's pretty much it so
2877.54,5.88,okay if anyone has any questions you can
2880.18,5.76,again post them on the Q a and I will
2883.42,5.28,answer them yes guys we have a couple
2885.94,5.22,more minutes as well uh to anyone if you
2888.7,5.76,have questions if you do please post
2891.16,4.56,those questions in the Q a section
2894.46,4.08,um there were actually a couple of
2895.72,5.16,people's people who have raised their
2898.54,5.779,hands and I had asked them to put their
2900.88,3.439,questions in the Q a section so
2904.66,4.74,um and for all others uh just wanted to
2908.14,4.62,let you know
2909.4,4.5,we have put up a feedback poll please do
2912.76,3.839,fill in
2913.9,5.219,okay so you have a question here
2916.599,6.841,it's the question please post quote and
2919.119,6.901,the presentation it will be sent okay
2923.44,5.94,see guys we've repeatedly told you all
2926.02,6.059,that you'll get these files via a mail
2929.38,5.82,so don't worry about it
2932.079,5.341,um so um I guess that's the end of it uh
2935.2,3.72,thank you thank you Mr Luke and Uncle
2937.42,3.6,thanks for the session
2938.92,4.62,um on behalf of analytics video I'd like
2941.02,4.799,to uh thank you for your time and for
2943.54,4.2,you know delivering such wonderful
2945.819,3.841,knowledge
2947.74,4.74,um and also for being patient with all
2949.66,6.6,these questions we had I must say
2952.48,4.859,a bit more questions than we usually do
2956.26,3.54,um
2957.339,3.661,and I hope you have a wonderful day in
2959.8,3.18,Moscow
