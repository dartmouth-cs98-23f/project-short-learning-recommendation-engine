0.16,3.37,"Hi, I’m Jabril and welcome back to
CrashCourse AI."
3.53,5.37,"Algorithms are just math and code, but algorithms
are created by people and use our data, so"
8.901,5.658,"biases that exist in the real world are mimicked
or even exaggerated by AI systems."
14.56,2.42,This idea is called algorithmic bias.
16.98,2.78,Bias isn’t inherently a terrible thing.
19.769,3.571,"Our brains try to take shortcuts by finding
patterns in data."
23.34,4.9,"So if you’ve only seen small, tiny dogs,
you might see a Great Dane and be like “Whoa"
28.24,1.79,that dog is unnatural”
30.03,3.81,"This doesn’t become a problem unless we
don’t acknowledge exceptions to patterns"
33.84,3.78,"or unless we start treating certain groups
of people unfairly."
37.62,5.06,"As a society, we have laws to prevent discrimination
based on certain “protected classes” (like"
42.68,3.399,"gender, race, or age) for things like employment
or housing."
46.079,5.721,"So it’s important to be aware of the difference
between bias, which we all have, and discrimination,"
51.8,1.0,which we can prevent.
52.8,4.68,"And knowing about algorithmic bias can help
us steer clear of a future where AI are used"
57.48,1.92,"in harmful, discriminatory ways."
59.4,8.64,INTRO
68.04,4.14,"There are at least 5 types of algorithmic
bias we should pay attention to."
72.19,3.47,"First, training data can reflect hidden biases
in society."
75.66,4.09,"For example, if an AI was trained on recent
news articles or books, the word “nurse”"
79.75,3.82,"is more likely to refer to a “woman,”
while the word “programmer” is more likely"
83.57,1.69,to refer to a “man.”
85.26,4.64,"And you can see this happening with a Google
image search: “nurse” shows mostly women,"
89.9,2.15,"while “programmer” mostly shows mostly
men."
92.05,4.41,"We can see how hidden biases in the data gets
embedded in search engine AI."
96.46,4.48,"Of course, we know there are male nurses and
female programmers and non-binary people doing"
100.94,1.12,both of these jobs!
102.06,5.17,"For example, an image search for “programmer
1960” shows a LOT more women."
107.23,5.29,"But AI algorithms aren’t very good at recognizing
cultural biases that might change over time,"
112.52,3.21,"and they could even be spreading hidden biases
to more human brains."
115.73,3.4,"t’s also tempting to think that if we just
don’t collect or use training data that"
119.13,5.15,"categorizes protected classes like race or
gender, then our algorithms can’t possibly"
124.28,0.52,discriminate.
124.8,4.72,"But, protected classes may emerge as correlated
features, which are features that aren’t"
129.52,4.84,"explicitly in data but may be unintentionally
correlated to a specific prediction."
134.36,4.58,"For example, because many places in the US
are still extremely segregated, zip code can"
138.94,1.92,be strongly correlated to race.
140.86,3.32,"A record of purchases can be strongly correlated
to gender."
144.18,5.04,"And a controversial 2017 paper showed that
sexual orientation is strongly correlated"
149.22,3.03,"with characteristics of a social media profile
photo."
152.25,4.64,"Second, the training data may not have enough
examples of each class, which can affect the"
156.89,1.61,accuracy of predictions.
158.5,5.05,"For example, many facial recognition AI algorithms
are trained on data that includes way more"
163.55,3.07,"examples of white peoples’ faces than other
races."
166.62,4.281,"One story that made the news a few years ago
is a passport photo checker with an AI system"
170.901,3.209,to warn if the person in the photo had blinked.
174.11,4.13,"But the system had a lot of trouble with photos
of people of Asian descent."
178.24,4.35,"Being asked to take a photo again and again
would be really frustrating if you’re just"
182.59,3.32,"trying to renew your passport, which is already
sort of a pain!"
185.91,5.23,"Or, let’s say, you got a cool gig programming
a drone for IBM… but it has trouble recognizing"
191.14,4.55,"your face because your skin’s too dark…
for example."
195.69,3.75,"Third, it’s hard to quantify certain features
in training data."
199.44,2.72,"There are lots of things that are tough to
describe with numbers."
202.16,3.43,"Like can you really rate a sibling relationship
with a number?"
205.59,1.09,It’s complicated!
206.68,4.92,"You love them, but you hate how messy they
are, but you like cooking together, but you"
211.6,1.6,hate how your parents compare you...
213.2,1.92,It’s so hard to quantify all that!
215.12,5.4,"In many cases, we try to build AI to evaluate
complicated qualities of data, but sometimes"
220.52,2.549,we have to settle for easily measurable shortcuts.
223.069,5.121,"One recent example is trying to use AI to
grade writing on standardized tests like SATs"
228.19,3.33,"and GREs with the goal to save human graders
time."
231.52,4.78,"Good writing involves complex elements like
clarity, structure, and creativity, but most"
236.3,1.86,of these qualities are hard to measure.
238.16,5.53,"So, instead, these AI focused on easier-to-measure
elements like sentence length, vocabulary,"
243.69,4.44,"and grammar, which don’t fully represent
good writing… and made these AIs easier"
248.13,1.0,to fool.
249.13,4.38,"Some students from MIT built a natural language
program to create essays that made NO sense,"
253.51,3.11,but were rated highly by these grading algorithms.
256.62,4.23,"These AIs could also potentially be fooled
by memorizing portions of “template” essays"
260.85,4.83,"to influence the score, rather than actually
writing a response to the prompt, all because"
265.68,2.57,"of the training data that was used for these
scoring AI."
268.25,3.88,"Fourth, the algorithm could influence the
data that it gets, creating a positive feedback"
272.13,1.0,loop.
273.13,4.33,"A positive feedback loop basically means “amplifying
what happened in the past”… whether or"
277.46,2.07,not this amplification is good.
279.53,4.851,"An example is PredPol’s drug crime prediction
algorithm, which has been in use since 2012"
284.381,3.469,in many large cities including LA and Chicago.
287.85,4.421,"PredPol was trained on data that was heavily
biased by past housing segregation and past"
292.271,1.699,cases of police bias.
293.97,3.85,"So, it would more frequently send police to
certain neighborhoods where a lot of racial"
297.82,1.56,minority folks lived.
299.38,4.37,"Arrests in those neighborhoods increased,
that arrest data was fed back into the algorithm,"
303.75,3.61,"and the AI would predict more future drug
arrests in those neighborhoods and send the"
307.36,1.52,police there again.
308.88,3.39,"Even though there might be crime in neighborhoods
where police weren’t being sent by this"
312.27,5.07,"AI, because there weren't any arrests in those
neighborhoods, data about them wasn’t fed"
317.34,1.47,back into the algorithm.
318.81,4.79,"While algorithms like PredPol are still in
use, to try and manage these feedback effects,"
323.6,3.89,"there is currently more effort to monitor
and adjust how they process data."
327.49,4.34,"So basically, this would be like a new principal
who was hired to improve the average grades"
331.83,4.91,"of a school, but he doesn’t really care
about the students who already have good grades."
336.74,4.3,"He creates a watchlist of students who have
really bad grades and checks up on them every"
341.04,3.58,"week, and he ignores the students who keep
up with good grades."
344.62,5.74,"If any of the students on his watchlist don’t
do their homework that week, they get punished."
350.36,3.839,"But all of the students NOT on his watchlist
can slack on their homework, and get away"
354.199,3.391,with it based on “what happened in the past.”
357.59,4.0,"This is essentially what’s happening with
PredPol, and you can be the judge if you believe"
361.59,1.359,it’s fair or not.
362.949,4.0,"Finally, a group of people may mess with training
data on purpose."
366.949,4.72,"For example, in 2014, Microsoft released a
chatbot named Xiaoice in China."
371.669,2.881,"People could chat with Xiaoice so it would
learn how to speak naturally on a variety"
374.55,2.56,of topics from these conversations.
377.11,4.44,"It worked great, and Xiaoice had over 40 million
conversations with no incidents."
381.55,5.19,"In 2016, Microsoft tried the same thing in
the U.S. by releasing the Twitterbot Tay."
386.74,4.459,"Tay trained on direct conversation threads
on Twitter, and by playing games with users"
391.199,2.25,"where they could get it to repeat what they
were saying."
393.449,4.821,"In 12 hours after its release, after a “coordinated
attack by a subset of people” who biased"
398.27,4.97,"its data set, Tay started posting violent,
sexist, anti-semitic, and racist Tweets."
403.24,4.179,"This kind of manipulation is usually framed
as “joking” or “trolling,” but the"
407.419,4.31,"fact that AI can be manipulated means we should
take algorithmic predictions with a grain"
411.729,1.0,of salt.
412.729,2.97,"This is why I don’t leave John-Green-Bot
alone online…"
415.699,4.901,"The common theme of algorithmic bias is that
AI systems are trying to make good predictions,"
420.6,1.83,but they make mistakes.
422.43,4.79,"Some of these mistakes may be harmless or
mildly inconvenient, but others may have significant"
427.22,1.0,consequences.
428.22,3.26,"To understand the key limitations of AI in
our current society, let’s go to the Thought"
431.48,1.74,Bubble.
433.22,3.74,"Let’s say there’s an AI system called
HireMe! that gives hiring recommendations"
436.96,1.19,to companies.
438.15,4.87,"HireMe is being used by Robots Weekly, a magazine
where John-Green-bot applied for an editorial"
443.02,1.0,job.
444.02,4.07,"Just by chance, the last two people named
“John” got fired from Robots Weekly and"
448.09,3.31,"another three “Johns” didn’t make it
through the hiring process."
451.4,5.13,"So, when John-Green-Bot applies for the job,
HireMe! predicts that he’s only 24% likely"
456.53,2.949,to be employed by the company in 3 years.
459.479,4.69,"Seeing this prediction, the hiring manager
at Robots Weekly rejects John-Green-bot, and"
464.169,1.831,this data gets added to the HireMe!
466.0,1.039,AI system.
467.039,3.601,"John-Green-Bot is just another “John”
that got rejected, even though he may have"
470.64,1.94,been the perfect robot for the job!
472.58,3.5,"Now, future “Johns” have an even lower
chance to be hired."
476.08,5.059,"It’s a positive feedback loop, with some
pretty negative consequences for John-Green-Bot."
481.139,5.281,"Of course, being named “John” isn’t
a protected class, but this could apply to"
486.42,1.41,other groups of people.
487.83,2.16,"Plus, even though algorithms like HireMe!"
489.99,4.79,"Are great at establishing a link between two
kinds of data, they can’t always clarify"
494.78,1.68,why they’re making predictions.
496.46,4.48,"For example, HireMe! may find that higher
age is associated with lower knowledge of"
500.94,4.3,"digital technologies, so the AI suggests hiring
younger applicants."
505.24,4.56,"Not only is this illegally discriminating
against the protected class of “age,”"
509.8,2.88,but the implied link also might not be true.
512.68,5.589,"John-Green-bot may be almost 40, but he runs
a robot blog and is active in online communities"
518.269,1.45,like Nerdfighteria!
519.719,5.131,"So it’s up to humans interacting with AI
systems like HireMe! to pay attention to recommendations"
524.85,4.0,"and make sure they’re fair, or adjust the
algorithms if not."
528.85,1.69,"Thanks, Thought Bubble!"
530.54,5.12,"Monitoring AI for bias and discrimination
sounds like a huge responsibility, so how"
535.66,1.0,can we do it?
536.66,3.75,"The first step is just understanding that
algorithms will be biased."
540.41,4.719,"It’s important to be critical about AI recommendations,
instead of just accepting that “the computer"
545.129,1.0,said so.”
546.129,4.871,"This is why transparency in algorithms is
so important, which is the ability to examine"
551.0,4.2,"inputs and outputs to understand why an algorithm
is giving certain recommendations."
555.209,3.81,"But that's easier said than done
when it comes to certain algorithms, like"
559.02,0.999,deep learning methods.
560.02,3.2,Hidden layers can be tricky to interpret.
563.22,5.059,"Second, if we want to have less biased algorithms,
we may need more training data on protected"
568.279,2.37,"classes like race, gender, or age."
570.649,4.141,"Looking at an algorithm’s recommendations
for protected classes may be a good way to"
574.79,1.849,check it for discrimination.
576.639,2.401,"This is kind of a double-edged sword, though."
579.04,3.95,"People who are part of protected classes may
(understandably) be worried about handing"
582.99,2.0,over personal information.
584.99,5.05,"It may feel like a violation of privacy, or
they might worry that algorithms will be misused"
590.04,2.349,to target rather than protect them.
592.389,4.25,"Even if you aren’t actively working on AI
systems, knowing about these algorithms and"
596.639,4.411,"staying informed about artificial intelligence
are really important as we shape the future"
601.05,1.209,of this field.
602.259,4.68,"Anyone, including you, can advocate for more
careful, critical interpretation of algorithmic"
606.939,2.52,outputs to help protect human rights.
609.459,4.151,"Some people are even advocating that algorithms
should be clinically tested and scrutinized"
613.61,2.029,in the same way that medicines are.
615.639,4.401,"According to these opinions, we should know
if there are “side effects” before integrating"
620.04,1.62,AI in our daily lives.
621.66,2.51,There’s nothing like that in the works yet.
624.17,4.819,"But it took over 2400 years for the Hippocratic
Oath to transform into current medical ethics"
628.989,1.181,guidelines.
630.17,4.229,"So it may take some time for us to come up
with the right set of practices."
634.399,4.461,"Next time, we have a lab and I’ll demonstrate
how there are biases in even simple things"
638.86,2.22,like trying to adopt a cat or a dog.
641.08,1.62,I’ll see ya then.
642.7,5.16,"Speaking of understanding how bias and misinformation spread, you should check out this video on Deep Fakes"
647.86,5.94,I did with Above the Noise -- another PBSDS channel that gets into the research behind controversial issues.
