5.854,1.291,"DANIEL SMILKOV: Hi, I'm Daniel."
7.145,0.99,"MARTIN WATTENBERG:
Hi, I'm Martin."
8.135,1.416,"FERNANDA VIEGAS:
Hi, I'm Fernanda."
12.4,2.36,"Machine learning
is pretty complex."
14.76,1.91,"So we've been
experimenting with ways"
16.67,2.29,to visualize what's happening.
18.96,2.48,"There's a core concept
in machine learning"
21.44,1.95,called high-dimensional space.
23.39,3.18,"Here's one way to wrap your
head around this concept."
26.57,3.12,"You can think about people
as being high-dimensional."
29.69,2.64,"For example, take
famous scientists."
32.33,3.03,"You can think about when they
were born, where they were"
35.36,2.34,"born, their fields of study."
37.7,3.06,"Each of these is like a
dimension of that person."
40.76,2.4,"These dimensions become
difficult to untangle"
43.16,2.04,"when you think about
different people,"
45.2,2.52,"because someone might
be similar in some ways,"
47.72,1.541,but very different in others.
49.261,1.999,"MARTIN WATTENBERG: But
this is the kind of thing"
51.26,1.782,"you can use machine
learning for."
53.042,1.458,"With machine
learning, the computer"
54.5,1.791,"isn't told the meaning
of these dimensions."
56.291,2.379,It just sees them as numbers.
58.67,3.03,"And it sees each set of
numbers as a data point."
61.7,2.85,"But by looking across all
of these dimensions at once,"
64.55,3.03,"it's able to place related
points closer together"
67.58,1.592,in high-dimensional space.
69.172,1.708,"DANIEL SMILKOV: Here's
a concrete example"
70.88,3.24,"where words are treated as
high-dimensional data points."
74.12,1.59,"The important thing
to remember is"
75.71,2.88,"that we haven't told the
computer the meaning of words."
78.59,2.88,"Instead, we've shown it
millions of sentences"
81.47,2.16,"as examples of how
words get used."
83.63,2.79,"Here is a visualization
of the results."
86.42,1.65,"We're looking at
a subset of words"
88.07,1.68,"that the computer
has learned about."
89.75,2.34,Each dot represents one word.
92.09,3.45,"Each word is a data point
with 200 dimensions."
95.54,2.73,"Using a technique called
t-SNE, the computer"
98.27,2.76,"clusters words together
that it considers related."
101.03,2.19,"And clusters
form-base the meaning,"
103.22,3.03,"even though we've never taught
it the meaning of words."
106.25,3.45,"Here is a cluster of
numbers, months of the year,"
109.7,5.192,"words related to space, people's
names, cities, and so on."
114.892,1.708,"FERNANDA VIEGAS: We
can also look closely"
116.6,2.04,at smaller sets of words.
118.64,3.39,"If we search ""piano,""
we can run t-SNE only"
122.03,1.74,"on words related to ""piano."
123.77,4.83,"We get clusters of composers,
genres, musical instruments,"
128.6,1.03,and more.
129.63,1.5,"MARTIN WATTENBERG:
And this approach"
131.13,1.37,doesn't just work from words.
132.5,2.55,"For example, you can
also treat an image"
135.05,1.65,"as a high-dimensional
data point."
136.7,1.95,"Here's a dataset
where lots of people"
138.65,2.22,wrote digits between 0 and 9.
140.87,2.05,"People write in
all kinds of ways."
142.92,3.53,"So the question is, instead
of us needing to manually code"
146.45,2.19,"rules for all the
ways people write,"
148.64,3.98,"could a machine figure it out
itself using machine learning?"
152.62,2.56,Each image is 784 pixels.
155.18,3.19,"The computer treats each
pixel as a dimension."
158.37,3.08,"Again, using t-SNE, it
clusters these images"
161.45,1.98,in a high-dimensional space.
163.43,2.58,"We've color-coded them so
that it's easier for us"
166.01,1.59,to see what's going on.
167.6,3.27,"And you can see groups of
digits clustering together."
170.87,3.37,"It's learned something about
the meaning of these digits."
174.24,2.0,"FERNANDA VIEGAS: These
visualizations techniques"
176.24,4.3,"we've been exploring can be
useful for all kinds of things."
180.54,2.54,"That's why we're working on
open sourcing all of this"
183.08,2.61,"as part of TensorFlow
so that anyone"
185.69,2.1,"can use these tools
to explore their data."
