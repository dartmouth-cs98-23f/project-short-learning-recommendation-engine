0.06,3.0,what's going on everybody my name is
1.709,2.34,Alex Freiburg and today we're gonna be
3.06,3.54,talking about the difference between a
4.049,4.02,data scientist and a data analyst now as
6.6,4.2,many of you know if you watch my channel
8.069,4.171,I am a data analyst but what you may not
10.8,3.209,know is that I actually work on a data
12.24,3.359,science team and so I work alongside a
14.009,3.571,lot of data scientists and so I know a
15.599,2.85,lot of the work that they do and so I
17.58,2.73,feel like I have a pretty good
18.449,4.141,understanding of each position and the
20.31,3.78,differences between these jobs and so
22.59,3.06,we're going through four main areas
24.09,4.23,today which are responsibilities
25.65,4.98,qualifications skills and then at the
28.32,3.81,very end salary and after all of that
30.63,3.72,I'm going to talk about what position
32.13,3.87,might be right for you so let's start
34.35,3.119,off with responsibilities what kind of
36.0,3.27,things are you gonna be working on in
37.469,3.991,your actual job let's start off with
39.27,3.449,data scientist as a data scientist
41.46,3.119,you're gonna be using your data to
42.719,3.151,discover opportunities and what that
44.579,3.631,means is you're gonna be using your
45.87,3.99,current data to find trends and patterns
48.21,4.11,that are gonna affect the future
49.86,4.109,business that you are working in you'll
52.32,3.69,also be developing analytical methods
53.969,3.541,and machine learning models and most
56.01,3.33,people when they think data scientists
57.51,3.389,think that is the core work that they're
59.34,3.269,gonna be doing and that is actually not
60.899,3.69,true that's actually probably five to
62.609,3.51,ten percent of their job and most of the
64.589,3.21,time they have these models set up that
66.119,3.631,they used over and over and over again
67.799,3.541,so they already know what kind of models
69.75,3.39,they're gonna be using they are just
71.34,3.09,working with the data to put it into
73.14,2.82,those models and then at the end they're
74.43,3.42,tweaking their hyper parameters to
75.96,4.26,really narrow down their accuracy and
77.85,3.839,get better results but genuinely they
80.22,2.64,aren't doing a ton of work in these
81.689,3.451,machine learning models they're not
82.86,3.99,developing new models they're just
85.14,3.9,trying to fit their data into these
86.85,4.62,models to get the best results they can
89.04,4.289,out of them the next thing is data
91.47,4.17,cleaning and when I say data cleaning I
93.329,5.04,mean a lot of data cleaning because
95.64,4.799,genuinely they are doing so much work
98.369,4.081,just cleaning their data making sure
100.439,3.811,it's gonna be good and usable for their
102.45,3.72,models so when they plug it into these
104.25,3.509,models it's gonna give them the best
106.17,3.72,results in the best output and then it's
107.759,3.75,formatted correctly for their machine
109.89,3.33,learning algorithms actually work and
111.509,3.631,actually read the data and give them the
113.22,3.99,output that they want and you'll also be
115.14,3.57,connecting a be testing now this looks
117.21,3.449,very different in different industries
118.71,4.049,but basically you're gonna be doing two
120.659,3.631,independent tests getting two different
122.759,3.511,results and seeing which one actually
124.29,4.32,gives you better results in a nutshell
126.27,4.709,that really is all AV testing is but it
128.61,4.23,can get quite complicated and so I'm not
130.979,2.59,gonna go too much into that but let's
132.84,2.92,look at the data
133.569,3.45,anoles now as a data analyst you're
135.76,3.0,gonna use your data to solve problems
137.019,3.42,that your company has right now so
138.76,3.3,instead of trying to find trends or
140.439,2.791,opportunities for the future you're
142.06,2.67,trying to answer questions that your
143.23,3.599,company has now and have an immediate
144.73,3.539,impact other responsibilities are also
146.829,3.931,creating reports or creating dashboards
148.269,4.261,and for creating reports a lot of times
150.76,3.96,you'll use either sequel or some cloud
152.53,3.75,platform or any number of other tools
154.72,3.629,that are out there for creating reports
156.28,4.44,and then for dashboards you might be
158.349,5.01,using something like power bi or tableau
160.72,4.499,or maybe even Python it just depends on
163.359,4.35,what your company is using I've seen a
165.219,4.17,very wide variety but creating reports
167.709,3.36,and dashboards can be a large part of
169.389,3.6,what a data analyst actually does and
171.069,3.54,often they'll also help with gathering
172.989,3.961,incremental data from different sources
174.609,3.931,so you need the data you have to get it
176.95,2.34,from somewhere so you may work with a
178.54,2.279,client
179.29,3.419,or an internal team to help them gather
180.819,3.661,that data or get that data into your
182.709,3.78,systems whether that's your warehouses
184.48,4.2,are just your Seigle servers or whatever
186.489,3.961,that is for your company but you have to
188.68,3.479,be getting that data somewhere and using
190.45,4.17,that data for these reports and for
192.159,4.41,these dashboards so that may also be a
194.62,3.209,part that you're doing now let's look at
196.569,2.85,the qualifications for each of these
197.829,3.84,positions and let's start out with the
199.419,3.57,data scientist as a data scientist
201.669,3.21,you're often going to need a master's
202.989,4.11,degree or above that can be in anything
204.879,4.5,from computer science econ mathematics
207.099,3.691,physics it really depends on what
209.379,3.78,industry you're going into and what they
210.79,4.65,value but oftentimes those more stem
213.159,3.991,backgrounds are really good for a data
215.44,3.24,scientist now it's not to say that you
217.15,3.329,have to have a master's degree but
218.68,3.6,oftentimes that is a prerequisite for
220.479,2.79,most positions but there are some
222.28,2.76,positions where they're really just
223.269,3.06,looking at experience and your skills to
225.04,2.669,see if you're a good fit and they might
226.329,3.72,take you if you only have a bachelor's
227.709,3.75,degree but again this is a prerequisite
230.049,3.84,for a lot of positions that you'll find
231.459,4.351,on LinkedIn or lost or other job posting
233.889,4.32,websites you need a master's degree just
235.81,3.569,to meet the base requirements and for
238.209,3.06,the data analysts are gonna need a
239.379,3.06,bachelor's or above from most positions
241.269,2.881,and that's going to be in a lot of the
242.439,3.27,same degree fields that a data scientist
244.15,3.989,had which are computer science
245.709,3.75,mathematics economics we don't have to
248.139,3.09,have a bachelor's degree or have a
249.459,4.291,bachelor's degree in those fields you
251.229,4.29,can have no degree and have really good
253.75,3.359,skills and work your way up and you can
255.519,3.511,also have a degree that's completely
257.109,4.35,unrelated but you've made the switch and
259.03,4.29,it is absolutely possible to do that I
261.459,3.761,will say that for qualifications the bar
263.32,3.94,is much lower for a data analyst
265.22,3.57,is a data scientist and you may have a
267.26,3.12,lot better chance of getting your foot
268.79,3.36,in the door as a data analyst than you
270.38,3.3,would if you're trying to actually get a
272.15,3.51,data scientist position right off the
273.68,3.69,bat if you were like in this video be
275.66,4.02,sure to LIKE and subscribe below and now
277.37,3.84,let's look at these skills section so
279.68,3.78,for a data scientist some of the skills
281.21,3.75,that you might need are sequel R and
283.46,3.06,Python and in Python there's a few
284.96,4.41,libraries that really stand out which
286.52,4.83,are pandas numpy scikit-learn and
289.37,4.8,tensorflow then you have things like
291.35,4.59,tableau power bi data visualization
294.17,2.87,tools you may also be working with NLP
295.94,3.15,which is natural language processing
297.04,3.97,which could be structured or
299.09,4.95,unstructured data you may be using
301.01,5.67,apache spark jupiter notebooks pi charms
304.04,4.47,some type of ide and then you may also
306.68,4.86,be using some statistical tool which is
308.51,5.04,SAS or SPSS or any number of other tools
311.54,4.29,that are out there so for a data analyst
313.55,3.57,you may need sequel or in Python and
315.83,3.45,then some libraries for that are gonna
317.12,3.36,be pandas and M PI and matte pot live
319.28,4.29,you'll also need a data visualization
320.48,5.1,tool like tableau or power bi you'll
323.57,4.29,need to be doing data modeling also need
325.58,4.589,a statistical tool like SAS or SPSS or
327.86,4.11,many others you'll be working in Excel a
330.169,3.241,lot and then you'll also probably work
331.97,4.14,in some type of a cloud platform like
333.41,4.5,AWS or Azure now before we get to salary
336.11,3.54,we are looking at salary ranges these
337.91,4.38,are gonna be specific answers for either
339.65,4.53,your location or your industry so if you
342.29,3.3,do want specific answers for either of
344.18,3.75,those things I recommend doing your own
345.59,4.14,research on those but let's get into it
347.93,3.36,let's look at data scientists salaries
349.73,4.17,so for an entry-level position you're
351.29,3.96,looking at around 85 to 95 thousand for
353.9,4.47,a mid-level you're looking at a hundred
355.25,4.38,"to 120,000 and then for a senior level"
358.37,4.32,position you're looking at somewhere
359.63,4.47,around 120 to 150 thousand and for a
362.69,3.24,data analyst for an entry-level position
364.1,4.47,you're looking at around forty five to
365.93,4.62,sixty thousand for mid-level 65 to 85
368.57,5.37,thousand for a senior level position
370.55,5.19,around 85 to 110 thousand now looking at
373.94,3.03,these salaries you might think well Alex
375.74,2.37,I'll just go be a data scientist
376.97,2.91,obviously they make a lot more money
378.11,3.12,I'll just go do that but I want to urge
379.88,3.03,you to really look at these positions
381.23,3.51,and see which one fits your skill sets
382.91,3.9,your education and the kind of work that
384.74,3.0,you want to be doing because I will say
386.81,1.89,that although there are a lot of
387.74,2.76,similarities there's a lot of
388.7,3.3,differences as well I think for a data
390.5,3.78,scientist it takes someone who's very
392.0,4.55,driven to get either a masters or a PhD
394.28,4.67,in a specific degree
396.55,4.08,really pursue machine learning and know
398.95,4.02,how to use those models correctly
400.63,4.05,although a lot of your time is gonna be
402.97,3.36,data cleaning you have to know how to
404.68,3.51,use the models and which models fit and
406.33,3.69,best for your data but if you have those
408.19,3.63,qualifications and you have those skills
410.02,3.36,or you are actively looking to pursue
411.82,3.33,those skills that might be the perfect
413.38,3.45,career for you and it may be a very
415.15,3.48,lucrative career for you especially if
416.83,3.39,you get into the right industry now for
418.63,2.79,a data analyst I think that a lot of
420.22,3.21,people are gonna fit into this category
421.42,4.2,instead of a data scientist category and
423.43,3.99,I think this is for a few reasons one I
425.62,3.27,think it's a little bit easier to learn
427.42,3.9,the skills that you need in order to
428.89,4.29,become a data analyst and two since the
431.32,3.66,qualifications are bachelors are above a
433.18,3.51,lot more people are gonna be included or
434.98,4.08,have the opportunity to become a data
436.69,4.11,analyst overall it really is up to you
439.06,3.15,and which one you prefer I think you
440.8,3.24,should really look at yourself and see
442.21,3.24,what kind of work you enjoy doing I
444.04,3.6,think both of these careers are
445.45,3.45,fantastic options long-term and I don't
447.64,3.39,think these jobs are gonna be going away
448.9,3.69,at all in the near future I think the
451.03,3.33,popularity of these jobs are only gonna
452.59,3.9,increase over the next 10 years so
454.36,3.9,getting started now and knowing what you
456.49,3.99,want to do and just going for it is
458.26,3.63,really the best advice that I have so
460.48,3.09,that's all I got thank you guys so much
461.89,3.18,for watching if you like this video be
