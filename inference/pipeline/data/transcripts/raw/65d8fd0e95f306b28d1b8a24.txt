what's going on everybody welcome back
to another video today we are gonna be
comparing python versus
r we're gonna see which one is better
[Music]
now before i start this presentation yes
i made an entire presentation for this
video
i have to address the elephant in the
room about a month ago i made a somewhat
controversial post
i don't think it's controversial some
people did apparently um and it's right
here hopefully on your screen at this
time all it says is python is better
than r
that's my opinion but it stirred up a
lot of emotions
for a lot of people a lot of people
messaged me commented on it and
apparently a lot of people took offense
to what i said
and they wanted me to explain why i felt
this way
and i did not respond for the pure fact
that it was more fun to watch them argue
and complain rather than answer their
question
but also i knew i was going to be making
this video anyways and so i just figured
they could watch this video whenever i
put it out which uh is right now
and so if you are only on linkedin and
you've never watched my channel before
and you are just seeing for this for the
first time
and you remember that time when i posted
it
i hope this will be clarifying for you
um and so
without further ado let's get into the
presentation
uh and we will start from there all
right so some of the things that we're
going to be discussing today in our
python versus
our presentation is we're going to talk
about descriptions
different libraries the code syntax
pros and cons of both and my final
answer
uh i will say before we get into it i'm
not trying to go super in depth
uh i i tried to make it as user-friendly
as possible if you know you guys are
really wanting a more in-depth
presentation on just one of these i can
absolutely do that i plan on doing that
at some point
but this is going to be kind of high
level and more talking about my thoughts
and my feelings regarding this because
it is a very emotional thing i believe
without further ado let's get into the
description of both again
keeping it more high level and kind of
getting to some specifics
and then my conclusion so let's look at
the description of both python and r
starting with r r is a programming
language developed for statistical
analysis
and the people who mostly used it for a
long long time where statisticians and
just recently within the past you know
five ten years has really been used for
data science and data analysis and
visualizations and all of those things
it was developed in 1993 again like i
just said primarily for statisticians
data miners and analysts
and it's used by a ton of very large
companies some of them are uber
facebook and google but there are tons
of companies and even small companies
that use r and so
if your company does any type of
statistics or statistical analysis
there's a good chance that
your company has either used r in the
past or is currently using r as a
programming language
now onto python python is a general
purpose programming language it's used
for
almost anything you can imagine it may
not be the best thing
for every single thing it can do but it
can do
almost anything and so it's very general
very broad
it is quickly becoming the most popular
programming language in the world
and it is used by companies like google
facebook and netflix now
if you notice in the companies that use
python and are
both facebook and google are on that
list then that wasn't by accident i did
that on purpose
because i wanted to show that these
companies large companies are going to
use
both programming languages for what
they're good for
which obviously we will talk about later
but i wanted to just kind of
put that there for um i guess
foreshadowing
now before we look at libraries and
packages i just want to say
that if i did not highlight your
favorite library or package on here
i am sorry there are so many especially
with r
there's just hundreds and thousands of
different packages and libraries
uh i just can't possibly put them all on
here and so these are just a
highlight of some of the more popular
ones the ones that i have personally
used
and so i hope that you are not offended
by that but let's start with r
for data collection you can use things
like our crawler read excel
read rl and r curl for data wrangling
exploration there's dplyr sql df
data.table read r and tidyr
and for data visualization there's
ggplot2 ggviz plotly squis
and shiny and over to python for a data
collection there's pandas requests and
beautiful soup
for data wrangling and exploration
there's pandas numpy and scipy and for
data visualization
there is matplotlib seaborn and plotly
again this is just a high level overview
of some of the packages in each of these
programming languages
if you have never used r or python i
think these packages are a really good
place to start
now for the code and the syntax on both
of these i tried to stay neutral on this
i tried to just
kind of say what everyone else was
saying because i have my own very strong
thoughts and opinions on this
uh but you know i wanted to stay
somewhat unbiased
at least for this one um but for r
it's easy medium difficulty to pick up
and start working from
from scratch you know if you've never
picked up r it can be
kind of difficult to pick up um a little
bit more advanced
it can be difficult to maintain your
code especially as you start to scale
your code and so that is a big problem
that a lot of people have addressed or
talked about with
r with python again it's easy medium
difficulty to pick up and learn
i i think it can be about the same
difficulty as
r in my opinion and that's what a lot of
people said
and so that's not just my opinion but
it's easier to write and maintain
larger scale code and so as you
start building larger projects or join
larger teams or take on more data it's
just
easier to scale up now into some syntax
examples i 100 cherry pick these
but i do feel like they're pretty
representative of
what the code looks like as a whole and
so
a lot of people are probably gonna get
mad at me saying no r is
much easier than this and you may be
right in some aspects but
for the most part i feel like this is
fairly accurate we're just reading in a
csv file and then trying to find the
mean on
a column or a field and that's about it
and as you can tell
r is just a little bit more difficult a
little bit more complicated
python's a little bit more cleaner it's
a little bit more easy to read
and pick up and that's something that a
lot of people say about python it's very
easily readable
now let's look at some of the pros and
cons of both we're going to be starting
with r
some of the pros are that it is open
source it is fantastic for
statistical analysis has hundreds of
packages and libraries purely for
analytics
and that's what r is it's purely for
statistics
and analyzing data and lastly it is easy
to build visualizations with r
now for the cons it can't be embedded in
web applications and
from what i've read that's purely for
security reasons
and so that is a big downside of using r
you need to know a large amount of
packages and libraries you can't just
know like one or two
kind of like in python you can know
pandas and you can do a lot of different
things with it
r doesn't really have that you have to
know
several things in order to get kind of
one task done
and lastly r can run slow because of how
they store their data
so those are some of the pros and the
cons of r now let's move on to python
some of the pros for python it's open
source
it's easy to read and learn especially
if you're just picking it up for the
first time
it can be embedded into web applications
which can be very important for a lot of
people
and there's a growing number of
libraries for data analysis there
are of course growing number of of
libraries and packages for r as well but
those are quite more well established
while
python is still growing and they're
coming out and they're catching up to r
fairly quickly for the cons the
processing speed
can be slow especially depending on what
library or package you're using
but you know i think that's a con in
both r and python
on some level they're going to run slow
it uses a large amount of memory
kind of part of the why it's running
slow it's simple
to learn um and simple to use and
sometimes that's
an issue actually because it's so simple
when you need to do really complicated
things it can
be kind of hard to do where an r that's
what it's built for it's made for those
complex
calculations and so that's why those
packages and libraries are built the way
they are
and lastly the libraries for all
analytics needs are
still being developed and so yes it is a
pro that
those numbers are growing uh but it's
still a con that they're
you know behind our and so r has more
being developed and more already
developed in terms of
all their libraries and packages being
built out or python it is still growing
now on to my final answer which is
better python or r
it really depends um but going back to
my linkedin post that we talked about
the very beginning
i will say that i still 100 believe that
because to me for my type of work the
stuff that i do
python is 100 times better it's 100
times more useful
and so to me python is better than r but
it really does depend on what you're
using it for
and so if you're doing purely
statistical work r is going to be the
better choice
if you're doing machine learning python
is arguably much better
in my opinion r is harder to learn but
it has more features
while python is easier to learn but
isn't as developed yet
and so what i genuinely think you should
do is i think you should try both i
think you really need to get some
hands-on
experience take a course in both just
see what you think
and and determine for yourself what you
think is better i
really will go back to that linkedin for
a second i believe that for me
personally python is just better i can
use it for so many things it
is in my opinion much better suited
for me and what i do for my job and so
for me
python is way better but for other
positions and other people are maybe
the programming language of choice and
i'm totally okay with that
there were a lot of people in the
comments who were writing
you know it just depends and and you
know why don't you think that
one why do you think that one is better
than the other you know why can't it be
both
and i really wanted to respond and be
like i agree with you uh but i didn't
because again i thought it was more fun
and i knew i was making this video and
so
i i genuinely in the bottom of my heart
to all those people i agree with you
and so i want you to feel some
vindication some sense of
you know you you you were right and so i
hope that
this was um hopefully a good outcome for
what you're hoping for
uh i have nothing against r i have used
it
um and i and i've taken a few courses on
it um
i have not used that much art in my
actual job although the data scientists
that are in my department
use it quite a bit i mostly stick with
python and so again that's why
i like it better but i can honestly say
that i've given both a fair chance and
so
i think that you should do the same i
think you really should test out which
one that you personally think
is better thank you guys so much for
watching i really appreciate it if you
like this video be sure to like and
subscribe i feel like it's worth
subscribing to i got some pretty good
videos i got a lot of videos coming out
soon
thank you for joining me and i will see
you in the next video
[Music]
you
