9.08,5.26,from speech recognition and face
11.7,4.77,recognition to healthcare and marketing
14.34,5.519,neural networks have been used in a
16.47,5.399,varied set of domains hi all I'm Zuleika
19.859,4.611,from Eddy Rica and I welcome you to this
21.869,5.25,session on what is a neural network an
24.47,4.66,artificial neural network is the
27.119,4.951,functional unit of deep learning deep
29.13,5.16,learning uses artificial neural networks
32.07,4.41,which mimic the behavior of the human
34.29,5.339,brain to solve complex data-driven
36.48,5.399,problems now deep learning in itself is
39.629,4.561,a part of machine learning which falls
41.879,5.011,under the larger umbrella of artificial
44.19,4.92,intelligence artificial intelligence
46.89,4.829,machine learning and deep learning are
49.11,4.199,interconnected fields where machine
51.719,4.02,learning and deep learning aids
53.309,5.281,artificial intelligence by providing a
55.739,5.73,set of algorithms and neural networks to
58.59,5.28,solve data-driven problems deep learning
61.469,4.381,makes use of artificial neural networks
63.87,4.65,that behave similar to the neural
65.85,5.37,networks in a brain a neural network
68.52,5.849,functions when some input data is fed to
71.22,5.52,it now this data is then processed wire
74.369,5.101,layers of perceptrons to produce a
76.74,5.55,desired output so let's understand
79.47,4.68,neural networks with a small example now
82.29,4.8,consider a scenario where you have been
84.15,5.009,given a set of labeled images and you
87.09,5.099,have to classify them into two classes
89.159,5.011,one class containing images of non
92.189,5.281,diseased leaves and the other class
94.17,5.04,containing images of diseased leaves so
97.47,4.35,how would you create a neural network
99.21,4.35,that classifies the leaves into diseased
101.82,4.43,and non diseased crops
103.56,5.58,now the process always begins with
106.25,4.869,processing and transforming the input in
109.14,5.549,such a way that it can be easily
111.119,5.491,processed in our case each leaf image
114.689,4.651,will be broken down into pixels
116.61,5.549,depending on the dimension of the image
119.34,5.34,for example if the image is composed of
122.159,5.761,30 by 30 pixels then the total number of
124.68,5.85,pixels will be 900 now these pixels are
127.92,5.03,represented as matrices which are then
130.53,5.0,fed into the input layer of the neural
132.95,5.1,network just like how our brains have
135.53,4.95,neurons that help in building and
138.05,5.189,connecting thoughts an artificial neural
140.48,5.399,network has perceptrons that accept
143.239,4.741,inputs and process them by passing them
145.879,5.521,on from the input layer to the hidden
147.98,5.94,and finally the output layer now as the
151.4,4.68,input is passed from the input layer to
153.92,5.64,the hidden layer an initial random
156.08,5.58,weight is assigned to each input the
159.56,4.38,inputs are then multiplied with their
161.66,4.409,corresponding weights and their sum is
163.94,4.95,further processed through the network
166.069,5.491,now here what you do is you assign a
168.89,5.79,numerical value called bias to each
171.56,4.95,perceptron furthermore each perceptron
174.68,3.779,is passed through activation or
176.51,4.259,something known as a transformation
178.459,4.981,function that determines whether a
180.769,5.611,particular perceptron gets activated or
183.44,5.519,not an activated perceptron is used to
186.38,4.8,transmit data to the next layer in this
188.959,4.14,manner the data is propagated forward
191.18,5.01,through the neural network until the
193.099,5.22,perceptron reach the output layer at the
196.19,4.41,output layer a probability is derived
198.319,5.851,which decides whether the data belongs
200.6,5.94,to Class A or Class B now let's assume a
204.17,5.46,case where the predicted output is wrong
206.54,5.13,in such a situation we train the neural
209.63,4.949,network by using the back propagation
211.67,5.37,method initially while designing the
214.579,5.641,neural network we initialize weights to
217.04,5.4,each input with some random values now
220.22,4.95,these waves denote the importance of
222.44,5.31,each input variable therefore if we
225.17,5.52,propagate backward in a neural network
227.75,5.76,and compare the actual output to the
230.69,5.49,predicted output we can readjust the
233.51,5.879,weights of each input in such a way that
236.18,5.55,the error is minimized this results in a
239.389,5.491,more accurate output and this is exactly
241.73,5.52,what back propagation means now let's
244.88,4.74,discuss a few real-world applications of
247.25,4.859,neural networks with the help of deep
249.62,4.709,learning techniques Google can instantly
252.109,4.711,translate between more than hundred
254.329,4.261,different human languages visual
256.82,4.05,translation is an interesting
258.59,4.38,application of deep learning it can be
260.87,4.74,used to identify images that have
262.97,4.15,letters now once you identify them they
265.61,3.64,can be turned into
267.12,5.22,translated and then the images are
269.25,5.28,recreated with a translated text in fact
272.34,4.83,google has an app for this purpose it's
274.53,4.29,called the Google Translate app let's
277.17,4.17,not forget to mention automated
278.82,4.5,self-driven cars deep learning has
281.34,5.25,played a huge role in the field of
283.32,5.7,self-driving cars from Tesla to Google
286.59,4.65,owned way more self-driving cars are
289.02,4.74,being perfected with the help of neural
291.24,4.83,networks then of course we have the
293.76,4.92,virtual assistants like Siri Alexa
296.07,5.49,Cortana that can literally read your
298.68,5.34,mind these assistants are purely based
301.56,4.29,on technologies including deep learning
304.02,2.79,machine learning and natural language
305.85,3.39,processing
306.81,5.67,apart from this deep learning has also
309.24,5.49,made its way into the gaming industry so
312.48,5.01,all your dota fans out there might have
314.73,5.64,already heard of the famous open AI 5
317.49,5.67,which is the first AI to beat the world
320.37,4.92,champions in an eSports game after
323.16,5.19,defeating the reigning dota 2 world
325.29,6.96,champions post the victory Bill Gates
328.35,7.11,tweeted quote AI bots just beat humans
332.25,5.16,at the video game dota 2 that's a big
335.46,4.74,deal because their victory required
337.41,4.83,teamwork and collaboration a huge
340.2,4.71,milestone in advancing artificial
342.24,4.38,intelligence now guys the applications
344.91,4.02,of deep learning are not restricted to
346.62,4.38,just games and machine translation in
348.93,4.41,fact deep learning has found its way
351.0,5.58,into the creative arts and music field
353.34,6.12,an AI base system called muse net can
356.58,4.8,now compose classical music that echoes
359.46,5.61,the classical legends like batch and
361.38,5.6,Mozart muse net is a deep neural network
365.07,5.07,that is capable of generating
366.98,5.44,four-minute musical compositions with 10
370.14,5.07,different instruments and can combine
372.42,5.31,styles from country to Mozart and to the
375.21,4.68,Beatles another creative product of
377.73,4.19,artificial intelligence is a Content
379.89,3.96,automation tool called wordsmith
381.92,4.69,wordsmith is a natural language
383.85,4.98,generation platform that can transform
386.61,4.86,your data into insightful narratives
388.83,5.04,take giants such as Yahoo Microsoft
391.47,5.82,tableau are using words meant to
393.87,6.539,generate around 1.5 billion pieces of
397.29,4.769,content every day I can go on an
400.409,4.26,one about the applications of deep
402.059,5.28,learning in the long term we are hoping
404.669,4.86,to see the use of advanced AI techniques
407.339,5.31,like deep learning for the betterment of
409.529,5.94,humanity irrespective of the threat AI
412.649,5.28,is supposedly going to pose on humans
415.469,5.28,I'm a firm believer that AI will only
417.929,3.96,benefit us in the long run let me know
420.749,4.35,your thoughts in the comment section
421.889,4.98,until next time happy learning I hope
