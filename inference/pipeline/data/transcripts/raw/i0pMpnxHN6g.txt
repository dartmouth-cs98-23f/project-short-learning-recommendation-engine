0.0,5.25,hello everyone and welcome back to AWS
2.939,4.801,simplified today I want to talk to you
5.25,4.679,about software architecture diagrams and
7.74,4.019,some tools you can use to make your life
9.929,3.54,a little easier when you need to create
11.759,3.931,them so if you're a developer an
13.469,4.171,engineer or a solution architect it's
15.69,4.47,absolutely critical that you use
17.64,4.62,architecture diagrams to convey how a
20.16,4.52,system works so there's a lot of options
22.26,4.83,out there ranging from Microsoft Visio
24.68,4.33,OmniGraffle lucidchart
27.09,3.63,and I'm sure many many others that I
29.01,3.42,probably haven't heard of so I've tried
30.72,3.69,a handful of these in the past but what
32.43,4.59,I was really looking for was something
34.41,5.309,that was free easy to use could sync
37.02,5.789,across devices supported collaboration
39.719,5.041,and natively had access to AWS icon
42.809,4.261,packs and if you know anything about me
44.76,4.44,I'm constantly using AWS technologies
47.07,3.989,putting together AWS architecture
49.2,3.929,diagrams so I don't want to go and hunt
51.059,4.531,down icon packs to use them with
53.129,4.41,whatever software I'm using so as of now
55.59,4.199,I've only found one that I was happy
57.539,4.29,with that satisfied these criteria and
59.789,5.881,that is what I'm currently showing you
61.829,6.241,now and it's called draw IO so drop at
65.67,4.379,IO is pretty straightforward to use it
68.07,4.74,supports all your basic shapes arrows
70.049,5.101,layers connections text boxes and on and
72.81,4.08,on and on so my absolute favorite part
75.15,4.109,of this tool is that it's available in
76.89,4.29,any browser and does not require a local
79.259,3.661,installation so that means you can
81.18,4.259,access it from literally anything that
82.92,5.28,can run Chrome Firefox or any other
85.439,4.801,Internet browser some of the nice
88.2,4.14,features that are particularly important
90.24,4.47,to me is the fact that by default that
92.34,4.889,gives you access to AWS service icons
94.71,4.409,right out of the box so no more hunting
97.229,3.301,down icon packs and installing them on
99.119,3.721,your local machine they'll all be there
100.53,4.17,for you automatically another nice thing
102.84,3.63,about it is that it allows you to select
104.7,4.83,from a vast amount of templates
106.47,6.3,including flow diagrams UML diagrams
109.53,5.549,Gantt charts Venn diagrams and many many
112.77,4.32,more so as we can see here on the
115.079,3.9,website as I'm scrolling down they
117.09,3.779,provide you with a ton of examples and
118.979,3.93,depending on your artistic or design
120.869,3.96,abilities your results may come out
122.909,4.231,looking better or worse than what they
124.829,4.32,have on display here so here I am
127.14,4.95,putting together an architecture diagram
129.149,4.92,for a pet project using the draw die
132.09,3.929,tool so clearly I don't have the
134.069,3.931,artistic touch so my diagram looks a
136.019,3.931,little basic but with some extra effort
138.0,4.019,you can make it look just as appealing
139.95,5.1,as some of the examples on the draw de
142.019,4.771,IO website so I'm making use of the AWS
145.05,4.019,icon packs here and that comes by
146.79,3.99,default as I've mentioned previously so
149.069,4.351,if you're looking for an architecture or
150.78,5.489,flow diagram software that's free easy
153.42,4.8,to use and supports collaboration Trotta
156.269,4.351,io is definitely something that you
158.22,3.989,should check out so I hope you enjoyed
160.62,3.149,today's video and if you did make sure
