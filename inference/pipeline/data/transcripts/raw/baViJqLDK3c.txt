2.04,6.0,what on Earth is a quantum computer it's
5.04,4.86,qubit try all the codes at once
8.04,3.66,whichever Nation first developed a
9.9,4.619,practical quantum computer will have a
11.7,5.04,tremendous Advantage Quantum Supremacy
14.519,4.741,imagine a world where unsolvable
16.74,4.619,problems are solved in seconds where
19.26,4.32,complex calculations that would take us
21.359,4.621,supercomputer years to compute are done
23.58,4.619,in a blink of an eye welcome to the
25.98,4.44,Future a future powered by Quantum
28.199,4.56,Computing and artificial intelligence
30.42,5.22,this is not just a technological
32.759,5.221,Revolution it's a Quantum Leap into a
35.64,3.78,new era of human Innovation here is
37.98,5.099,everything you need to know about
39.42,6.84,Quantum Computing and AI what is quantum
43.079,5.541,Computing in simple terms Quantum
46.26,4.319,Computing is an area of computer science
48.62,4.06,focused on the development of
50.579,4.8,Technologies based on the principles of
52.68,4.859,quantum theory Quantum Computing uses
55.379,4.2,the unique behaviors of quantum physics
57.539,4.02,to solve problems that are too complex
59.579,5.04,for classical computing
61.559,6.721,let's play a game I want you to imagine
64.619,6.54,a coin in the classical world this coin
68.28,4.74,can either be heads or tails but what if
71.159,3.841,I told you there's a universe where this
73.02,4.38,coin could be both heads and tails at
75.0,5.939,the same time welcome to the world of
77.4,6.06,quantum Computing in this realm our coin
80.939,5.341,is a qubit the fundamental unit of
83.46,5.64,quantum information unlike the bit in
86.28,5.82,classical Computing which can be a zero
89.1,6.059,or a one a cubit can exist in a state
92.1,5.519,that is a superposition of both thanks
95.159,5.761,to a Quantum Quirk called superposition
97.619,6.721,it's like Schrodinger's cat both alive
100.92,6.059,and dead until observed now imagine a
104.34,5.459,hundred coins or qubits each
106.979,4.381,representing multiple States at once the
109.799,4.561,number of possibilities grows
111.36,5.759,exponentially not linearly like in
114.36,5.28,classical Computing that's the raw
117.119,5.101,mind-boggling power of quantum Computing
119.64,5.4,but you might be thinking
122.22,4.56,that's great in theory but how does it
125.04,5.279,translate to the real world
126.78,6.12,well consider this today's encryption
130.319,4.981,systems the ones that secure your online
132.9,4.979,transactions are based on complex
135.3,4.98,mathematical problems that even the
137.879,3.601,fastest supercomputers can't crack in a
140.28,3.599,reasonable time
141.48,5.7,but a sufficiently powerful quantum
143.879,5.22,computer could scary isn't it we're not
147.18,4.5,just talking about faster computers
149.099,4.621,we're talking about a paradigm shift in
151.68,4.139,computational power that could unlock
153.72,4.98,answers to questions we haven't even
155.819,5.401,thought of asking Quantum Computing
158.7,5.64,versus classical computing
161.22,5.94,cure yourself in a grand Music Hall on
164.34,5.82,stage a lone pianist plays a captivating
167.16,5.579,Melody on a traditional piano each note
170.16,5.28,resonating beautifully that pianist
172.739,4.981,represents classical Computing where
175.44,3.72,each key pressed can only produce one
177.72,3.42,note at a time
179.16,3.359,but what if I told you there's an
181.14,3.599,instrument that could play multiple
182.519,5.58,notes simultaneously with just one key
184.739,5.461,enter the world of quantum Computing in
188.099,4.5,this analogy the quantum computer is
190.2,5.22,like a futuristic piano with keys that
192.599,5.581,play not just one but several notes at
195.42,5.22,the same time it harnesses The Peculiar
198.18,4.979,properties of quantum mechanics like
200.64,4.26,superposition and entanglement to
203.159,4.141,process information in ways the
204.9,4.14,classical computers simply cannot but
207.3,4.92,what does that mean for us in Practical
209.04,5.699,terms consider a maze the classical
212.22,5.7,computer would methodically explore each
214.739,6.06,path one at a time taking ages to find
217.92,5.539,the exit a quantum computer on the other
220.799,5.401,hand could explore all paths
223.459,5.081,simultaneously reaching the exit in a
226.2,4.319,fraction of the time this ability to
228.54,4.44,perform parallel computations gives
230.519,4.261,quantum computers an edge over their
232.98,4.619,classical counterparts in solving
234.78,5.7,complex problems what can a quantum
237.599,5.581,computer really do imagine you are a
240.48,5.16,painter but instead of having only three
243.18,5.639,primary colors to mix and create your
245.64,5.099,palette you have a million the array of
248.819,5.221,colors you could create would be nearly
250.739,5.4,infinite right that in essence is what a
254.04,3.18,quantum computer brings to the world of
256.139,3.361,computing
257.22,4.44,and ability to process an enormous
259.5,4.5,amount of information simultaneously
261.66,5.039,creating a vast landscape of
264.0,4.979,possibilities let's dig deeper into the
266.699,4.681,potential of quantum computers picture
268.979,5.101,the most complex mathematical problems
271.38,5.28,or simulations of molecular interactions
274.08,5.52,for drug Discovery or even predictions
276.66,4.979,about global climate changes these tasks
279.6,4.44,which could take classical computers
281.639,4.201,millions of years to complete could
284.04,4.26,potentially be solved by quantum
285.84,4.62,computers in near seconds a case in
288.3,6.119,point is Google's Quantum Supremacy
290.46,7.14,experiment in 2019 Google's 54 Cubit
294.419,6.601,quantum computer Sycamore accomplished a
297.6,5.76,task in just 200 seconds a task that the
301.02,4.32,world's fastest classical supercomputer
303.36,4.32,would take approximately ten thousand
305.34,4.2,years to complete that's like comparing
307.68,2.64,the speed of a snail to the speed of
309.54,3.9,light
310.32,5.34,but it's not just about speed quantum
313.44,4.68,computers can help us discover new ways
315.66,4.259,of doing things for instance they can
318.12,4.139,help us develop new materials and
319.919,4.861,medicines by accurately simulating their
322.259,5.401,behavior at a molecular level a feat
324.78,4.8,impossible for classical computers they
327.66,3.96,could revolutionize Industries like
329.58,4.08,cryptography making our online
331.62,4.68,transactions more secure than ever
333.66,4.379,before they could even find new more
336.3,4.56,efficient solutions to logistical
338.039,6.0,challenges such as optimizing delivery
340.86,5.94,routes or Supply chains so what can a
344.039,5.94,quantum computer really do the better
346.8,5.22,question might be what can it do we're
349.979,3.241,only scratching the surface of its
352.02,4.5,potential
353.22,4.919,Quantum machine learning a new paradigm
356.52,4.2,in AI
358.139,5.28,imagine you're a musician and you've
360.72,4.8,been gifted a brand new instrument one
363.419,4.981,that's so unique it could potentially
365.52,6.119,revolutionize music but there's a catch
368.4,5.16,you need to learn how to play it that's
371.639,4.441,the situation we're in today with
373.56,4.859,Quantum Computing we have this powerful
376.08,4.2,new tool but we're still figuring out
378.419,3.72,how to use it effectively
380.28,6.359,and that's where Quantum machine
382.139,6.601,learning or qno comes in qno is like the
386.639,4.62,Maestro that knows exactly how to play
388.74,4.26,this new instrument producing Symphonies
391.259,4.201,of solutions that were previously
393.0,4.08,impossible traditional machine learning
395.46,5.1,is limited by the computational
397.08,5.459,resources of classical computers but qnl
400.56,3.96,leverages the superposition and
402.539,3.861,entanglement of quantum mechanics to
404.52,4.619,process vast amounts of information
406.4,6.16,simultaneously let's take a trip to a
409.139,5.34,city any City now imagine you're tasked
412.56,3.18,with predicting the traffic flow for the
414.479,3.361,next month
415.74,4.5,that's a massive amount of data and
417.84,4.44,variables to consider classical machine
420.24,5.64,learning would struggle with such a task
422.28,5.639,but qnl thrives in it it could process
425.88,4.02,and analyze all the data at once
427.919,4.741,predicting traffic patterns with
429.9,5.46,astonishing accuracy but it's not just
432.66,5.34,about predictions Hue and L can also
435.36,4.5,accelerate the learning process A's
438.0,4.139,could be trained to recognize patterns
439.86,5.88,and make decisions faster than ever
442.139,5.28,before in fields like healthcare Q manl
445.74,3.78,could accelerate the development of
447.419,4.62,personalized treatments by rapidly
449.52,5.34,analyzing an individual's unique genetic
452.039,4.38,makeup real-world applications of
454.86,4.44,quantum AI
456.419,5.701,let's dive into five areas where Quantum
459.3,5.7,AI is making its Mark today drug
462.12,4.74,Discovery imagine finding a cure for a
465.0,4.44,disease in a fraction of the time it
466.86,5.459,usually takes by accurately modeling
469.44,5.24,molecular interactions Quantum a I can
472.319,5.641,accelerate the discovery of new drugs
474.68,5.5,pharmaceutical companies like Biogen are
477.96,4.2,already exploring these capabilities to
480.18,3.359,tackle diseases like Alzheimer's and
482.16,4.259,Parkinson's
483.539,4.921,Financial Services in the world of
486.419,4.68,Finance precision and speed are

491.099,5.22,optimize trading strategies improve
493.86,5.279,fraud detection and enhance risk
496.319,5.82,management major Banks like Barclays and
499.139,5.221,JP Morgan are already exploring Quantum
502.139,3.361,Computing to gain an edge in the
504.36,4.019,financial Market
505.5,5.22,climate modeling Quantum AI could help
508.379,4.621,us navigate the climate crisis by
510.72,4.8,creating highly accurate climate models
513.0,4.86,these models can help us understand the
515.52,4.74,impacts of climate change and develop
517.86,5.28,strategies to mitigate them companies
520.26,4.26,like IBM are already leveraging Quantum
523.14,4.28,Computing for environmental
524.52,5.7,sustainability supply chain optimization
527.42,5.44,Quantum a I could optimize complex

548.58,5.819,sophisticated Quantum AI offers new
551.339,4.801,tools for defense Quantum algorithms can
554.399,4.201,help develop virtually unbreakable
556.14,5.4,encryption ensuring our Digital World
558.6,5.1,remains secure companies like Microsoft
561.54,4.44,and Google are investing heavily in
563.7,4.74,Quantum Computing researched to shake
565.98,4.68,the future of cyber security
568.44,5.339,Quantum ai's potential to solve
570.66,5.82,previously unsolvable problems Quantum
573.779,4.981,AI is like a master key crafted to
576.48,4.62,unlock doors the have remained sealed
578.76,4.62,for ages let's peer through three such
581.1,4.919,doors into problems that classical
583.38,6.899,Computing has struggled to solve but
586.019,5.401,Quantum AI might conquer one protein
590.279,3.781,folding
591.42,4.62,understanding how proteins the building
594.06,4.32,blocks of life fold into
596.04,5.16,three-dimensional shapes is a problem of
598.38,5.04,monumental complexity misfolded proteins
601.2,4.56,are linked to diseases like Alzheimer's
603.42,4.74,and Parkinson's a classical computer
605.76,4.32,would require more time than the age of
608.16,3.66,the universe to simulate these folding
610.08,5.16,Pathways accurately
611.82,5.459,however a quantum computer with its
615.24,4.92,ability to handle vast amounts of data
617.279,5.521,simultaneously could potentially unravel
620.16,5.16,the mystery of protein folding Paving
622.8,5.76,the way for novel treatments and cures
625.32,5.699,two optimization problems
628.56,4.8,consider the famous traveling salesman
631.019,4.44,problem where the task is to find the
633.36,3.96,shortest route that visits a set of
635.459,4.861,cities and returns to the starting point
637.32,5.28,as the number of cities increases the
640.32,5.699,problem becomes exponentially harder for
642.6,5.76,classical computers Quantum AI with its
646.019,4.32,capacity for parallel processing could
648.36,4.74,find the optimal solution in a fraction
650.339,5.821,of the time revolutionizing Fields like
653.1,6.359,Logistics Supply Chain management and
656.16,5.64,even space exploration three prime
659.459,4.62,factorization breaking down large
661.8,4.56,numbers into their prime factors is a
664.079,3.961,task that's easy for humans when the
666.36,3.659,numbers are small but virtually
668.04,4.02,impossible for even the fastest
670.019,3.301,classical computers when the numbers get
672.06,3.899,large
673.32,5.18,this is the basis of RSA encryption
675.959,5.461,which secures our online Communications
678.5,5.8,a sufficiently powerful quantum computer
681.42,4.32,running Shores algorithm however could
684.3,3.96,factorize these large numbers
685.74,4.68,efficiently shaking the very foundations
688.26,4.44,of modern cryptography
690.42,4.44,these are just a few examples of the
692.7,5.22,previously unsolvable problems that
694.86,5.7,Quantum a if I could conquer Quantum AI
697.92,5.28,holds the potential to not only solve
700.56,5.7,these problems but also to uncover new
703.2,6.18,questions new Mysteries and New Horizons
706.26,7.86,of understanding the future of quantum
709.38,7.92,AI Utopia or dystopia consider this just
714.12,5.279,a few decades ago the idea of having a
717.3,5.34,personal computer at home was considered
719.399,5.281,futuristic now we carry computers in our
722.64,4.56,pockets that are millions of times more
724.68,5.279,powerful the trajectory of technology
727.2,5.579,has always been exponential and with
729.959,5.161,Quantum AI we're about to hit the Steep
732.779,4.5,part of the curve what we thought might
735.12,5.52,take a decade could now be realized in
737.279,5.881,mere months on the utopian side Quantum
740.64,5.34,AI promises to solve problems that have
743.16,4.88,baffled Humanity for centuries it could
745.98,4.74,lead to breakthroughs in medicine
748.04,5.02,environmental sustainability and even
750.72,4.14,our understanding of the universe it
753.06,5.399,could make our world safer more
754.86,6.06,efficient and more connected however as
758.459,5.101,with any powerful tool it also comes
760.92,5.039,with risks quantum computers could crack
763.56,5.339,current encryption methods threatening
765.959,5.521,online security The Accelerated pace of
768.899,5.161,AI could outstrip our ability to
771.48,4.44,understand and control it leading to
774.06,3.899,unpredictable outcomes
775.92,4.44,and there's the ever-present concern
777.959,5.401,about Job displacement and societal
780.36,6.659,disruption so is the future of quantum
783.36,5.4,AI a Utopia or dystopia the truth is
787.019,4.081,it's up to us
788.76,5.519,the power of quantum a i is not
791.1,6.0,inherently good or bad it's a tool and
794.279,5.461,like any tool its impact depends on how
797.1,4.979,we use it we must navigate this Brave
799.74,4.92,New World with caution harnessing the
802.079,4.741,benefits while mitigating the risks if
