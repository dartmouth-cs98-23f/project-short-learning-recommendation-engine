10.429,6.1,computer graphics are pictures and films
13.23,5.82,created using computers usually the term
16.529,4.5,refers to computer-generated image data
19.05,5.19,created with help of specialized
21.029,5.461,graphical hardware and software it is a
24.24,4.68,vast and recently developed area of
26.49,5.94,computer science the phrase was coined
28.92,5.85,in 1960 by computer graphics researchers
32.43,5.64,Verne Hudson and William Feder of Boeing
34.77,5.43,it is often abbreviated as CG though
38.07,5.489,sometimes erroneously referred to as
40.2,5.429,computer-generated imagery some topics
43.559,4.891,in computer graphics include user
45.629,6.481,interface design sprite graphics vector
48.45,6.48,graphics 3d modeling shaders GPU design
52.11,5.42,implicit surface visualization with ray
54.93,5.699,tracing and computer vision among others
57.53,5.89,the overall methodology depends heavily
60.629,6.42,on the underlying sciences of geometry
63.42,5.34,optics and physics computer graphics is
67.049,3.811,responsible for displaying
68.76,4.95,art and image data effectively and
70.86,5.52,meaningfully to the consumer it is also
73.71,5.339,used for processing image data received
76.38,4.32,from the physical world computer
79.049,3.96,graphics development has had a
80.7,4.739,significant impact on many types of
83.009,5.22,media and has revolutionized animation
85.439,6.441,movies advertising video games and
88.229,3.651,graphic design in general
