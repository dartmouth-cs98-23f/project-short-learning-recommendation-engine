8.559,4.641,hey everyone welcome to this week's live
10.8,4.799,session today's topic is top 10 data
13.2,4.32,analysis tools but before we begin i'd
15.599,3.921,like to thank our viewers on youtube and
17.52,3.679,facebook for actively participating in
19.52,3.599,these sessions
21.199,5.24,so let's wait for a while for people to
23.119,3.32,tune in
34.399,3.68,if you have any questions do feel free
36.32,4.239,to leave them in our chat section and we
38.079,4.32,will be happy to answer them also make
40.559,4.961,sure to subscribe to our channel and hit
42.399,6.081,the bell icon to never miss an update
45.52,4.96,now let's get started
48.48,4.0,before i start off with the top 10 data
50.48,4.719,analysis tools i'd like to talk a bit
52.48,4.64,about data analysis
55.199,4.321,so have you ever wondered why data
57.12,4.32,analysis is important
59.52,4.16,there are zillions of companies across
61.44,4.56,the world all these companies generate a
63.68,4.56,lot of data they literally work with
66.0,4.4,this generated data
68.24,4.239,these companies depend on data to make
70.4,3.92,crucial decisions which can impact their
72.479,3.761,businesses
74.32,3.92,data in its raw format has to be
76.24,6.4,converted into meaningful information
78.24,4.4,which can then be used by organizations
83.68,5.439,this is done by analyzing the generated
86.08,6.079,data and for this we have data analysis
89.119,5.521,so what is data analysis
92.159,4.96,data analysis is not just a single step
94.64,4.88,but a set of processes it is the process
97.119,4.401,of collecting data then cleaning it when
99.52,4.639,i say cleaning it simply means removing
101.52,4.32,the irrelevant data and then this data
104.159,3.201,is transformed into meaningful
105.84,3.52,information
107.36,4.32,we can simply relate this process to how
109.36,4.24,you make a jigsaw puzzle just like how
111.68,3.68,you gather all the pieces together and
113.6,3.44,fit them accordingly to bring out a
115.36,3.759,beautiful picture
117.04,4.32,data analysis also works on almost the
119.119,4.561,same grounds
121.36,5.039,to achieve the goals of data analysis we
123.68,5.12,use a number of data analysis tools
126.399,4.64,companies rely on these tools to gather
128.8,4.64,and transform their data into meaningful
131.039,4.56,insights so which tool should you choose
133.44,3.76,to analyze your data which tool should
135.599,3.841,you learn if you want to make a career
137.2,3.6,in this field we will answer that in
139.44,3.519,this session
140.8,4.64,after extensive research we have come up
142.959,4.401,with these top 10 data analysis tools
145.44,3.68,here we will look at the features of
147.36,5.519,each of these tools and the companies
149.12,3.759,using them so let's start
154.84,6.039,off at number 10 we have microsoft excel
158.879,4.801,all of us would have used microsoft
160.879,4.72,excel at some point right it is easy to
163.68,3.04,use and one of the best tools for data
165.599,2.961,analysis
166.72,4.239,developed by microsoft excel is
168.56,4.56,basically a spreadsheet program using
170.959,4.56,excel you can create grids of numbers
173.12,4.56,text and formulae it is one of the
175.519,4.321,widely used tools be it in a small or
177.68,4.4,large setup
179.84,5.56,the interface of microsoft excel looks
182.08,3.32,like this
186.319,4.0,let's now move on to the features of
188.08,4.56,excel
190.319,4.64,firstly excel works with almost every
192.64,4.16,other piece of software in office we can
194.959,3.841,easily add excel spreadsheets to word
196.8,3.76,documents and powerpoint presentations
198.8,5.28,to create more visually appealing
200.56,3.52,reports or presentations
204.4,3.919,the windows version of excel supports
206.4,5.119,programming through microsoft's visual
208.319,5.361,basic for applications vba
211.519,4.0,programming with vba allows spreadsheet
213.68,4.32,manipulation that is difficult with
215.519,4.321,standard spreadsheet techniques
218.0,3.84,in addition to this the user can
219.84,5.039,automate tasks such as formatting or
221.84,5.039,date organization in vba
224.879,4.241,one of the biggest benefits of excel is
226.879,4.64,its ability to organize large amounts of
229.12,3.759,data into orderly logical spreadsheets
231.519,3.601,and charts
232.879,4.241,by doing so it's a lot easier to analyze
235.12,4.64,data especially while creating graphs
237.12,4.8,and other visual data representations
239.76,5.199,the visualization can be generated from
241.92,4.399,specified group of cells
244.959,3.441,those were few of the features of
246.319,3.761,microsoft excel

602.959,7.681,using sas we have companies like genpak
606.0,7.12,iqea accenture and ibm to name a few
610.64,4.48,that was all about sas
613.12,4.0,so for all those who joined in late let
615.12,4.8,me just quickly repeat our list at
617.12,5.2,number 10 we have microsoft excel then
619.92,5.28,at number nine we have rapidminer at
622.32,5.84,number eight we have talent at number
625.2,4.079,seven we have nine and at number six we
628.16,3.28,have sas
629.279,4.401,so far do you all agree with this list
631.44,4.32,let us know in the comment section below
633.68,4.64,let's now move on to the next five tools
635.76,2.56,in our list
641.92,4.96,so at number five we have both r and
644.24,5.44,python yes we have two of them in the
646.88,2.8,fifth position
650.72,3.84,r is a programming language which is
652.56,4.24,used for analysis as well it has
654.56,3.36,traditionally been used in academics and
656.8,2.8,research
657.92,3.359,python is a high level programming
659.6,3.919,language which has a python data
661.279,4.0,analysis library it is used for
663.519,3.521,everything starting from importing data
665.279,4.8,from excel spreadsheets to processing
667.04,3.039,them for analysis
671.04,5.76,this is the interface of r
674.959,4.88,next up is the interface of the python
676.8,3.039,jupiter notebook
682.32,3.92,let's now move on to the features of
683.92,4.32,both r and python
686.24,4.56,when it comes to the availability of r
688.24,4.8,and python it is very easy both r and
690.8,5.039,python are completely free hence it can
693.04,4.88,be used without any license
695.839,4.24,r used to compute everything in memory
697.92,4.56,and hence the computations were limited
700.079,4.0,but now it has changed both are in
702.48,3.52,python have options for parallel
704.079,4.721,computations and good data handling
706.0,2.8,capabilities
708.88,4.24,as mentioned earlier as both r and
711.04,6.799,python are open in nature all the latest
713.12,4.719,features are available without any delay
719.2,6.079,moving on to the companies using r we
721.44,6.32,have uber google facebook to name a few
725.279,5.281,python is used by many companies again
727.76,4.639,to name a few we have amazon google and
730.56,4.48,the american photo and video sharing
732.399,7.081,social networking service instagram
735.04,4.44,that was all about rn python
744.24,5.92,at number 4 we have apache spark
748.0,4.0,apache spark is an open source engine
750.16,3.52,developed specifically for handling
752.0,3.839,large-scale data processing and
753.68,4.64,analytics
755.839,5.041,spark offers the ability to access data
758.32,5.519,in a variety of sources including hadoop
760.88,4.0,distributed file system htfs openstack
763.839,4.0,swift
764.88,5.28,amazon s3 and cassandra
767.839,4.56,it allows you to store and process data
770.16,4.32,in real time across various clusters of
772.399,3.761,computers using simple programming
774.48,3.84,constructs
776.16,4.08,apache spark is designed to accelerate
778.32,4.16,analytics on hadoop while providing a

782.48,4.08,that include a fully featured machine
784.399,5.12,learning library a graph processing
786.56,4.959,engine and stream processing
789.519,4.961,so this is how the interface of apache
791.519,2.961,spark looks like
797.6,4.239,now let's look at the important features
799.36,4.88,of apache spark
801.839,4.161,spark stores data in the ram hence it
804.24,4.399,can access the data quickly and
806.0,4.639,accelerate the speed of analytics spark
808.639,4.481,helps to run an application in a hadoop
810.639,6.64,cluster up to 100 times faster in memory
813.12,4.159,and 10 times faster when running on disk
817.519,3.201,it supports multiple languages and
819.36,4.719,allows the developers to write
820.72,5.359,applications in java scala r or python
824.079,4.56,spark comes up with 80 high level
826.079,4.721,operators for interactive querying spark
828.639,4.64,code for batch processing joins stream
830.8,5.839,against historical data or run ad hoc
833.279,3.36,queries on stream state
836.8,4.159,analytics can be performed better as
838.639,4.32,spark has a rich set of sql queries
840.959,4.961,machine learning algorithms complex
842.959,5.841,analytics etc apache spark provides
845.92,5.12,fault tolerance through spark rdd spark
848.8,4.399,resilient distributed data sets are
851.04,4.479,designed to handle the failure of any
853.199,4.721,worker node in the cluster thus it
855.519,4.801,ensures that the loss of data reduces to
857.92,2.4,zero
860.72,5.52,conviva netflix iqea lockheed martin and
864.399,6.281,ebay are some of the companies that use
866.24,4.44,apache spark on a daily basis
870.72,3.6,at number three we have another
872.48,4.88,important growing data analysis tool
874.32,3.04,that is click view

1276.559,4.561,recap quickly in the meanwhile y'all can
1279.44,4.479,post your questions in the comment
1281.12,2.799,section below
1289.6,6.559,so at number 10 we have microsoft excel
1293.039,6.081,then at number nine we have rapidminer
1296.159,6.681,at number eight we have talent at number
1299.12,7.52,seven we have nine at number six we have
1302.84,5.8,sas r and python at number five apache
1306.64,4.159,spark at number four
1308.64,5.2,click view at number three
1310.799,4.961,power bi at number two and finally we
1313.84,4.92,have tableau topping the list at number
1315.76,3.0,one
1319.12,4.48,okay so now let's get to the q a session
1321.679,4.081,i can see there are a lot of questions
1323.6,5.28,from our viewers let me go ahead and
1325.76,3.12,address a few of them
1331.039,4.481,so the first question is which
1333.039,4.161,industries are using sas and has sas
1335.52,5.36,become a declining tool since the
1337.2,3.68,emergence of r and python
1341.84,4.16,well sas is used in different domains of
1344.0,6.24,banking industry like risk analytics
1346.0,4.24,marketing analytics and h analytics
1350.559,4.081,sas is majorly used in the healthcare
1352.559,3.681,sector for clinical research and drug
1354.64,3.84,development
1356.24,4.64,sas offers a wide variety of packages
1358.48,5.6,for advanced level analytics like sas
1360.88,4.88,iml which is similar to r sas e minor
1364.08,4.079,among others
1365.76,4.88,of course companies have started using r
1368.159,4.321,and python for data analysis but sas is
1370.64,3.919,still relevant and remains a leader in
1372.48,4.48,almost every sector of business
1374.559,6.401,usually small companies and startups use
1376.96,4.0,r and python as it's free of cost
1383.52,4.0,another question i see on the screen is
1385.6,3.84,i am a fresher which tool would you
1387.52,3.92,recommend me to learn qlikview or
1389.44,4.0,tableau
1391.44,4.4,honestly you can choose any of the two
1393.44,4.4,tools both the tools have a high demand
1395.84,3.6,these days and a lot of companies are
1397.84,3.28,looking for professionals who know click
1399.44,3.68,view and tab view
1401.12,4.48,but both of them have their own pros and
1403.12,4.72,cons tableau is slower than click view
1405.6,3.68,when it comes to in-memory processing
1407.84,3.44,tableau's interface is more
1409.28,4.16,user-friendly and intuitive
1411.28,3.84,qlikview offers phone support during
1413.44,4.4,regular business hours which tableau
1415.12,2.72,does not
1418.88,4.72,okay someone is asking what is the scope
1421.2,4.32,of microsoft excel in the future will it
1423.6,6.68,get overshadowed with the emergence of
1425.52,4.76,more sophisticated analytics tools
1431.84,4.16,indeed it is true that companies are
1433.679,4.641,inventing a number of analytics tools to
1436.0,4.48,ease their businesses but microsoft
1438.32,4.32,excel continues to be the most preferred
1440.48,4.559,tool for reporting and analysis across
1442.64,4.24,the globe
1445.039,3.921,it is being used by junior level
1446.88,4.32,employees and managers to understand the
1448.96,4.88,data and build reports to make business
1451.2,2.64,decisions
1454.08,5.199,also microsoft's power bi tool is built
1456.48,5.439,on top of excel so in future microsoft
1459.279,5.921,excel will not decay at all i hope
1461.919,3.281,that's answered your question
1468.96,4.16,there is another interesting question
1470.799,4.401,that is why has python become the most
1473.12,5.12,dominating programming language for data
1475.2,4.88,analytics and machine learning
1478.24,4.16,initially the python language was
1480.08,5.04,created only for application development
1482.4,4.56,and web development but since it is open
1485.12,3.52,source there was an opportunity for the
1486.96,3.52,python community to come up with
1488.64,5.279,libraries and packages that could be
1490.48,5.439,used for data analytics
1493.919,4.401,python now provides a wide range of
1495.919,4.721,libraries for numerical computation data
1498.32,4.64,analysis and visualization as well as
1500.64,5.36,machine learning some of these libraries
1502.96,4.719,are numpy pandas matplotlib scipy and
1506.0,3.6,scikit learn
1507.679,3.6,so these libraries and their functions
1509.6,3.679,make python the most powerful
1511.279,5.041,programming language for data analytics
1513.279,3.041,and machine learning
1517.84,3.6,so that brings us to the end of the
1519.52,3.68,question and answer session if you have
1521.44,3.44,more questions please leave them in the
1523.2,4.24,comment section below and we will be
1524.88,4.24,happy to assist you

1529.12,5.439,this video do you agree with our top 10
1531.84,4.8,list think we missed anything important
