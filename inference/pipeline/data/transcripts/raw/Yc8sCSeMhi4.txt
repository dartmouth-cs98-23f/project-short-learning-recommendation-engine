7.919,3.921,hey everyone my name is ishaan and i
10.08,3.519,welcome you all to the session
11.84,4.64,in this session we shall learn the
13.599,4.561,concept of version control in general
16.48,4.4,we shall learn the basics of version
18.16,5.359,control system followed by the benefits
20.88,4.399,of the system and finally we shall have
23.519,4.0,a look at some of the best version
25.279,4.801,control systems in the market
27.519,4.401,but before we begin make sure you're
30.08,3.92,subscribed to our youtube channel and
31.92,4.08,don't forget to click on the bell icon
34.0,4.16,so you never miss an update from simply
36.0,4.8,learn to start learning about the
38.16,4.559,version control system let's begin by
40.8,4.16,talking about a use case
42.719,4.481,imagine there's a multinational company
44.96,4.96,that has offices spread over several
47.2,4.879,countries with thousands of employees
49.92,4.56,so when it is such a big company there
52.079,3.761,might be a set of issues and challenges
54.48,2.88,it would face
55.84,4.48,what could be the possible set of
57.36,5.12,challenges the company faces
60.32,3.36,the company faces the challenge to
62.48,3.36,collaborate
63.68,4.479,there are so many people located at
65.84,5.04,different places there may be a need to
68.159,4.561,communicate for a particular reason or a
70.88,5.36,set of people who are working on the
72.72,6.079,same project but from different regions
76.24,5.04,second challenge is related to storing
78.799,2.481,versions
81.36,4.24,the project is not completed in a single
83.439,3.04,version there may be n number of
85.6,3.44,versions
86.479,4.96,in that situation the problem of storing
89.04,4.079,all such commits in a single place is a
91.439,4.081,huge challenge
93.119,3.841,then another problem is restoring
95.52,4.16,previous versions
96.96,5.04,sometimes it is important to go back to
99.68,5.28,the previous versions to find the root
102.0,5.119,cause of any bug
104.96,3.92,one more common challenge is to figure
107.119,4.561,out what happened
108.88,4.48,at times it is critical to know
111.68,3.6,what changes are made to the previous
113.36,4.079,version of the source code
115.28,4.64,or where exactly has the changes been
117.439,5.441,made in a file
119.92,5.36,then comes the problem of backup in case
122.88,5.04,the system or the disk of the user
125.28,5.84,breaks down and there is no backup then
127.92,5.2,all the efforts will go in vain
131.12,4.56,these are some of the basic problems
133.12,3.759,that any small or big company might
135.68,3.44,encounter
136.879,5.281,now the question arises what could be a
139.12,5.119,possible solution to all such problems
142.16,5.04,and this is when the version control
144.239,5.121,system comes into picture
147.2,4.08,the version control system will take
149.36,4.48,care of the collaboration between
151.28,4.72,employees storing different versions
153.84,4.96,will help in having backups on the
156.0,5.28,remote repository it will also help in
158.8,5.519,rolling back to the previous commits and
161.28,5.599,to the last version of the source code
164.319,5.041,we will talk about each of these reasons
166.879,4.481,in detail when we learn the benefits of
169.36,4.239,the version control system
171.36,5.12,let's first have a look at what is
173.599,2.881,version control
176.64,4.8,as the name version control suggests it
179.12,4.32,refers to the category of software tools
181.44,4.24,that make it possible for the software
183.44,5.12,team to look after the changes made to
185.68,4.8,the source code the system records all
188.56,4.72,the mail changes to a file
190.48,4.399,so a specific version may be rolled if
193.28,3.28,needed in future
194.879,4.161,it is the responsibility of the version
196.56,4.319,control system to keep all the team
199.04,4.32,members on the same page
200.879,4.241,it makes sure that everyone on the team
203.36,4.959,is working on the latest version of the
205.12,5.039,files and most importantly make sure
208.319,4.961,that all these people can work
210.159,5.121,simultaneously on the same project
213.28,3.92,let's try to understand the process with
215.28,4.16,the help of this picture
217.2,4.0,there are three workstations or three
219.44,2.96,different developers at three different
221.2,3.28,locations
222.4,4.0,and there's one repository that is
224.48,3.759,acting as a server
226.4,3.839,the workstations are using the
228.239,4.801,repository either for the process of
230.239,4.56,committing or updating the tasks
233.04,3.759,there may be a larger number of
234.799,3.44,workstations using a single server
236.799,3.601,repository
238.239,4.961,each workstation will have its own
240.4,5.039,working copy and all these workstations
243.2,4.8,will be saving their source codes into a
245.439,5.601,particular server repository
248.0,5.04,this makes it easy for any developer to
251.04,5.039,access the task being done using the
253.04,5.68,repository in case the system of any
256.079,5.361,particular developer breaks down
258.72,4.72,then also the work won't stop as there
261.44,4.96,will be a copy of the source code in the
263.44,5.12,central repository
266.4,4.48,now after knowing the basics of version
268.56,4.639,control it's time for us to check the
270.88,4.72,benefits of version control
273.199,4.161,the first and the foremost advantage of
275.6,4.4,the version control system
277.36,5.68,is that it helps in managing and
280.0,5.04,protecting the source code the system
283.04,3.84,helps in management of the source code
285.04,3.599,for the software team
286.88,4.0,by keeping track of all the
288.639,3.12,modifications that are being made to the
290.88,3.36,code
291.759,4.641,it also protects the source code from
294.24,3.6,any unintended human error and
296.4,4.079,consequences
297.84,5.2,then the next advantage is it keeps
300.479,3.841,record of all the modifications made to
303.04,3.2,the code
304.32,4.0,as we learned in the previous step the
306.24,2.88,way it manages the code for the software
308.32,3.12,team
309.12,4.72,the team is working continuously
311.44,4.4,producing new source codes and it is
313.84,3.44,making amendments to the already
315.84,3.68,existing code
317.28,4.96,these changes are to be recorded for
319.52,5.04,future references and in case they are
322.24,4.32,needed to discover the root cause of any
324.56,4.16,particular problem
326.56,4.56,then the third advantage here talks
328.72,3.44,about comparing earlier versions of the
331.12,3.28,code
332.16,4.16,as we saw that all the versions of the
334.4,4.4,source code are saved
336.32,5.28,this makes it possible for developers
338.8,5.2,to go back at any time and compare the
341.6,5.28,earlier versions of the code to help fix
344.0,4.88,the mistake while reducing disruption to
346.88,3.52,all team members
348.88,4.159,the fourth and the final benefit we
350.4,3.68,shall see is that the version control
353.039,3.681,system
354.08,4.48,supports developers workflow and not any
356.72,4.24,rigid way of working
358.56,5.199,any good version control system will not
360.96,5.2,impose any particular way of working
363.759,4.481,the version control systems are known to
366.16,4.4,provide smooth continuous flow of
368.24,4.72,changes made to the code and prevent
370.56,5.359,developers from getting frustrated in
372.96,5.76,the course of this mechanism
375.919,4.961,now towards the end of the video let's
378.72,5.52,have a look at some of the best version
380.88,6.159,control systems in the market today
384.24,5.28,the first one here is github
387.039,6.081,then comes git lab
389.52,6.72,followed by perforce and bean stock
393.12,4.16,then on number fifth we have aws code
396.24,4.88,commit
397.28,7.199,moving further we have apache subversion
401.12,6.24,team foundation server and mercurial
404.479,6.0,finally we have bitbucket
407.36,4.88,and concurrent version control and now
410.479,3.041,with this we have come to the end of
412.24,3.84,this session
413.52,3.6,i hope you guys found it informative and
416.08,2.88,helpful
