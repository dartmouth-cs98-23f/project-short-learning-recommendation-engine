7.94,7.119,what is big data big data is extremely
12.059,5.041,large or complex set of data and it's so
15.059,4.411,large that it's difficult to process it
17.1,3.679,using traditional database and software
19.47,4.08,techniques
20.779,6.311,every day we are creating approximately
23.55,5.16,2.5 quintillion bytes of data so where
27.09,3.29,is this huge amount of data getting
28.71,4.439,generated from
30.38,4.63,earlier we had mobile phones with the
33.149,4.34,functionality of calling and text
35.01,4.74,messages or clicking some pictures maybe
37.489,4.361,but with the new technologies like
39.75,5.219,smartphones we have a lot of
41.85,5.459,applications for music sports social
44.969,6.031,media like Facebook Twitter Linkedin and
47.309,6.691,many more also data is getting generated
51.0,5.579,when we shop online so why does it need
54.0,4.649,attention as the data is growing
56.579,4.89,companies are capturing the data that
58.649,5.16,streams into their businesses they can
61.469,4.201,apply analytics and get significant
63.809,3.141,value from it with better speed and
65.67,3.96,efficiency
66.95,5.11,companies are leveraging the benefits of
69.63,4.86,big data by analyzing the patterns and
72.06,5.52,trends and predicting something useful
74.49,6.059,out of it for example companies like
77.58,6.84,Amazon and Netflix use big data to
80.549,7.25,improve customer experience as we see
84.42,6.39,here from the statistics shown by 2020
87.799,6.401,1.7 megabytes of data will be created
90.81,5.4,every second for each human this needs
94.2,4.98,immediate attention because this data
96.21,6.03,can't be just thrown away it's going to
99.18,6.39,give profit to the businesses big data
102.24,6.089,challenges big data is not just about
105.57,5.25,the volume of data it poses other
108.329,3.951,challenges as well like velocity and
110.82,4.619,variety as a
112.28,6.879,volume 40 zettabytes of data will be
115.439,6.57,created by 2020 this huge volume of data
119.159,5.881,is either human generated like from
122.009,5.131,social media YouTube or candy machine
125.04,5.279,generated like through sensors and
127.14,6.24,personal health trackers and can also be
130.319,5.371,generated with organizations like card
133.38,5.16,details commercial transactions and
135.69,4.22,medical records another challenge is
138.54,4.02,velocity
139.91,4.75,the speed at which data is coming into
142.56,5.4,the system the data needs to be
144.66,6.45,processed with faster speed and then
147.96,5.46,there is variety of data data is not
151.11,5.73,only structured but unstructured and
153.42,4.94,semi-structured data like images videos
156.84,4.53,and tweets
158.36,6.7,so how our enterprise is using this big
161.37,5.12,data today let us see Big Data popular
165.06,3.2,use cases
166.49,4.12,Internet of Things
168.26,4.63,these are numerous ways in which
170.61,3.14,analytics can be applied to Internet of
172.89,4.05,Things
173.75,5.86,for example sensors are used to collect
176.94,5.91,data that can be analyzed to achieve
179.61,5.15,actionable insights tracking customer or
182.85,4.59,product movement etc
184.76,5.35,many enterprises are creating a
187.44,5.55,dashboard application that provides a
190.11,5.87,360-degree view of the customers that
192.99,5.85,pulls data from a variety of sources
195.98,5.56,analyzes it and presents it to customer
198.84,6.09,service so that allows them to gather
201.54,5.91,the rich insights about businesses big
204.93,5.15,data popular use cases are related
207.45,6.06,information security and data where has
210.08,5.68,optimisations big data tools are being
213.51,5.4,used to remove some of the burdens from
215.76,5.07,the data warehouses even the healthcare
218.91,4.56,industry is looking for patterns and
220.83,3.95,treatment that lead to the best outcomes
223.47,4.2,for patients
224.78,5.17,the main challenge of Big Data is
227.67,5.61,storing and processing the data at a
229.95,5.63,specified time span the traditional
233.28,5.46,approach is not efficient in doing that
235.58,5.83,so Hadoop technology and various big
238.74,4.31,data tools have emerged to solve the
241.41,5.07,challenges faced in the Big Data
243.05,5.56,environment so there are a lot of big
246.48,5.28,data tools and all of them help the user
248.61,6.77,in some or another way in saving time
251.76,5.849,money and uncovering business insights
255.38,4.479,these can be divided into the following
257.609,4.921,categories like data storage and
259.859,6.601,management for example the no sequel
262.53,7.229,databases such as MongoDB Cassandra neo
266.46,7.98,J and HBase are popular nice no sequel
269.759,7.261,databases the talent Hadoop Microsoft HD
274.44,5.81,inside and zookeeper are popular for
277.02,6.11,data storage and management tools
280.25,5.199,next broad category is data cleaning
283.13,3.39,data needs to be cleaned up and
285.449,3.481,well-structured
286.52,4.54,examples of such tools which help in
288.93,5.16,defining and reshaping the data into
291.06,6.78,useable data sets are Microsoft Excel
294.09,6.32,and open refine data mining is a process
297.84,5.31,of discovery in sites within a database
300.41,5.939,some of the popular tools used for data
303.15,6.329,mining are Terra data and rapid miner
306.349,4.931,data visualization tools are a useful
309.479,4.771,way of conveying and complex data
311.28,6.389,insights in a pictorial way that is easy
314.25,6.659,to understand for example tableau and
317.669,6.571,IBM Watson analytics and plotly are the
320.909,6.841,common tools for data reporting power bi
324.24,5.459,tools are used data ingestion is the
327.75,4.62,process of getting the data into Hadoop
329.699,6.631,Ford which can be done using scooped
332.37,6.299,flume or storm data analysis requires
336.33,5.82,asking questions and finding the answers
338.669,7.59,and data the popular tools used for data
342.15,8.04,analysis are hive Pig MapReduce and
346.259,7.021,spark data acquisition is also used for
350.19,5.49,acquiring the data for which scoop flume
353.28,5.52,or storm tools are quite popular
355.68,5.19,the popular Big Data tools offer a lot
358.8,2.66,of advantages which can be summarized as
360.87,3.329,follows
361.46,5.949,they provide the analyst with advanced
364.199,5.52,analytics algorithm and models they help
367.409,5.1,the user to run on big data platforms
369.719,5.911,such as Hadoop or any high-performance
372.509,5.611,analytic systems they helps the user to
375.63,4.379,work not only with structured data but
378.12,5.25,unstructured and semi-structured data
380.009,5.4,coming from multiple sources and it's
383.37,4.2,quite easy to visualize the analysed
385.409,4.831,data in a form that helps in conveying
387.57,5.93,the complex data insights in a pictorial
390.24,6.06,way which is easy to understand by users
393.5,5.21,big data tools help you to integrate
396.3,4.36,with other technologies very easily
