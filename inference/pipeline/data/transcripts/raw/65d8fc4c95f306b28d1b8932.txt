Imagine that you are on a long drive, when you 
suddenly hear your stomach begin to grumble.
You decide to head to a fast food joint, 
where you order a hot dog and a hamburger.  
They're put in similar boxes and 
handed to you through the window.
You have no way of knowing which box has 
the hot dog and which has the burger.
Obviously, once you open one 
of the boxes and see a burger,  
you will immediately know that 
the other one has the hot dog.
This means that the hot dog and the 
burger and entangled in a certain way.
This is roughly the idea upon which 
Quantum Entanglement is based.
follows the rules of Classical Mechanics. 
This is a study of the motion of bodies in  
accordance with the general principles 
first laid down by Sir Isaac Newton.
But what about objects that 
are really, REALLY small?  
Do they also follow these same 
laws of classical mechanics?
Believe it or not, the answer is NO!
When things get that small, 
Quantum Mechanics takes over,  
and things start to get extremely weird...
Quantum mechanics is the language of tiny 
particles like photons—the particles that  
make up light—and particles inside an atom, such 
as protons, neutrons, and electrons. To give you  
a rough idea as to the size of these particles, 
consider this—the tip of a needle is so large  
that it could fit billions of electrons. THAT'S 
how incredibly small electrons truly are.
Now that you have a general idea of the 
size of electrons, let’s talk about identities.
If someone were to ask “Who are you?”, what 
would you say? Probably your name, right?
Now, let’s assume that an anthropomorphic raccoon  
from another planet asks you the same 
question, what would you say then?
Perhaps...“I am Peter Quill, a human from Earth.”
In this case, you specified 
3 levels of identification.
Similarly, in a 3D space, x,y and z coordinates 
are used to specify an object’s exact location,  
as no two objects can have the 
same x,y and z coordinates.  
If you consider a 4-Dimensional space—with time  
(t) as an additional dimension—then no two 
particles can have the same 4 coordinates.
In the same way, an electron has 4 levels of 
identification, consisting of 4 quantum numbers.  
Every electron within an atom has 
a unique set of quantum numbers;  
no two electrons can share the same 
combination of 4 quantum numbers.
Electrons can be identified using these 
4 quantum numbers, which are called:
Principal quantum number
Orbital angular momentum quantum number 
Magnetic quantum number
Electron spin quantum number
All of these quantum numbers are very 
important, as they help determine the  
electron configuration of an atom and the 
probable location of electrons within the atom.
However, for the scope of this video,  
we’re only going to talk about 
the Electron spin quantum number.
The definition of spin is—the intrinsic value of 
the angular momentum of a fundamental particle. An  
electron can either have a positive spin (called 
‘spin up’) or a downward spin (called ‘spin down’)
Now this is where things get bizarre.
When we say an electron has a 
positive spin or a negative spin,  
it doesn’t mean that the electron is ACTUALLY 
spinning. Although it does have angular momentum,  
and proper magnetic orientation, it’s not 
exactly “spinning”. It may actually exist  
in a state of superposition—when it 
has both a negative and positive spin.
You may find the idea of superposition confusing,  
because this doesn’t seem to go along 
with our perception of the real world.
To help explain this a bit better, here’s a 
famous example for understanding superposition:
You might have heard of Schrödinger's Cat;  
it is a famous thought experiment devised by 
Austrian-Irish physicist Erwin Schrödinger.
It goes like this… imagine you put a cat inside 
an opaque soundproof box, along with a radioactive  
substance, a vial of poison and a Geiger 
counter. If the radioactive substance decays,  
then the Geiger counter triggers a setup that 
releases the poison, killing the cat. But the  
decay of the substance is a random process, so 
there’s no way to predict when it will happen.
And that is why, before opening the box,  
you can say that the cat is in a superposition 
of being both alive and dead at the same time.
In the same way, when a coin 
spins on a flat surface,  
it’s in a state of superposition 
between its two faces—head and tails.
Similarly, electrons in their natural state 
exist as a superposition of both up and down  
spin. Only when measured do they give a definite 
value of up or down, which, in technical terms,  
is referred to as the “collapse of the 
wavefunction”. In quantum mechanics, wave function  
collapse occurs when a wave function, which was 
initially in a superposition of a few states,  
reduces to a single state due to 
interaction with the external world.
When a pair of electrons are generated, interact, 
or share spatial proximity, their spin states  
can get entangled, which is what scientists 
call the quantum entanglement of electrons.
Once the electrons are entangled, the two 
electrons can only have opposite spins,  
that is, if one is measured to have “up spin”, 
the second immediately becomes down spin.
Now, we know that the two electrons, 
unmeasured, do not have a single spin,  
but a superposition of both up and down spin. 
If we were to separate the two electrons  
arbitrarily far, say, we put one in a Physics 
lab on Earth and another in a different lab  
somewhere in the Andromeda galaxy, and we 
measure the spin of the electron on Earth,  
we will immediately know the measurement 
of the one in the Andromeda galaxy.
For example, if we measure the 
Earth electron to have up spin,  
we immediately know that the 
other electron has down spin.  
This information traveled instantaneously, 
and faster than the speed of light!
As one can imagine, this idea greatly 
bothered famous physicist Albert Einstein.
It was such a disturbing realization, 
in fact, that he called this phenomenon:  
“spooky action at a distance”. So how can this 
‘spooky action at a distance’ be useful to us?
Well, let's start with one of the most 
common everyday objects—the clock.
Having a common synchronized clock 
is very important in today's world.  
They keep things like stock markets 
and GPS systems in line. Today,  
we have extremely precise clocks, known 
as atomic clocks. The quantum-logic clock  
at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) in Colorado will neither lose  
nor gain one second in some 15 billion years 
(which is roughly the age of the universe).
Entangled atomic systems would not be preoccupied 
with local differences and would instead solely  
measure the passage of time, effectively bringing 
them together as a single pendulum. That means  
adding 100 times more atoms into an entangled 
clock would make it 100 times more precise.
Entangled clocks could even be linked to form 
a worldwide network that would measure time  
independent of location, vastly expanding the 
technology of GPS systems and telecommunication.
Then, of course, there’s quantum cryptography.
As a kid, have you ever made up a secret 
code language that only you and your best  
friend could understand? Imagine that, but 
with the key to cracking the code being  
randomly polarized photons entangled with 
each other. That is quantum cryptography!
Today, some tech companies use 
QKD (Quantum Key Distribution)  
to design ultra-secure networks. In 
2007, Switzerland tried out an ID 
Quantique product to provide a tamper-proof 
voting system during an election.
This system promises to be highly secure, 
because if the photons are entangled,  
any changes to their quantum 
states made by intruders would  
be immediately apparent to 
anyone monitoring the system.
Researchers at Japan’s Hokkaido University 
developed the world’s first entanglement-enhanced  
microscope using a technique known as differential 
interference contrast microscopy. Using entangled  
photons greatly increases the amount of 
information the microscope can gather,  
as measuring one entangled photon 
gives information about its partner.
How about quantum teleportation… is it possible?
Yes, teleportation is possible in the world 
of subatomic particles, but it’s entirely  
different from the way teleportation is 
depicted in movies and popular culture.  
Quantum teleportation involves the transportation 
of information, rather than the transportation of  
matter, which is the type of teleportation 
typically focused on in science fiction.
Physicists continue to delve 
into and understand more about  
the capabilities of quantum entanglement. 
Once we are able to harness this knowledge,  
it could potentially revolutionize 
every aspect of our existence.
Until then, we will continue to try and make sense 
of the principles of quantum mechanics, because,  
let’s face it, it’s a strange 
branch of science that doesn’t  
seem to make any sense in the REAL world.
Basically, as Nobel laureate 
Richard Feynman once said,  
“If you think you understand quantum mechanics, 
you don’t understand quantum mechanics.”
