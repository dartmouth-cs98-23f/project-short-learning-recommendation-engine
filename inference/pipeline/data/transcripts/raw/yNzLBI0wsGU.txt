0.0,5.04,I'm guessing the reason you're watching
3.48,3.12,this video now at this moment is because
5.04,4.219,you've got an interesting human computer
6.6,2.659,interaction
11.99,3.37,[Music]
13.259,3.901,um however you know that doesn't perhaps
15.36,3.48,mean you know exactly what it is maybe
17.16,3.72,you've just said it sounds like a good
18.84,4.62,idea so what is human computer
20.88,4.86,interaction well it's got two sides to
23.46,4.139,it on one side there's an academic
25.74,4.619,discipline which is about studying the
27.599,3.781,way people interact with technology and
30.359,3.601,in particular obviously computer
31.38,4.26,technology nowadays because computers
33.96,3.36,are in virtually everything it's it's
35.64,3.0,quite hard sometimes to tell the
37.32,3.36,difference
38.64,4.14,um but then there's another side to it
40.68,3.3,which is the design discipline and I
42.78,3.779,think probably quite a lot of you
43.98,4.44,watching this video will be from a
46.559,4.02,design side you're interested in user
48.42,4.38,experience design in interaction design
50.579,4.62,and so the so one side for human
52.8,4.2,computer interaction is the academic
55.199,4.741,discipline and the other is the applied
57.0,5.64,design discipline which is about how do
59.94,5.1,you create interventions with technology
62.64,3.72,that make a difference to people so one
65.04,3.78,side is studying that computer
66.36,4.98,technology and how it has an impact on
68.82,4.2,people so the way in which it works and
71.34,5.099,the other is more about saying that how
73.02,5.7,do we practically change that academic
76.439,4.68,study that inter information we have
78.72,5.399,about the way people have work
81.119,5.941,into action The Two Of course interact
84.119,6.661,so on one hand the professional
87.06,5.699,experience informs the academic
90.78,4.62,discipline and you'll probably notice
92.759,6.0,that I use lots of examples some from my
95.4,6.0,own experience some from stories I know
98.759,5.461,about from elsewhere and I use those
101.4,6.179,from all sorts of times in order to
104.22,4.8,inform my general understanding
107.579,4.141,because it works the other way around
109.02,5.58,that that academic understand that more
111.72,4.8,generic understanding feeds back into
114.6,4.019,the design discipline so so if I
116.52,4.32,understand how people interact with
118.619,4.201,individual computers how people interact
120.84,4.68,together in a group when they're using
122.82,4.979,technology how people how environments
125.52,4.56,change the way people are if those
127.799,4.44,environments have technology in then
130.08,4.98,I'll be in a better position to be able
132.239,6.181,to design things effectively for them so
135.06,5.22,these two are are intermingled
138.42,3.66,So within if you want to understand
140.28,3.599,human computer interaction if you want
142.08,4.26,to be part of this you know what kind of
143.879,5.101,things would I like you to know about
146.34,4.56,and so what what would I hope you'd
148.98,4.32,learn from studying human computer
150.9,4.8,interaction well first of all is bear
153.3,4.439,facts um there's facts about the the
155.7,4.14,nature of computers there's facts about
157.739,4.381,the nature of of human psychology
159.84,4.56,physiology there's a whole range of
162.12,3.839,things social interactions
164.4,3.72,um so there's lots of facts about that
165.959,4.081,of course the fact is you can read in a
168.12,4.259,book and I've got my own textbook that I
170.04,4.5,produced on this and um and there are
172.379,4.381,many many others um also on the web
174.54,5.16,there's vast amounts of material so in
176.76,5.52,some sense the facts are easy to get and
179.7,4.14,you will get some of those now hopefully
182.28,3.36,um when I when I talk about human
183.84,4.5,computer interaction you get some of
185.64,4.92,those fats however perhaps there's other
188.34,4.5,things which are more important
190.56,3.84,um the second thing I hope I'd hope
192.84,4.08,you'd learn from human computer
194.4,4.979,interaction is about analysis it's about
196.92,5.52,looking at the situation and trying to
199.379,4.681,make sense of it what's going on there
202.44,4.62,because if you understand the situation
204.06,4.86,then you can apply the facts to the
207.06,4.56,situation so it's about analysis about
208.92,4.26,it picking some things apart picking the
211.62,4.86,problems that you're having a part or
213.18,5.58,picking the opportunities apart and then
216.48,4.14,of course once you've done that analysis
218.76,4.32,together with the facts and knowledge
220.62,4.46,from that you can then do a design job
223.08,5.28,so you can bring these things together
225.08,5.14,in order to synthesize them in order to
228.36,4.76,create something that will be a solution
230.22,2.9,to somebody's problem
233.159,4.681,um but perhaps more important illness
235.44,5.4,than all of that obviously you need the
237.84,5.459,knowledge side and you need the skills
240.84,4.259,and to do it but perhaps the most
243.299,4.02,important thing with you within human
245.099,5.22,computer interaction particularly if you
247.319,5.821,think of it in terms of moving on into
250.319,5.28,design is an attitude of mine an
253.14,5.76,attitude that focuses on people that
255.599,5.1,sees real users real situations as
258.9,3.48,Center place
260.699,4.261,um that is seeking to understand people
262.38,4.86,however different they are from you
264.96,3.42,um and to do things which are good for
267.24,3.54,them
268.38,4.08,um and make sense in their lives so
270.78,3.54,that's that's sort of what you know our
272.46,3.54,purpose is in a way particularly as
274.32,3.84,every move from the the sort of just
276.0,4.86,studying people to actually say how do
278.16,4.62,we design something for them so it's all
280.86,3.42,kinds of things might you want to know
282.78,3.66,about these and what sort of kind of
284.28,5.1,things I'll often talk about in this in
286.44,5.4,this context so one set of things is
289.38,4.98,about the basics of design you know so
291.84,4.38,this goes from sort of processes that
294.36,4.619,people use when they're doing design and
296.22,5.22,you may be using yourself to methods of
298.979,4.861,evaluation to understanding the nature
301.44,3.199,of Human Experience
303.84,3.6,um
304.639,6.521,undergirding that is sort of fundamental
307.44,5.58,and denial lying knowledge and theories
311.16,3.78,um and some of those particularly about
313.02,5.28,the human about human perception
314.94,5.34,cognition emotion but that also leaks
318.3,3.959,into the uh understands the way
320.28,3.96,computers work as well to the extent
322.259,4.021,that it's important from a from the
324.24,3.299,point of view of their interactions with
326.28,3.12,people
327.539,3.781,um and then from a sort of practical
329.4,4.2,point of view you also need to think
331.32,4.62,about and be aware of the issues that
333.6,3.659,happen when systems are implemented
335.94,3.479,again that's partly about the way
337.259,4.44,they're implemented in the computer but
339.419,5.041,also the way in which they get deployed
341.699,4.201,into the world and this will vary from
344.46,4.5,from place to place but sort of the
345.9,5.22,general principles of how you make sure
348.96,4.799,that this wonderful system that you
351.12,4.139,designed actually gets used by people in
353.759,4.341,the real world and makes a real
355.259,2.841,difference to me
