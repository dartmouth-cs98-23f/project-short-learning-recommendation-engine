6.14,4.659,well let's start with a classical
8.43,7.17,computer a classical computer takes bits
10.799,7.501,ones and zeroes and arranges them in in
15.6,5.55,a core processor made up of classical
18.3,5.569,components processes them using Algar
21.15,7.109,and arithmetic and logical operations
23.869,6.88,and gets out an answer in the case of a
28.259,4.861,quantum computer we start off with a
30.749,5.521,different definition of the bit the bit
33.12,5.22,is now a superposition of ones and zeros
36.27,5.04,in other words it's a sort of parallel
38.34,6.53,one and zero at the same time if I take
41.31,6.63,n bits then I can explore all possible
44.87,7.57,questions to an some ask my computer
47.94,8.63,also the computer itself will exist in
52.44,6.99,many superposition states of possible
56.57,6.34,processes going on inside and it's that
59.43,5.519,parallelism that actually provides this
62.91,5.61,exponential speed-up for particular
64.949,6.541,problems one very important problem of
68.52,7.22,course is the problem of factorization
71.49,8.009,of very large numbers which is in
75.74,6.939,classical computers exponential in size
79.499,5.97,of the problem whereas in quantum
82.679,5.4,computers it takes polynomial time and
85.469,5.64,thus makes most of our internet
88.079,6.021,communications insecure if we can make a
91.109,2.991,quantum computer
