second,duration,transcript
4.46,1.28,- Good morning.
5.74,1.44,"Okay, so I'm Zahra Ashktorab"
7.18,2.52,"from IBM Research and I'm
really excited to present to you"
9.7,3.81,"the work we did on Quantum
Human-Computer Interaction."
13.51,1.43,"I did this work with my colleagues,"
14.94,3.153,"Justin Weisz and Maryam
Ashoori, from IBM Research."
19.37,2.59,"So, quantum computing was once considered"
21.96,1.49,"a purely theoretical domain,"
23.45,2.87,"but it's rapidly becoming a
reality with the availability"
26.32,3.15,"of publicly accessible
quantum computing systems"
29.47,1.87,and has recently gained a lot of attention
31.34,2.61,"for the things that it can
potentially accomplish."
33.95,3.15,"It has the potential
to accomplish problems,"
37.1,2.36,"considered intractable
for classical computers."
39.46,2.48,"For example, scientists
have used computers"
41.94,2.27,to determine the ground state energy
44.21,4.26,"for Beryllium hydride, a
complex inorganic molecule."
48.47,1.87,"Performing these kinds of simulations,"
50.34,2.41,"has a tremendous computational cost,"
52.75,2.65,often intractable for classical computers
55.4,1.48,but the results of these simulations
56.88,2.83,"may lead to discovery of
new drugs and materials"
59.71,2.203,and even bolster clean energy efforts.
63.01,2.8,"So, one might ask, how did HCI researchers"
65.81,1.99,get involved with quantum HCI?
67.8,2.65,"And are interested in
defining a new practice"
70.45,2.18,"of quantum HCI, stem from our experiences"
72.63,2.44,"in joining a new team, that was focused"
75.07,2.5,on building tools for quantum scientists.
77.57,2.52,"As HCI researchers new
to quantum computing,"
80.09,2.59,we found ourselves spending a lot of time
82.68,3.13,"familiarizing ourselves
and learning new concepts"
85.81,1.76,and terminology that were quite outside
87.57,1.37,of our comfort zone.
88.94,2.9,"And during this process, we
realized the tremendous impact"
91.84,3.0,"that good HCI research and
practice could have on the field."
97.87,1.5,"So in this talk, I'm gonna begin"
99.37,2.683,with a short primer on quantum computing.
103.93,2.54,"So in classical computing,
information is encoded"
106.47,4.0,"with bits that are either
in the state of zero or one."
110.47,4.55,"In quantum computing,
information is encoded in qubits"
115.02,1.36,"and as with classical computing,"
116.38,2.79,they can be in a state of zero or one
119.17,3.94,"but they may also exist in
the state of superposition"
123.11,3.13,"in which their true state is
unknown until it is measured"
126.24,2.58,"and they may also be entangled
with each other such that,"
128.82,2.94,measuring the state of one qubit tells us
131.76,2.94,"about the state of the
other without measuring it."
134.7,2.33,"And so these are just
some very basic features"
137.03,2.333,that make quantum computing so powerful.
141.52,0.99,"Next, I'm gonna talk about"
142.51,3.3,existing quantum computing tools.
145.81,2.29,So there's a number of tools available
148.1,1.75,"for programming quantum systems,"
149.85,3.18,"both in simulation and
with actual hardware."
153.03,2.69,"GUIs such as IBM's composer and Quirk,"
155.72,2.78,"enable people to program
their own quantum circuits"
158.5,2.04,and visualize the results.
160.54,3.1,"There's also programming
languages and SDKs such as,"
163.64,2.597,IBM's Qiskit and Microsoft's LIQUi.
166.237,2.613,"And they allow people to
develop quantum algorithms"
168.85,3.313,"and run them in simulation,
sometimes on actual hardware."
174.29,3.36,"Next, I'm gonna talk about
the methods that we used."
177.65,2.43,"So we recruited a small
batch of participants"
180.08,2.04,"from our own organization
through an email,"
182.12,1.957,seeking individuals who conduct research
184.077,1.653,and quantum computing.
185.73,2.19,We then did snowball sampling by asking
187.92,2.23,who they would recommend to speak with
190.15,2.72,"both internal and external
to our organization."
192.87,1.9,We had a total of seven participants
194.77,2.333,"from industry, government and academia."
199.2,1.67,Our interviews were semi-structured
200.87,3.29,"and probed the following areas;
education and background,"
204.16,1.98,"application and algorithms,"
206.14,2.513,"programming tools and
workflow and community."
210.45,1.16,"So the next couple of slides,"
211.61,2.3,I'm gonna talk about the areas of inquiry
214.92,1.81,"which we identify
through these interviews."
216.73,3.5,"The first of which was,
understanding quantum users,"
220.23,3.54,"developing and evaluating
educational materials,"
223.77,2.59,designing programming and debugging tools
226.36,2.163,"and finally, visualizing quantum."
230.99,2.715,Designing effective technologies
233.705,2.795,for effective programming quantum systems
236.5,2.56,"requires an understanding of
the different types of people"
239.06,1.61,who will use those systems.
240.67,1.41,And our quantum development team
242.08,2.15,had conducted early stage user research
244.23,2.36,that identified three quantum users;
246.59,4.193,"quantum scientists, science
enthusiasts and developers."
251.62,3.05,"Our first group quantum
scientists, include professors,"
254.67,2.15,postdocs and graduate students in physics
256.82,2.06,and quantum information science.
258.88,2.8,"They perform experiments
using quantum simulators"
261.68,2.48,on real quantum computers.
264.16,2.28,"Science enthusiasts are
people who have an interest"
266.44,2.16,"in quantum computing
but no formal background"
268.6,1.63,or training in it.
270.23,2.26,"They may be university students, academics"
272.49,2.35,"and industry professionals
all with varying levels"
274.84,2.69,of expertise and programming
277.53,3.323,"and their primary needs are
for educational materials."
282.5,1.42,Our third group are developers
283.92,1.79,and though this group may have
285.71,2.67,"an extensive knowledge
on classical computing,"
288.38,2.58,"their knowledge of quantum
computing is limited."
290.96,1.75,"For this audience, SDKs"
292.71,2.11,that provide a higher level functionality
294.82,2.42,and hide the lower level technical details
297.24,3.213,"of their quantum
implementation are desired."
302.39,3.09,"So we believe that we captured
only a preliminary snapshot"
305.48,1.65,"of quantum computing users,"
307.13,1.65,and additional research is needed
309.76,2.68,"to more comprehensively
identify the people"
312.44,2.333,who are currently using quantum computers.
316.42,2.307,"One of our participants said,
""I think there's another layer"
318.727,2.19,"of user that we will
eventually connect with,"
320.917,1.87,"which is, I want to
use a quantum computer"
322.787,3.29,"to accelerate a certain
aspect of a certain problem"
326.077,2.57,"but I wanted as a piece
of a much bigger solution."
328.647,2.13,The technical folks and banks and finance
330.777,2.35,"and chemical design
already have environments"
333.127,3.69,"they are using to work inside
and I think I will eventually"
336.817,1.83,take quantum and plug it in.
341.15,2.27,"Quantum computing is a
highly technical subject"
343.42,2.08,"and that said, there are
several notable efforts"
345.5,1.53,that have aimed to make quantum computing
347.03,3.2,"more accessible, interesting and fun."
350.23,4.67,"There are introductory
guides that have low math"
354.9,2.69,"or no math introductions
to quantum computing,"
357.59,1.34,metaphor based approaches
358.93,3.26,"to teach the fundamental
principles of quantum mechanics,"
362.19,2.903,"quantum games and online
quantum communities."
367.36,1.37,"So over the last decade,"
368.73,1.65,"there've been emergence
of introductory books"
370.38,2.35,that are intended for general audiences.
372.73,2.43,"Additionally, institutions
like IBM, D-Wave,"
375.16,3.68,"and Microsoft provide
introductory tutorials"
378.84,2.46,for beginners to quantum computing.
381.3,1.12,Another approach to teach
382.42,2.8,"principles of quantum
computing is via metaphors."
385.22,3.37,"So, Schrodinger's cat explains
the concept of superposition"
388.59,1.38,via thought experiment.
389.97,2.77,"A cat is kept in a box
with a bottle of poison"
392.74,1.91,and is simultaneously dead and alive
394.65,2.79,"because it is unknown whether
the cat drank the poison."
397.44,1.56,"And for HCI researchers here,"
399.0,2.74,"there's an opportunity
to evaluate the extent"
401.74,1.51,to which these guides and metaphors
403.25,2.003,teach beginners about quantum computing.
406.96,3.12,"There's also been several
noteworthy digital games,"
410.08,2.92,"designed to specifically
teach about quantum computing."
413.0,3.27,"Quantum tic-tac-toe, mechanic
and Hello quantum are games"
416.27,2.64,that both require players to solve puzzles
418.91,2.68,by trying to teach quantum concepts.
421.59,1.56,Entanglion is a board game designed
423.15,3.0,"to teach fundamental concepts
of quantum computing."
426.15,2.24,"And for HCI researchers
here, there's an opportunity"
428.39,2.28,"to both design and
evaluate the effectiveness"
430.67,2.9,"of these games for their
ability to scaffold learners"
433.57,1.84,through the process of understanding
435.41,2.48,"core quantum computing
concepts to the point"
437.89,1.843,of programming quantum systems.
442.24,2.07,"So from our interviews, we
found that many of issues"
444.31,2.77,"with the online communities
stem from the fact that,"
447.08,1.82,the platforms did not distinguish
448.9,2.177,"between these novices and experts,"
451.077,2.133,"and our participants,
experts in their field,"
453.21,1.801,"which is one of the
limitations of our study,"
455.011,3.209,"express preferences for
specialized communities"
458.22,3.5,"that encourage deep discussions
and information exchange."
461.72,1.79,"That being said, we're not advocating"
463.51,2.47,"for creating a separation
or information gate"
465.98,2.14,"between the novices and experts,"
468.12,1.87,"but a lot of these issues,"
469.99,2.31,"these online communities
can be vastly improved"
472.3,3.5,"by applying the lessons learned
by HCI and CSCW researchers"
475.8,2.283,in building successful online communities.
479.16,2.05,"I'm gonna go ahead and
read one of the quotes"
481.21,1.887,from an applied mathematician.
483.097,2.2,"When you go in the community,
you sometimes read questions"
485.297,1.63,from people who clearly have no idea
486.927,1.4,"what quantum computing is,"
488.327,2.49,"because they have high
expectations of what it can do"
490.817,1.68,and that is not the case.
493.66,2.19,We also ask participants about the tools
495.85,2.87,"and programming languages they
use and discuss the potential"
498.72,2.84,of HCI research in the following areas;
501.56,4.0,"Paper, GUI and code,
documentation and sharing,"
505.56,3.613,"debugging quantum algorithms
and quantum native programming."
511.47,1.82,Despite the numerous tools available
513.29,1.55,"for programming quantum systems,"
514.84,2.26,low fidelity tools have a strong foothold
517.1,3.11,"in the day-to-day workflow
of quantum scientists"
520.21,3.08,"but, visual tools like
IBM's composer and Quirk,"
523.29,3.26,"are also really helpful in
applying what has been drawn"
526.55,2.16,on these low fidelity tools.
528.71,2.39,"And they use circuit-like
metaphor in which each qubit"
531.1,2.41,is represented by a horizontal line.
533.51,2.117,"One quantum chemist said,
""There's a big difference"
535.627,2.17,"between writing a circuit
on a piece of paper"
537.797,2.52,"and actually trying to
implement it on a machine."
540.317,1.83,"It's like trying to learn computing,"
542.147,1.45,just reading the theory of computing
543.597,1.68,but never learning a programming language
545.277,2.89,"or getting anything to
work or debug anything."
550.35,2.46,"As more people delve
into quantum computing"
552.81,1.97,"such as science
enthusiasts and developers,"
554.78,2.51,"a need arises for environments
that better integrate"
557.29,2.15,documentation and sharing tools
559.44,2.19,and well-documented workflows
561.63,2.303,are integral to the learning process.
567.1,2.84,"As with any development
workflow, debugging is a part"
569.94,2.06,of the quantum computing process.
572.0,2.43,"One participant described
how she debunked her code"
574.43,1.987,by switching amongst different tools.
576.417,1.55,When I'm tryna figure out an algorithm
577.967,2.7,"or debug something, I will
start with the composer"
580.667,2.623,"and if I wanna make any
changes, I go over to QASM."
583.29,1.817,Which is quantum assembly language.
585.107,1.02,"To change things there,"
586.127,2.823,and I go back and forth between the two.
588.95,2.24,"Another described how he
used the quantum simulator"
591.19,1.72,to perform debugging as a simulator
592.91,1.67,"and able to want to
view the internal state"
594.58,1.397,of all the qubits.
595.977,2.51,"To debug, we used a C
simulator for everything."
598.487,0.93,"Out of the simulator,"
599.417,3.083,"you can get the internal
state of all the qubits."
602.5,2.57,"A deeper understanding of
how quantum programmers"
605.07,1.89,"could conduct the debugging process,"
606.96,2.45,"would provide opportunities
for developing new kinds"
609.41,2.04,of quantum debugging tools
611.45,2.02,"and this work should
build on previous research"
613.47,1.63,that demonstrates the best practices
615.1,1.753,for scientific computing.
619.41,1.83,"So the development of
programming languages"
621.24,2.3,for quantum computers largely mirrors that
623.54,3.62,"of classical computers but on
a much more rapid time scale."
627.16,2.44,Early quantum system programming evolved
629.6,2.36,"from placing quantum gates
directly on a circuit"
631.96,1.89,"to writing assembly style code,"
633.85,3.28,"using the open quantum
language, assembly language."
637.13,2.32,"But there's also newer
SDKs such as Qiskit,"
639.45,3.04,"that rely on Python to provide
a high-level abstraction"
642.49,2.29,"which are then translated
down to the level of QASM"
644.78,3.824,"before executing on real
quantum hardware simulation."
648.604,2.046,"A one opportunity for HCI researchers,"
650.65,2.36,"is to consider whether
these abstractions use"
653.01,2.68,"to programming classical
computers should be applied"
655.69,2.783,for programming quantum systems.
661.52,3.47,"Visualization of qubit states
are difficult to create"
664.99,2.84,"because the number of
achievable quantum states"
667.83,3.26,"is exponential with respect
to the number of qubits."
671.09,2.14,"And so, HCI researchers here can utilize"
673.23,1.99,information visualization methods
675.22,1.75,to build more effective visualizations
676.97,1.66,for quantum computing.
678.63,2.48,"User studies exploring
the interpretability"
682.1,1.08,of large-scale graphs
683.18,2.93,"and other large-scale
visualizations can contribute"
686.11,2.943,"to improve visualizations
of quantum states."
692.18,2.18,"So I'm going to also
talk about moving forward"
694.36,2.673,"and what next, what the
future might look like."
698.19,2.9,"So, while we favorably
suggest potential directions"
701.09,2.58,"for the expansion of quantum computing,"
703.67,2.11,"we acknowledge that our
optimism must be tempered"
705.78,1.583,with realities of the field.
708.79,3.31,"So a lot of these scientists
did talk about skepticism."
712.1,1.957,"One of the quantum chemist said,"
714.057,2.04,The same thing happened with nano and AI.
716.097,1.72,"At one point, they get hyped"
717.817,1.95,"because they make a
few advances and then,"
719.767,1.66,they don't deliver on their promises
721.427,1.62,"and then they get trashed so then,"
723.047,1.58,no one gives them attention.
724.627,1.67,"While they are being ignored, they slowly"
726.297,1.7,or maybe even incrementally improve.
727.997,3.133,"So suddenly, they have
some major advances."
731.13,1.847,"One of our other participants said,"
732.977,1.343,We don't want the same thing happening
734.32,1.577,with quantum as with AI.
735.897,2.12,"Over hyping it and then realizing,"
738.017,2.16,"that you can't accomplish
what you want to accomplish"
740.177,1.28,and then abandoning it.
743.01,3.15,"But these insurgencies
around quantum computing"
746.16,2.76,"and potential for disillusionment
should not be reasons"
748.92,1.91,"to avoid approaching the field,"
750.83,2.89,"instead, we see them as
opportunities to show the strength"
753.72,1.763,that great HCI research can bring.
756.99,1.163,Thank you.
758.153,2.25,(applause)
764.06,1.39,- [Woman] Thank you.
765.45,2.4,"So, if anybody has questions,"
767.85,1.703,"we have this microphone here,"
770.53,3.98,"we also have a loose microphone
and the student volunteer"
774.51,3.16,"who's gonna run around, so
you can just raise your hand."
777.67,0.833,Any questions?
782.47,0.833,Yeah.
785.24,2.15,"- [Eliana] Hey, I'm Eliana Husky Douglas"
787.39,1.68,from Alta University.
789.07,3.26,"So I've actually heard quantum
physics not in this sense,"
792.33,2.38,"but more in the sort
of adjunct on realism,"
794.71,2.26,"STS, sort of societal thing."
796.97,3.313,"Do you see that more merging
with this area of work?"
801.99,1.94,"- That's not something
that we really asked about,"
803.93,4.8,we were focused on these front end tools
808.73,2.35,for quantum computing but I think
811.08,2.48,"it's such an expansive field
and it's continuously growing."
813.56,2.21,"So I can imagine that there
are front ending tools"
815.77,2.05,for those for those applications as well.
823.1,2.913,"- [Woman] Any other
questions from the audience?"
831.53,2.19,"Last chance, all right."
833.72,1.873,Let's thank Zahra again.
