second,duration,transcript
22.939,5.611,"Hello Namaste welcome back to the module where
we are looking at how a database works."
28.55,5.13,"What is the database management system etc.,
So in the previous class we learnt what do"
33.68,5.24,"we mean by a data then we evolved in terms
of what do you mean by database then look"
38.92,4.97,"at the database system and the database management
system which is an application."
43.89,3.04,So we have looked at all of these.
46.93,3.409,"Now let us get into what do you mean by database
management system."
50.339,1.211,How does it works?
51.55,6.279,"What are the different relations that exist
in this particular database management system"
57.829,5.361,"and how we perceive that particular relationship
will look at all of these in this particular"
63.19,1.0,lecture.
64.19,4.8,"And when we look at the concepts that would
be covered in this particular class first"
68.99,4.7,"thing that I would speak about is what do
you mean by a database management system components."
73.69,2.64,Components in a database management system.
76.33,6.88,"Then characteristics of a database management
system then we define what is an entity."
83.21,5.51,"So now we will also take it ahead and look
at something called as an entity relationship."
88.72,5.92,"How entities are related what are the different
relationships that exist and the same concepts"
94.64,2.86,that we were looking at the spatial aspects.
97.5,3.5,So we would now put it in terms of a database.
101.0,5.16,"Now look at with then we would look at what
do you mean by database management system"
106.16,2.17,architecture ok.
108.33,2.51,"What is the architecture of a database management
system?"
110.84,4.87,"Then there are a database management system
language a broad definition of languages I"
115.71,5.85,"am not getting into very specific a very broad
system of different languages in database"
121.56,1.81,management system.
123.37,5.3,"So when we look at the component of the database
a first and foremost important component of"
128.67,2.459,database is the database engine.
131.129,4.481,"When we look at this database engine it is
the heart of the database management system"
135.61,5.25,"responsible for storing, retrieving and updating
the data."
140.86,5.59,"So this is like a backbone or the heart of
a database management system."
146.45,6.56,"So this is a this runs through the entire
structure and is very important for storing,"
153.01,2.31,retrieving and updating the data.
155.32,3.88,There is another concept called data dictionary.
159.2,4.08,"So dictionary it holds definition for all
the data tables okay."
163.28,8.82,"It is like a defining key in which actually
is defining all the tables are at the definition"
172.1,5.71,"of all the table that describes the type of
the data and being that are being stored in"
177.81,2.59,that particular database ok.
180.4,5.98,"So then we have a query processor so when
we look at these towards query and processor"
186.38,1.57,which means it is a processing a query.
187.95,6.27,"Let us a fun it is basically a fundamental
component which enables users and developers"
194.22,2.32,to store and retrieve data ok.
196.54,2.47,It is both storing and retrieving.
199.01,5.71,"So when we say querying you are either you
are actually storing somewhere the data retrieving"
204.72,1.12,the data.
205.84,8.07,"So all these database operations can run through
a query language like a sequential query language"
213.91,5.24,"SQL, MySQL very well-known query languages
the MySQL ok."
219.15,6.26,"Though it has a evolved over a period of time
but now also MySQL as quite well known."
225.41,4.25,"And when you when the next component is report
writer."
229.66,8.27,"So though this particular component is more
or less not the evolved over a period of time"
237.93,6.8,"but it enables us to setup a report to on
the screen to specify how items will be displayed"
244.73,1.619,or calculated.
246.349,2.581,So these are normally used to generate reports.
248.93,5.41,"So in many systems many database systems they
have different way of defining it but report"
254.34,5.619,"writer is generally to actually compile all
the information and generate report about"
259.959,3.161,the those informationâ€™s.
263.12,2.07,Then we have something called as a forms generator.
265.19,4.4,"It is an input screen that helps developer
to create forms."
269.59,7.639,"So are it is input screen that helps developers
to create and way of connecting into the system."
277.229,4.181,"Then you have an application generator and
when you look at an application generator"
281.41,4.53,"as an application is this collection in terms
of forms that is this number of forms what"
285.94,5.29,"would have been generated it is nothing but
the collection of those form and reports by"
291.23,1.0,the report generator.
292.23,5.79,"It is a final package that consist of tools
and that assist developer in creating the"
298.02,2.14,complete package.
300.16,2.99,"Either a developer or a user to create a complete
package."
303.15,3.51,Normally it has done by a developer ok.
306.66,6.22,"Then you have communication and integration
which allows to share data with other machines"
312.88,2.65,across different communication networks.
315.53,5.07,"So it is based on relationship it based on
addresses it is based on the way you want"
320.6,5.69,"to query data or you want to access data that
in this communication and integration works."
326.29,4.43,"Then the security being a very complex issue
in the database."
330.72,7.0,"So it has many layers of security many kinds
of security that will be embedded in terms"
337.72,3.34,of a component in a database management system.
341.06,6.22,"And when you look at database management system
always any of those any systems whether it"
347.28,5.92,"is storing data or integrating data, collecting
data and then storing processing etc., always"
353.2,2.17,is dependent on the model ok.
355.37,6.12,"A kind of model which actually defines how
the structure is there how it is saved?"
361.49,4.55,"How it is retrieved and how different systems
work."
366.04,7.56,"So when we look at the underlying the structure
of the database always you have as I said"
373.6,1.26,is a data model.
374.86,5.36,"A data model is the collection so let us be
very specific here it is a collection of conceptual"
380.22,1.25,tools.
381.47,5.5,"So it is a collection of conceptual tools
that describe data ok."
386.97,5.21,"So when you are speaking about data that are
tools that can describe data that can describe"
392.18,4.239,data relationship describe data semantic.
396.419,5.681,"When I say semantics, these are usage of very
specific in data ok."
402.1,5.97,"And how the consistent of a consistent consistency
a constraint are maintained."
408.07,3.76,"So these are very important in terms of a
data model."
411.83,5.71,"So it is the tool which actually connects
or describes all of these ok."
417.54,3.53,"That is why that is what is called the data
model ok."
421.07,6.65,"So when I say a data model it has support
for multiple data types it can have for example"
427.72,6.35,"you can have MS access and this MS access,
text in terms of memo on numbers, date whatever."
434.07,4.24,"If you have if you used MS access most of
this can be done."
438.31,4.97,"Whether it is qualitative, quantitative, ordinary
data whatever kind of data that you want to"
443.28,3.31,put in can be put in such databases.
446.59,7.389,"And when you look at another important aspect
is that it is the data model actually starts"
453.979,4.97,"from the where the data is stored as a file
in the database."
458.949,5.421,"Either loading of the databases from different
databases and processing it an application"
464.37,3.42,this all thing is done using a data model.
467.79,6.96,"So if your nutshell if you have to say this
is an index for our rapid retrieval ok."
474.75,3.07,"So it is like a book you have number of pages
in a book."
477.82,4.31,"Each page have let us say a certain number
of pages have certain chapters in a book."
482.13,5.94,"So it acts as a index chapter and helps in
retrieving managing and processing any anything"
488.07,3.61,in that book is nothing but a data model ok.
491.68,5.58,"So it is in a nutshell we can just say it
is an index for processing retrieving any"
497.26,6.08,"information in that particular database is
nothing but a data model."
503.34,7.26,"When you look at characteristic of a database
management system it consists of query language."
510.6,6.411,"For example a sequential query language a
MySQL is another query language this is a"
517.011,6.169,"very intrinsic part of how the query is directed
in to the system and that is how that system"
523.18,1.469,would programmed.
524.649,7.641,"Then you have security control of the data
or the controlled access to the data."
532.29,5.419,"So that that is the security forms another
characteristic of database management system"
537.709,5.731,"the better the security the better the database
management system multilevel groups for example"
543.44,1.82,sensors NGA.
545.26,2.42,So all of these groups can be easily accessed.
547.68,3.349,"So you have different groups for different
groups for different access you have different"
551.029,5.93,"ways of accessing each of this you have different
user groups which have different powers of"
556.959,1.281,accessing this data.
558.24,3.53,"So that is how a database management system
is done."
561.77,3.62,"Then you have controlled update using a transaction
manager."
565.39,5.54,"So many of times you may also see that you
have to visit a particular site or a visit"
570.93,6.26,"a particular or write to a particular person
in order to have some restriction removed"
577.19,2.3,facts of a particular data.
579.49,3.98,"So that is what is called controlled update
using a transaction manager."
583.47,5.11,"Then you have versioning is a very important
form of the database which actually keeps"
588.58,6.33,"a track of what has improved and how the previous
errors or loopholes in the database have been"
594.91,2.07,corrected over a period of time.
596.98,6.09,"Then the last one is the backup and recovery
and this forms a very important part of any"
603.07,6.28,"database because without backups then maybe
certain issues sometimes maybe that particular"
609.35,4.84,"system where the entire database is cornered
on the system that is acting as a server may"
614.19,5.13,fail because everything as its own self life.
619.32,3.1,So once it is self-life is over it may fail.
622.42,6.94,"So in order to have a backup if the systematical
backup is done now if that database can automatically"
629.36,5.71,"do it either to a cloud system or to a system
that is physically there then or it is remotely"
635.07,3.199,"connected then it becomes a best part of the
database."
638.269,2.701,"So it is very intrinsic characteristic of
a database."
640.97,6.429,"So always most of the database system management
system have their own way of backing up the"
647.399,2.801,data and also the recovery of data.
650.2,7.16,"That is also very essentially very important
in term of having database management system."
657.36,5.75,"And when we look at the characteristics of
database management system we also can look"
663.11,4.24,"at in terms of application I have already
spoke about each of these."
667.35,5.39,"This application there are form builders a
report writer and internet application server"
672.74,4.5,"which is actually interacting with the user
and different portals."
677.24,3.42,"For example if you are looking at sensors,
if you are looking at Aadhar, if you are looking"
680.66,5.21,"at any other different portals so it is actually
looking at it acts as a bridge between the"
685.87,2.06,user and that particular portal.
687.93,7.08,"Then you have case tools which is looking
at particular case in terms of the query handling"
695.01,7.47,"or query processing etc., Then the most important
point of todayâ€™s system is programmable"
702.48,4.43,API or applications program interface.
706.91,6.36,"So this is has become extremely important
in terms of how do we define a API?"
713.27,1.83,How do we mange an API?
715.1,1.739,How do we present an API?
716.839,6.741,"So that because that is also a very challenging
task today that becomes a characteristic of"
723.58,2.1,database management system.
725.68,6.339,"So if you have to put in what is a role of
a database management system at GIS?"
732.019,6.541,"If you look at it when you look at GIS task
ok let us take it separately and let us look"
738.56,1.0,at it.
739.56,3.5,If you look at GIS task what is it task?
743.06,2.8,The first thing is loading of a data.
745.86,3.8,"So when you acquire the data then you load
the data."
749.66,5.44,"Once you have load the data you edit the data
you either edit it or analyze it."
755.1,6.32,"So once you have analyze it you can visualize
it ok and finally you will map it that is"
761.42,3.2,how the GIS task work.
764.62,6.37,"So the same task is can be done in terms of
a database management system."
770.99,7.21,"So this task is somewhere for example when
you are looking at storage the database management"
778.2,6.47,"task is first storage indexing it then querying
it and maintaining it security layer."
784.67,3.349,"So when you are integrating both of this is
data load."
788.019,3.991,"So when you have a data load you are actually
looking at storage and security of both of"
792.01,2.67,these then looking at editing and then analysis.
794.68,2.62,So this is where the query part comes.
797.3,6.75,"And when you look at the next part again this
is where you have visualization again it is"
804.05,4.11,"part of a query and it is a part of a storage
and mapping."
808.16,4.31,"Once you have a mapping both indexing and
querying comes into effect and when you loot"
812.47,6.179,"at both of these finally you also have a security
layers for different types of understanding"
818.649,3.491,or maybe for download maybe for visualization.
822.14,5.88,"So what kind of a query it may be dependent
on not everything every layer would be available"
828.02,2.2,for download but it can be viewed online.
830.22,6.78,"So similarly when integrating both of these
database management system and GIS it would"
837.0,4.649,"have become a very extremely powerful system
in terms of land management or any of those"
841.649,5.201,"management which has spatial features that
is embedded into it."
846.85,5.13,"And most of our todayâ€™s database should
and must have special features in order to"
851.98,2.58,survive in todayâ€™s context.
854.56,6.68,"So we when we go back to some few weeks before
we even spoke about an entity right."
861.24,5.04,"So when we speak about entity it is a separate
portion of the earth surface."
866.28,5.499,"Similarly here in the database entity can
be anything entity can be just a particular"
871.779,1.011,customer ok.
872.79,5.14,"For example if you look at the banking database
entity is just a customer ok."
877.93,8.73,"So when we define entity and entity is anything
that about which a data can be stored ok."
886.66,5.859,"So if you if there is lot of data that is
being generated if there is a particular task"
892.519,1.771,that becomes an entity.
894.29,3.97,"If there is a let us say you are you open
an account ok."
898.26,6.96,"So your name and your name and your address
you are an entity basically and based on you"
905.22,1.54,transaction what is your age?
906.76,1.66,What is your Aadhar number?
908.42,1.28,What is your pan number?
909.7,6.129,"So all of these becomes your different attributes
that are stored are the data that is stored"
915.829,2.461,in this particular entity ok.
918.29,5.88,"So entity is nothing but nothing is anything
that about which a data is to be stored."
924.17,4.39,"Then it consists of certain attributes which
may be assigned certain values as I said or"
928.56,5.18,"your id number, you pan number all these are
attributes to that entity."
933.74,4.18,"Then entity is represented in a form of rectangle
in terms of a database."
937.92,4.84,"For example I am trying to represent a entity
of a customer."
942.76,6.79,"So entity customer is nice said in the form
of a rectangle."
949.55,4.67,"Now when we are trying to look at the relationship
the ER model."
954.22,6.059,"So when I say relation in any association
linkages or connection between the entities"
960.279,1.541,of interest.
961.82,5.829,"Now let us say there is a person who has an
account in bank 1 and has an account in bank"
967.649,1.0,2.
968.649,5.38,"Now maybe that new UID number or Aadhar number
has a linkage for both of these banks ok pan"
974.029,3.301,number also can link both of these banks.
977.33,7.52,"And that link can be set in terms of relations
person A has a account in this particular"
984.85,2.489,bank and also has account in the other bank.
987.339,6.981,"So this becomes the relation between the 2
entities 2 banks where the customer is the"
994.32,5.56,"entity and that particular ER entity has 2
accounts in 2 different banks."
999.88,4.8,"It is two directional normally significant
association between 2 entities or between"
1004.68,3.32,entities and itself ok and itself.
1008.0,3.6,"So you should be very careful when we are
representing it here."
1011.6,3.929,"Normally relationships is represented in form
of a diamond."
1015.529,8.491,"So in the entity is in the form of a rectangle
whereas relationship is in the form of a diamond"
1024.02,1.929,ok.
1025.949,6.151,"So when we look at the entity relationship
diagram this is how normally an example of"
1032.1,1.0,an entity relationship.
1033.1,7.78,"For example a student is a entity here has
its relationship and student ID is an again"
1040.88,1.73,an entity ok.
1042.61,8.35,"So students maybe any students name he has
a particular student id is what we mean ok."
1050.96,2.719,"So relationship is defined in a form of a
diamond."
1053.679,3.531,"Whereas the entities are in the form of a
rectangle."
1057.21,6.49,"So this this is how a entity relationship
is built and entity relationship diagram is"
1063.7,1.87,developed.
1065.57,5.15,"And when we look at the types of entity we
have 1 is to 1 relationship which means there"
1070.72,7.199,"is one particular entity and one particular
relation that is being defined you have one"
1077.919,1.0,is to many.
1078.919,4.21,"For example there is a particular class or
course ok."
1083.129,6.66,"Let us say GIS is a course is being held in
this particular classes ok which means to"
1089.789,7.401,"say that you may have many classes ok many
sessions many modules but the this particular"
1097.19,2.089,course is a single course ok.
1099.279,6.39,"So it is one entity with many relationship
with many relationship many with many entities."
1105.669,6.021,"Now you have many to many also you have multiple
students taking a multiple courses."
1111.69,5.849,"So that means that it is many students has
many different courses or have considered"
1117.539,1.51,many different courses.
1119.049,3.18,So this becomes 3 different types of relationship.
1122.229,5.38,"So the first kind of relationship has 1 is
to 1 relationship which is actually saying"
1127.609,5.45,"that there is one entity one relation is related
to the other entity ok."
1133.059,6.011,"Whereas one is to many is defined between
one entity and many entities a relationship"
1139.07,1.0,that connects.
1140.07,5.959,"Then you have many to many relationship where
you have many entities and many entities that"
1146.029,2.45,are related through various means.
1148.479,4.781,"So that is about the types of relationship
that exists."
1153.26,7.33,"So as I said database language there are various
ways of representing a database languages"
1160.59,6.649,"but when you broadly define the database languages
the database systems are provide two times"
1167.239,2.4,two different types of languages.
1169.639,7.181,"So the one is the data definition language
it specifies database schema by a set of definitions"
1176.82,1.0,ok.
1177.82,6.319,"For example creating a table in the database
is the way of defining a particular database."
1184.139,2.78,How the particular table is being created?
1186.919,2.561,So that is a database definition language.
1189.48,5.379,"We have data manipulation language which can
be used for manipulation such as data retrieval,"
1194.859,7.481,"insertion, deletion all of these are human
quantification and providing qualitative information"
1202.34,2.48,all of these are data manipulations.
1204.82,3.829,"So this is handled by the data manipulation
language ok."
1208.649,5.86,"So when I say language it has series of syntax
and semantics associated with it that is why"
1214.509,1.0,it is called language.
1215.509,5.461,"So we have a data definition language, we
have a data manipulation language ok."
1220.97,6.5,"So both of these languages together becomes
account of a database language ok."
1227.47,6.76,"So the next thing we would look at is a database
management system architecture."
1234.23,6.429,"So when we look at a database management system
architecture we look at this for as 3 tire"
1240.659,1.0,system ok.
1241.659,6.421,"When you look at the architecture the very
important aspect of defining the 3 schema"
1248.08,5.24,"architecture is to separate the user application
with the physical databases."
1253.32,5.169,"So you have user application itself is different
whereas your physical application a physical"
1258.489,4.36,"interface itself is completely different or
the database is completely different."
1262.849,4.401,"So you have to separate both of these that
is why a three time schema is always in used"
1267.25,2.61,in terms of a DBMS architecture.
1269.86,5.369,"Though it has evolved over the period of time
today you can find more complex schemas that"
1275.229,5.2,"are available in terms of defining the architecture
of a database management system."
1280.429,6.6,"But when we speak about basic schema this
is how the database management system architecture"
1287.029,1.051,is defined.
1288.08,1.709,The first one is the internal schema.
1289.789,7.25,"When we look at the internal schema this describes
a physical storage structure of the database"
1297.039,4.82,"that is complete details of a data storage
access path of a database."
1301.859,6.92,"So this actually says that where the physical
storage has been done ok which part of the"
1308.779,1.0,system.
1309.779,5.071,"Where physically the entire data stored ok
and what is the structure of that particular"
1314.85,7.039,"database ok it also tells you how to access
these different data that have been stored"
1321.889,4.88,"in different paths in terms of path storage
or to the database."
1326.769,3.88,"So how do we access how do it stored and where
it is stored?"
1330.649,4.1,"So all of these are provided in the internal
schema ok."
1334.749,6.8,"When we look at the next part of the 3-tier
system it is called as a conceptual schema."
1341.549,5.36,"Conceptual schema describes the structure
of the whole database for a community of users."
1346.909,7.26,"It hides physical storage structures and describes
entities datatypes and relationships and constraints."
1354.169,5.2,"For example if you go into a website it does
not give you what are different ways of store"
1359.369,1.121,your data has been stored.
1360.49,1.279,Where it has been stored?
1361.769,2.9,What are the kinds of data that is available?
1364.669,5.351,"But it gives you a lot of drop down menus
maybe or picking boxes."
1370.02,4.389,"So where in you just select some of these
and use it for your analysis."
1374.409,2.65,"So that is nothing but your concept conceptual
schema."
1377.059,5.98,"Where you do not know how the physical storage
has been done but you only know how do you"
1383.039,1.85,how what are the different dataâ€™s are available?
1384.889,5.35,"How do you access it what are the querying
mechanism and how do you use such a data?"
1390.239,3.581,"Then the third one you have is that external
schema."
1393.82,5.419,"External schema describes a part of a database
that that a particular user is interested"
1399.239,7.05,"in or particular user needs to understand
and includes number of external views or user"
1406.289,1.0,views.
1407.289,4.801,"And when you look at the external schema this
is schema that can be defined based on the"
1412.09,7.15,"user base and can be interacted in terms of
how the user needs it to be manipulated or"
1419.24,2.58,maybe even modified.
1421.82,7.839,"So once you have understood what is the architecture
the next thing that comes here is an attribute."
1429.659,6.491,"So whenever we look at any database so you
have an attribute as a very important factor"
1436.15,2.479,that is defining the entire database.
1438.629,4.951,"Otherwise you do not have database that is
existent if you had just have a customer name"
1443.58,4.799,"in the entire database it is now rather than
called a ledger than a database."
1448.379,2.76,Database should always have an attribute information.
1451.139,5.6,"When I say attribute information these can
be any detail it depends on what kind of system?"
1456.739,1.0,What kind of user?
1457.739,3.48,"What kind of instance you are trying to use
a particular database."
1461.219,3.21,So it can be any detail that serves.
1464.429,8.401,"So to identify, qualify, quantify or classify
or express the state of entity."
1472.83,6.38,"So entity is a very important aspect so and
when it can be on and off it may be colors"
1479.21,2.809,it may be your different types.
1482.019,6.941,"So all of these are defining the identity
qualitym qualifier quality classify, quantify"
1488.96,6.059,"so all of these are an entity that can be
expressed occurring in terms of a relationship"
1495.019,1.421,that is nothing but an attribute.
1496.44,5.219,"Attribute and entity are always connected
through a relationship."
1501.659,5.76,"And this relationship is defined based on
what kind of information that entity is providing"
1507.419,2.39,ok or different entities are providing.
1509.809,6.44,"Then when look at this attribute is represented
using an oval basically."
1516.249,5.05,"For example when we look at it here where
as I previously said the rectangle is representation"
1521.299,2.12,of an entity.
1523.419,5.57,"Now entity is a customer now customer has
an address, customer has a customer ID, customer"
1528.989,5.94,"has a customer name, customer can have Aadhar
number, pan number, customer can also have"
1534.929,6.82,"different details that is required for a like
an maybe an address, alternate address, the"
1541.749,2.92,"mobile phone number which is a very important
part."
1544.669,5.651,"So and your and where the branch is located
so all of these information are attribute"
1550.32,1.0,informationâ€™s.
1551.32,6.199,"So this is what is another part of a database
management system."
1557.519,6.691,"So we have 3 kinds of boxes one is rectangle,
other one is diamond and another one is a"
1564.21,1.0,oval.
1565.21,3.829,"So oval represents attributes, rectangle is
represented by an for an entity."
1569.039,6.2,"And whereas relationships are designed based
on your diamond boxes."
1575.239,6.65,"So in order to summarize this particular class
we first look at the components of a database."
1581.889,4.451,"We clearly define what are different quantum
components of the database though this has"
1586.34,2.12,been previously discussed.
1588.46,6.23,"But we looked at what are the different components
of a database and how it can be of used to"
1594.69,1.0,us.
1595.69,2.719,"Then we looked at what a characteristic of
database."
1598.409,4.98,"Characteristic is extremely important for
any database management system to and to be"
1603.389,1.0,understood.
1604.389,2.89,"If you have not understood what are the characteristic
of a database management system?"
1607.279,4.59,"What type of database management system and
what is its characteristic and probably implementation"
1611.869,4.35,"of a complex database managing capability
may not be there."
1616.219,3.83,"So looking at that the characteristic is extremely
important."
1620.049,4.99,"And when we look at the next we looked at
the entity relationship model we did define"
1625.039,5.24,"the entity as a sole model which is actually
defining any of those information in the data"
1630.279,1.99,"or which is which has data which is connected
with data."
1632.269,1.98,That is nothing but a entity.
1634.249,5.42,"Entity is normally represented in the form
of a rectangular boxes whereas relationship"
1639.669,7.98,"is the one that actually defines or connects
an entity to different attributes or different"
1647.649,5.291,"entities or different ways of maintaining
the database."
1652.94,5.709,"So that is nothing but a relationship so it
has normally in the form of a diamond box"
1658.649,2.2,and this is nothing but the ER model.
1660.849,4.55,"And then we look at the data base languages
we said that broadly it can be classified"
1665.399,4.85,"into two one is the data definition language
other one is a data manipulation language."
1670.249,6.26,"So at the we also looked at the database architecture
what is the architecture of a database."
1676.509,7.29,"We also looked at GIS and a database how different
parts how a GIS and the database management"
1683.799,1.0,system works?
1684.799,4.75,"We looked at how if we take a GIS how the
loading of the data?"
1689.549,4.59,"How the data is then converted into different
features?"
1694.139,3.821,"How the query is done and finally you have
process information."
1697.96,6.23,"Similarly when you look at database management
system this this particular system works including"
1704.19,1.159,the security.
1705.349,6.39,"And when we combine both of these this can
become a powerful engine in terms of any applications."
1711.739,2.971,So then we looked at finally at attributes.
1714.71,7.209,"Attributes are again the part of a database
that we maintain every data has every database"
1721.919,2.6,has a major attribute.
1724.519,4.45,"So when we look at attributes it can be anything
that is linked to the entity and most of these"
1728.969,3.93,"attributes are located in our representative
of a oval."
1732.899,3.5,"So this is what we have learnt in this particular
class."
1736.399,5.24,"So in the next class we will continue this
understanding and we will go further probably"
1741.639,6.97,"we will I will also introduce to terms called
as normalization etc., So which is of extreme"
1748.609,1.0,importance.
1749.609,5.611,"So we will look all those more concepts about
what do you mean by database management system?"
1755.22,5.089,"What is a database different types of the
database in the next class also till then"
1760.309,0.071,have a nice time thank you.
