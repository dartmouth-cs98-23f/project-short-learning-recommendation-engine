0.72,5.36,"Hello and welcome to the video related 
to chapter 10 of the book"
6.08,2.992,Interaction Design: beyond human-computer interaction.
9.072,2.528,The name of the chapter is data at scale
12.56,5.76,"and in this video, we will talk about data 
collection and ethics, and big data visualization."
21.12,4.24,"When we talk about big data we 
mean an enormous amount of data.  "
26.48,7.656,"This data can be collected analyzed and
presented with the support of software."
35.341,6.259,"Big data can be found in many places; 
so there are multiple sources of big data. "
42.88,7.887,"Some of them are presented here and there are social
networks, personal electronics, membership registrations,"
50.858,6.982,"and the world data bank that 
you can find the link in the description of this video.  "
59.04,0.776,Ethics
59.816,11.426,"Oftentimes when we have that big amount of participants, 
we may not be able to ask every single person"
71.242,8.24,"to participate in the research so the participant may not 
be aware that their data are used for research purposes."
79.482,7.767,"In that case, you should always check before you start
 collecting the data with the proper authorities in your country."
88.24,7.6,"Anonymized data are the data that they 
cannot be linked back to an individual person  "
95.84,6.32,"either directly - by naming the person - 
or indirectly - by combining information  "
102.16,7.929,"related to the person like postal code 
date of birth and address, specific address."
111.84,13.668,"Pseudonymous data are the data that can be identified - so they 
have personal information - but this personal information is coded. "
125.569,9.535,"So if someone has the data without the code [then they] 
cannot identify the specific individual that the data are talking about."
135.671,9.979,"In the description of this video, you can find links
 related to data and the law that exists in Sweden "
146.733,3.07,Big data and visualization
151.36,4.88,"In this slide, there is a video - you can find the 
link in the description of the current video -  "
156.88,7.68,"that shows an innovative way of visualization 
of big data and the combination of this big data.  "
166.16,9.677,"Big data are oftentimes hard to visualize and especially 
to visualize a lot of information in one graph, in one picture."
176.231,8.663,"Even if we manage to do that oftentimes people 
- who are not as related to the specific subject as"
184.894,6.089,"the person who did the research is - 
may not be able to understand it"
192.309,11.771,"Another link that you can find in the description is 
a playful type of visualization of a big amount of possibilities."
208.4,3.44,"Thank you for watching and 
see you in the next chapter!"
