lesson 12 types of user interfaces
so this is the 12th of the series of
video lectures for hci
introduction the user interface
has two main components the presentation
language
but is the computer-to-human part of the
transaction
and an action language which
characterizes
the human to computer portion together
both concepts cover the form and content
to the term user interface
the natural language interfaces
natural language interfaces are perhaps
the dream
and idea of experienced users
because they permit users to interact
with the computer in their everyday
or natural language no special skills
are required of the user who interfaces
with the computer using natural
language this is the display depicted in
the figure
so that's below lists three natural
language questions
from three different applications notice
that the interaction
with each seems very easy for instance
the first sentence seems straightforward
at least all the salespeople who met
their quotas this month so the subtilt
is off
and irregularities residing in the
ambiguities of english produce
an extremely extracting and complex
programming problem
attempts at natural language interfacing
for particular application in which
any other type of interfaces is
invisible
say in the case of a user who is
disabled
are meeting with some success however
these interfaces are typically expensive
implementation problems and
extraordinary demand on computing
resources
have so far kept natural language
interfaces to a minimum
the demand exists though and many
programmers
and researchers are working diligently
on such interfaces it is a growth
area and there therefore
merits continued monitoring
some websites such as ask.com use a
natural language for
users to enter their search query when
the query is entered as.com responds
with a list of responses
that matches the question entered by the
user
so question and answer interface
so actually google the google search
engine also
some sort of make use of natural
language
so here are even some examples of
natural language
so here we can see here that
the user just typed change the ace of id
3 to
34 which is very straightforward
so this will change the id the age
of this record with a 93 to 34.
so unlike if you use the real select
statement we're
going to use in you're going to follow a
particular syntax like update
a uh update whatever the name of the
stabilized and set
h equals 34 where id equals three that's
sql so what is natural language if we're
going to look at this
at a glance natural language is actually
a combination of computer science
and linguistics so we have to combine
them
to arrive at our natural language
processes
and of course it requires ai and machine
learning
then we have the question and answer
interfaces in a question and answer
interface
the computer displays a question to the
user
on the display to interact the user
enters an
answer maybe by a keyboard stroke or a
mouse click
and the computer then acts on that input
information
in a pre programmed manner typically by
moving to the next question
wizards used to install software are a
common example of a question and answer
interface
the user responds to the questions about
the installation process such as where
to install the software or
features another common example is the
use of the office assistant with
microsoft products
when the user needs help the office
assistant
asks questions and responds to the
answer with additional
questions designed to narrow the scope
of the problem
users unfamiliar with particular
applications or not knowledgeable about
a topic
may find question and answer interfaces
the most comfortable
and quickly gaining confidence through
their success
so here are examples of question and
answer interfaces so
cc are you sure you want to cancel the
question
so that's already the question so yes or
no
then here we have another key dialogue
so the the page
stock overflow says are you sure you
want to answer your own question
if you're responding to answer blah blah
blah so
we can click ok or maybe cancel
and here's another one welcome to
bittrex environment
setup so then you can click next or
maybe
cancel so these are examples of question
and answer
interfaces menus
a mini interface appropriately borrows
its name from the list of
dishes that can be selected in a
restaurant
similarly a menu interface provides the
user with an on-screen list
of available selections in responding to
the menu a user is limited to the
options displayed
the user need to know the system but
does not just need
to know what tasks should be
accomplished
for example with a typical word
processing menu users can choose
from the edit copy or print options
to utilize the menu best however
users must know which tasks they decide
to perform
menus are not hardware dependent
variations abound
and menus can be set up to use keyboard
entry light pen or mouse selections can
be identified with the number
letter or keyword or users can click on
the selection with the mouse
consistency is important in designing a
menu
interface so here is an example of an
application using a menu interface
so this is actually devc so these are
menu so we have here the main menu and
we have created the secondary options
so menu guidelines
now so to the side menu
so the main menu bar is always displayed
so that should be the first guideline
the main menu uses single words
for menu items so main menu options
always display secondary pull down menu
so if you're going to look at this
this is our main menu and you notice
that it is only using single word
and these are now our secondary options
then the third one the main menu should
have secondary options group
into similar sets of features
so again this is our secondary menu and
notice
it is also grouped
in the features so this is for opening
and saving is for closing the project
this is for import and export so it is
grouped
the drop down menus that display when
main menu
items click open consist of one or
consists of more than one word so if
you're going to
going back at this so
some here are more than one word so
print set up
so we have here close project save
project as save
as so this is the example sub menu so
unlike the main menu which should be
single word the secondary one can be
more than one word
then this secondary options perform
actions or display additional menu
items so if you're going to look at this
so
if you click on this that's why we have
your arrow here that means if you click
on this it will display another
set up new or if you click on open
then this most probably will open a
dialog
open dialog box so it will be performing
an action or it will be opening another
menu just like in this case in new and
so here so these are indicators that it
will open another menu
and then number six menu items in grey
are unavailable for the current
activity so if you notice there we have
here options that are greyed
so that means these are unavailable
so these are some of the menu guidelines
so here's another example bennu so again
single word then here we have read our
drop down
then this will open another menu because
of this arrow here
and the words can be consisting of more
than one word
one word or more and the grade
is actually disabled
form field interfaces or input output
forms
form fill interfaces consist of
on-screen forms or web-based forms
displaying field containing data items
or parameters
that need to be communicated to the user
the form often is approximately of
a paper form already familiar to the
user
this interface technique is also known
as a form based method and
input output forms forms for display
screens are set up to show
what information should be input and
where
blank fields requiring information can
be highlighted with inverse or flashing
characters
the cursor is moved by the user from
field
to field by a single stroke of an arrow
key for instance
this arrangement allows movement
one field backward or one field forward
by clicking the appropriate arrow key
it provides the user good control over
data entry
web-based forms affords the opportunity
to include
hyperlinks to examples of correctly
filled out forms
or to further help and
examples so here's an example the form
field interface
so where we can sign up we have your
text boxes and we appear drop down
then you have your button
here's another example of a form fill
interface
so we have here the uh the labels we
have the
the text boxes we have drop down combo
boxes
and again we have here a button
so form input for this place can be
simplified by supplying default values
for fields
and then allowing users to modify
default
information if necessary for example a
database management system designed to
show
a form for inputting checks may supply
the next sequential check
number as a default when a new check
form is exhibited
if checks are missing the user changes
the check
number to reflect the actual check being
input
input for display screen fields can be
alphanumerically restricted so that for
example
users can enter only numbers in field
requesting a social security number
or they can input only letters where a
person's name is required
if numbers are in our input where only
letters are allowed
the computer may alert the user via
audio output
that will that the field was filled out
incorrectly
the chief advantage of the input output
form interface is that
the printed version of the filled in
form provides excellent documentation
it shows field labels as well as the
contacts for entries
in addition web forms can form
incomplete forms
to the user with an explanation of what
data must be entered to complete the
transaction
often fields with missing data are
marked with
red asterisks web-based documents
can be sent directly to billing if a
transaction is involved
or they can go directly to a consumer
database if a survey is being submitted
web-based forms push the responsibility
for accuracy to the user
and make the form available for
completion and submission on a 24 hour
seven days a week worldwide basis
there are a few disadvantages to input
output forms the main drawback is that
the users
experience with the system or
application will become impatient with
the input output forms and may want
more efficient ways to enter data
then we also have the command language
interfaces
a command language interface allows the
user to control the application with a
series of k strokes
commands phrases or sum sequence
of these three methods it is a popular
interface that is more refined
than those previously discussed the
command language has no inherent
meaning for the user and the fact makes
it dissimilar to the other interfaces
discussed so far
command languages manipulate the
computer as a tool by
allowing the user to control the
dialogue
command language the command language
affords the user
more flexibility and control when the
user employs command
language the command is executed by the
system immediately
then the user may proceed to give it
another command
command languages require memorization
of syntax rules
that may prove to be obstacles for
experienced users
experienced users tend to prefer command
languages
possibly because of their faster
completion time
so here's an example of a command
language interface
we type cmd in microsoft windows
so here we can type here now our
command then we have the graphical user
interface i know you're familiar with
this
so the ketographic graphical user
interface or gui
is the constant feedback on tasks and
accomplishment that they provide to
users
continuous feedback on the manipulated
object
means that changes or reversals
in the operations can be made quickly
without incurring error
messages the concept of feedback for
users is discussed
thoroughly in a later section or later
later video
the creation of guise poses a challenge
because an appropriate modal reality
or an acceptable conceptual model of the
representation must be invented
designing guise for use on internet's
extranets
and more pressingly on the web requires
even more careful planning
by and large the users of websites are
unknown to the developer
so a design must be clear-cut
the choice of icons language and
hyperlinks becomes an entire set
of decisions and assumptions about what
kinds of users
the website is hoping to attract
the designer must also adhere to the
conventions
that users now expect to encounter on
web
sites
so here's an example of a graphical user
interface
so this is actually powerpoint so we
have
menus we have icons
we can have also the pointer
and of course you have the windows
[Music]
so here's another example this is a
browser so we have icons
we have we have here menus here
and then these are now touch screens so
this is our other interfaces so we have
the touch screen
user interface
so the text screens or touch and still
displays
allows a user to use a finger to
activate the display
that sensitive displays are useful in
public information displays such as maps
of cities and their sites posted in
hotel lobbies or car rental facilities
they can also be used to explain
dioramas
in museums and to locate dumping
facilities
in state parks touch sensitive displays
require no special expertise from users
and the screen is self-contained
requiring no special input device
that might be broken or stolen
stylus
the stylus is a small pointed stick that
resembles a pen
it's becoming popular because of the new
handwriting recognition software
for personal digital assistants and
mobile phones
pumps combination mobile phones and pdas
and packet
pcs devices have been a success because
they have
they have because they have are useful
and easy to use
so i don't know how
i think there's something wrong
additionally they are so but
we know that they are useful and easy to
use so additionally they are
portable and sell for a comparatively
low price
there has been an explosion of fun and
useful applications written for these
mobile devices
including popular programs for
restaurant reviews such as sagats
and for popular games such as sudoku
data entry is also facilitated without
ducking
cradle so that you can synchronize data
with your pc
voice recognition
so with voice recognition the user
speaks to the computer
and the system is able to recognize an
individual bulk
vocal signals convert them and store the
input
voice recognition inventory systems are
already in operation
and automobiles now feature voice input
systems that respond to a driver voice
commands to navigate
or to change the radio station an
advantage of voice recognition systems
is that they can
speed data entry enormously and free the
user's hands for other tasks
for example driving speech input adds
still another dimension to the pc it is
now possible to add equipment
and software that allows a pc user to
speak
commands such as open file or save file
to avoid
using the keyboard or mouse users with
limited mobility
or in paid site can benefit from voice
recognition systems
so how do we evaluate user interfaces so
we could evaluate the user interfaces by
the necessary training period for users
and it should be acceptable-ish
acceptably short
then in earlier training users should be
able to enter commands without thinking
about them
or without referring to a help hindu or
manual
keeping interface consistent throughout
the application can help in this regard
the interface should be seamless so that
errors
are few and those that do occur are not
occurring because of poor design
the time that users and the system need
to bounce back
from error should be short infrequent
users should be able to
relearn the system quickly
so that's all for this video so this is
our these are the different user
interfaces
now these are just actually some of
these interfaces that we're using today
thank you very much
you
