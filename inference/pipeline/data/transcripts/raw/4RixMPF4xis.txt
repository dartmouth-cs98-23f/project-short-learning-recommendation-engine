0.74,4.36,artificial intelligence and machine
2.82,4.499,learning what's the difference are they
5.1,6.66,the same well some people kind of frame
7.319,5.94,the question this way it's AI versus ml
11.76,4.56,is that the right way to think of this
13.259,4.561,or is it AI
16.32,2.82,equals
17.82,3.959,ml
19.14,4.92,or is it AI is somehow something
21.779,4.201,different than ml
24.06,3.6,so here's three equations
25.98,4.559,I wonder which one is going to be right
27.66,4.86,well let's talk about this first of all
30.539,3.54,when we talk about AI I think it's
32.52,3.0,important to come with definitions
34.079,4.261,because a lot of people have different
35.52,5.699,ideas of what this is so I'm going to
38.34,5.7,assert the simple definition that AI is
41.219,5.701,basically exceeding or matching
44.04,4.679,the capabilities of a human so we're
46.92,4.86,trying to match the intelligence
48.719,4.621,whatever that means and capabilities of
51.78,3.72,a human subject
53.34,3.539,now what could that involve there's a
55.5,3.62,number of different things for instance
56.879,5.52,one of them is the ability to discover
59.12,5.56,to find out new information another is
62.399,5.4,the ability to infer to read in
64.68,6.119,information from other sources that
67.799,5.941,maybe has not been explicitly stated and
70.799,5.281,then also the ability to reason
73.74,3.84,the ability to figure things out I put
76.08,3.24,this and this together and I come up
77.58,3.84,with something else so I'm going to
79.32,3.659,suggest to you this is what AI is and
81.42,4.559,that's the definition we'll use for this
82.979,4.861,discussion now what kinds of things then
85.979,4.5,would be involved if we were talking
87.84,4.5,about doing machine learning well
90.479,7.021,Machine learning I'm going to put that
92.34,7.02,over here is basically a capability
97.5,3.78,we'll start with a Venn diagram machine
99.36,4.56,learning involves predictions or
101.28,5.339,decisions based on data think about this
103.92,5.04,as a very sophisticated form of
106.619,4.441,statistical analysis it's looking for
108.96,4.439,predictions based upon information that
111.06,4.44,we have so the more we feed into the
113.399,4.68,system the more it's able to give us
115.5,4.68,accurate predictions and decisions based
118.079,4.5,upon that data it's something that
120.18,4.32,learns that's the L part rather than
122.579,3.841,having to be programmed when we program
124.5,3.42,a system I have to come up with all the
126.42,3.3,code and if I wanted to do something
127.92,4.38,different I have to go change the code
129.72,4.56,and then get a different outcome in the
132.3,4.56,machine learning situation what I'm
134.28,4.86,doing could be adjusting some models but
136.86,4.14,is different than programming and mostly
139.14,3.84,it's learning the more data that I give
141.0,3.599,to it so it's based on large amounts of
142.98,3.42,information and there's a couple of
144.599,4.321,different fields within couple of
146.4,4.979,different types there is supervised
148.92,5.16,machine learning and as you might guess
151.379,4.321,there's an unsupervised machine learning
154.08,4.5,and the main difference as the name
155.7,5.22,implies is one has more human oversight
158.58,4.86,looking at the training of the data
160.92,5.039,using labels that are superimposed on
163.44,5.82,the data unsupervised is kind of able to
165.959,5.101,run more uh and and find things that
169.26,3.78,were not explicitly stated
171.06,3.78,okay so that's machine learning it turns
173.04,5.46,out that there's a subfield of machine
174.84,5.7,learning that we call Deep learning
178.5,4.26,and what is deep learning well this
180.54,4.74,involves things like neural networks
182.76,4.5,neural networks involve nodes and
185.28,4.26,statistical relationships between those
187.26,3.059,nodes to model the way that our minds
189.54,3.119,work
190.319,5.64,and it's called Deep because we're doing
192.659,4.86,multiple layers of those neural networks
195.959,3.36,now the interesting thing about deep
197.519,3.72,learning is we can end up with some very
199.319,3.661,interesting insights but we might not
201.239,3.961,always be able to tell how the system
202.98,4.8,came up with that it doesn't always show
205.2,4.98,its work fully so we could end up with
207.78,5.16,some really interesting information not
210.18,4.32,know in some cases how reliable that is
212.94,4.019,because we don't know exactly how it was
214.5,4.739,derived but it's still a very important
216.959,4.92,part of all of this realm that we're
219.239,5.821,dealing with so those are two areas and
221.879,6.0,you can see DL is a subset of ml but
225.06,5.52,what about artificial intelligence where
227.879,5.761,does that fit in the Venn diagram
230.58,6.659,and I'm going to suggest to you it is
233.64,5.64,the superset of mldl and a bunch of
237.239,4.201,other things what could the other of
239.28,5.039,things be well we can involve things
241.44,5.48,like natural language processing uh it
244.319,2.601,could be vision
246.959,3.84,so we want a system that's able to see
249.0,3.84,we might even want a system that's able
250.799,3.241,to hear and be able to distinguish what
252.84,3.299,it's hearing and what it's seeing
254.04,3.9,because after all humans are able to do
256.139,3.78,that and that's part of what our brains
257.94,4.44,do is distinguish those kinds of things
259.919,5.701,it can involve other things like the
262.38,6.539,ability to do text to speech
265.62,5.22,so if we take written words Concepts and
268.919,4.441,be able to speak those out so this first
270.84,5.4,one involved being able to see things
273.36,4.26,this is now being able to speak those
276.24,3.239,things as well
277.62,4.079,and then other things that humans are
279.479,4.861,able to do naturally that we often take
281.699,5.461,for granted is motion this is the field
284.34,4.74,of Robotics which is a subset of AI the
287.16,3.84,ability to just do simple things like
289.08,5.1,tie our shoes open and close the door
291.0,5.16,lift something walk somewhere that's all
294.18,5.1,something that would be part of human
296.16,5.22,capabilities and involves certain sorts
299.28,3.359,of perceptions calculations that we do
301.38,3.84,in our brains that we don't even think
302.639,4.861,about so here's what it comes down to
305.22,4.62,it's a Venn diagram and we've got
307.5,4.74,machine learning We've Got Deep learning
309.84,4.079,and we've got AI so I'm going to suggest
312.24,5.76,to you the right way to think about this
313.919,5.821,is not these equations those are not the
318.0,5.22,way to look at it in fact what we should
319.74,7.739,think about this as machine learning is
323.22,5.94,a subset of a high
327.479,4.141,and that's how we need to think about
329.16,4.68,this when I'm doing machine learning in
331.62,4.74,fact I am doing AI when I'm doing these
333.84,4.919,other things I'm doing AI but none of
336.36,4.86,them are all of AI but they're a very
338.759,4.5,important part
