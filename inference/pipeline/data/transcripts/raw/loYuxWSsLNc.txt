0.56,4.4,data visualization the term just sounds
2.96,4.48,complicated let's make it easier to
4.96,2.48,understand
8.3,4.02,[Applause]

12.32,5.2,hello world mike plogger back with my
14.559,5.761,good pal and infographic genius visme
17.52,4.64,today we're talking data visualization
20.32,3.44,in today's day and age visuals are your
22.16,3.76,best friends when it comes to presenting
23.76,5.279,data spreadsheets powerpoints and
25.92,4.88,lengthy word documents are no more with
29.039,4.161,average attention spans seeming to
30.8,4.72,shorten by the day you must be able to
33.2,3.84,tell your story through data in a manner
35.52,4.16,that's easy for the consumer to
37.04,3.359,understand but how can you do that
39.68,2.64,hi
40.399,4.081,visby and i are here to help and in this
42.32,4.96,video we're going to answer all of your
44.48,5.04,questions regarding data visualization
47.28,5.04,what exactly they are how you can use
49.52,5.039,them different examples and more get out
52.32,5.48,your pen and paper and let's begin
54.559,3.241,shall we
60.399,5.521,let's start with what data visualization
63.12,4.72,is while the term sounds scary a data
65.92,4.32,visualization is meant to make
67.84,4.959,understanding information easier it's
70.24,4.64,just a graphical representation of data
72.799,4.161,rather than presenting data in a complex
74.88,3.68,spreadsheet you can create an image that
76.96,4.4,will illustrate the information in a
78.56,5.04,simpler way viewers don't have to scour
81.36,4.799,a fact sheet looking for the story they
83.6,4.48,can easily scan and quickly find what
86.159,4.241,they're looking for and you don't have
88.08,4.88,to be a data genius to create them
90.4,4.8,anyone and everyone can create them no
92.96,4.32,matter their profession marketers
95.2,4.559,teachers health care professionals
97.28,4.799,consider this infographic here your
99.759,4.881,profession is not an excuse to not
102.079,4.961,create data visualizations you can
104.64,4.64,create so much value for your audience
107.04,6.039,by spending just a little bit of extra
109.28,3.799,time building them
115.92,4.0,i just mentioned creating value for your
117.84,3.279,audience let's dive into four ways of
119.92,3.36,doing so
121.119,4.64,the first reason is how easy it makes
123.28,4.08,data to digest you can write a full
125.759,3.441,report if you'd like and hope that your
127.36,4.08,audience reads it all the way through to
129.2,4.48,understand your point or you can create
131.44,4.56,an infographic like this which is still
133.68,4.639,somewhat complex but simplifies the
136.0,4.8,information in an easy to understand
138.319,4.56,manner imagine if all of this was
140.8,3.2,written in paragraph form
142.879,3.041,yikes
144.0,4.72,the second reason is the ability to
145.92,5.2,discover patterns easier trends emerge
148.72,4.48,from data over time and if you monitor
151.12,4.479,that data through graphics they're much
153.2,4.88,easier to notice scatter plots or charts
155.599,4.801,can help you identify them and then once
158.08,4.64,you do present them with an infographic
160.4,4.72,similar to this one i haven't mentioned
162.72,4.64,this yet but all the examples you'll see
165.12,5.52,in this video are templates you can edit
167.36,4.879,in visme right now so keep them in mind
170.64,4.08,if you've been learning or gathering
172.239,4.801,information for a long period of time a
174.72,5.12,data visualization can help you compile
177.04,4.96,that information into one place it's
179.84,4.64,more engaging and an image is always
182.0,4.64,easier to remember than text alone
184.48,4.56,which is our fourth reason the visual
186.64,4.319,nature of a data visualization helps
189.04,4.16,viewers understand and remember it
190.959,4.401,better they'll soak in that image like a
193.2,4.48,sponge and will be able to recall the
195.36,3.68,information that went with it this is a
197.68,3.44,detailed infographic about
199.04,4.16,bioluminescence in australia the
201.12,4.479,geographical image makes it easier to
203.2,7.72,remember where it's present in where
205.599,5.321,it's not along australia's eastern coast
214.879,3.601,all right we have our feet wet in the
216.48,3.839,data visualization pond let's get a
218.48,4.72,little bit deeper now and explore five
220.319,4.961,ways data visualization can be used one
223.2,4.399,is to plan schedules are you familiar
225.28,4.879,with google calendar well that's become
227.599,4.961,a data visualization you can layout a
230.159,4.881,timeline or project plan for your days
232.56,4.239,or months whether through google or on
235.04,3.44,your own if you're on deadline a
236.799,4.0,visualization showing what needs to
238.48,5.039,happen before the big day is a great
240.799,4.241,idea i suggest starting at the end and
243.519,3.761,working backwards
245.04,4.8,another way data visualization is used
247.28,4.72,is to pinpoint relationships how are two
249.84,4.16,or more things related this is when a
252.0,2.879,scatter plot becomes your new best
254.0,2.799,friend
254.879,4.48,if time is one of the variables in your
256.799,5.12,data a graphic can help share changes
259.359,4.721,over that time period by recognizing the
261.919,4.081,trends from the past your data
264.08,4.48,visualization will help you predict what
266.0,4.479,outcomes to expect in the future
268.56,4.16,frequency falls in line with predictive
270.479,4.401,ability as well after you've compiled so
272.72,4.479,much data you'll have an idea of the
274.88,4.56,frequency you can expect something this
277.199,4.401,will require a lot of research but will
279.44,2.96,be helpful for both yourself and your
281.6,2.0,viewers
282.4,3.44,and our last way that data
283.6,4.64,visualizations are typically used is to
285.84,4.56,interpret value and risk rather than
288.24,4.32,sorting through pages of information a
290.4,4.48,simple data visualization can help you
292.56,4.639,assess a situation and determine if
294.88,4.8,taking action is necessary your brain
297.199,5.121,can process multiple variables much more
299.68,6.84,easily in an infographic than it can in
302.32,4.2,a page full of text
310.08,3.679,all right you've heard me touch on
311.68,4.32,various types of data visualizations
313.759,4.641,already to haunt any confusion and
316.0,6.199,answer any questions let's touch on some
318.4,3.799,of the most popular
324.08,4.16,start with graphs let me preface this by
326.32,3.92,saying there are dozens of graphs you
328.24,4.08,can choose from for the sake of this
330.24,4.64,video i'm only going to share a couple
332.32,4.56,of the most popular pie charts were our
334.88,4.4,best friend in third grade and well you
336.88,4.56,should reconnect after all these years
339.28,4.16,if you have seven or less percentage
341.44,4.72,points and their differences in value
343.44,4.96,are wide use a pie chart they're simple
346.16,4.16,and everyone understands them
348.4,4.239,bar charts are another good example for
350.32,4.48,easily understood data visualizations
352.639,4.4,they mostly speak for themselves and i'm
354.8,3.839,sure you've seen them before again if
357.039,4.321,you're thinking there's no way you can
358.639,4.641,create these visme has your back this is
361.36,5.44,a template right here that you can edit
363.28,5.6,to fit your data right now at visme.com
366.8,4.08,line charts take one fixed value and
368.88,4.319,however many variables and place them
370.88,4.8,adjacent to one another these are
373.199,5.521,perfect to discover trends or to see how
375.68,6.16,one variable may be superior or inferior
378.72,3.12,to another
384.639,4.241,three prominent charts that you can use
386.479,5.28,include pyramid charts stacked area
388.88,4.96,charts and radar charts pyramid charts
391.759,4.72,showcase visual hierarchy they can
393.84,4.24,illustrate income importance or the
396.479,4.72,difference between leads and actual
398.08,5.119,sales as we see here stacked area charts
401.199,4.801,are similar to your line charts they'll
403.199,5.761,visualize changes over different values
406.0,6.08,over time there's not one fixed variable
408.96,5.519,here and the last chart i want to put on
412.08,4.16,your radar is the radar chart you may
414.479,3.84,have also heard these by the name of
416.24,4.0,spyder or web charts but it looks
418.319,4.16,something like this they're great for
420.24,4.799,identifying if something is well-rounded
422.479,5.761,or maybe lacking in one specific area
425.039,3.201,against other competition
430.8,4.959,infographics rely on text a bit more
433.44,3.92,than a standard data visualization it's
435.759,3.601,still kept to a minimum but it might be
437.36,4.64,necessary depending on the type of
439.36,4.8,infographic one example is a timeline
442.0,4.56,infographic these will have some text
444.16,4.96,but you can follow along easier knowing
446.56,5.199,exactly when events were taking place by
449.12,4.639,actually seeing it along the timeline an
451.759,4.241,informational infographic will carry a
453.759,4.481,lot more text and may even feature
456.0,4.639,multiple data visualizations all in one
458.24,4.72,graphic you'll want icons colors and
460.639,4.4,charts but don't overload the graphic
462.96,4.239,and make it too overwhelming keep it
465.039,3.201,organized like we see with this visme
467.199,2.4,template
468.24,3.2,and while there's plenty more
469.599,3.841,infographics to check out which i
471.44,4.319,encourage you to do so for the sake of
473.44,4.72,time i just want to touch on comparison
475.759,4.88,infographics this is for side-by-side
478.16,4.719,comparisons of data helping you or your
480.639,5.28,audience make informed decisions they're
482.879,6.6,great for comparing cars homes or banks
485.919,3.56,as we see here
492.319,4.961,as we near the end of this video i want
495.039,5.28,to leave you with five tips for creating
497.28,4.56,the absolute best data visualization
500.319,4.081,that you can
501.84,4.079,first know your audience understand
504.4,4.239,their knowledge and if they'll be able
505.919,4.321,to comprehend a complex visual or if
508.639,3.84,you'll need to simplify it are you
510.24,4.159,talking to high schoolers or experienced
512.479,4.321,professionals or are you presenting a
514.399,4.481,spider chart to your hr department or
516.8,3.599,your communications team the hr
518.88,3.12,department will recognize it right away
520.399,5.681,because they have more experience with
522.0,4.08,it communications may not
529.519,4.0,that's another reason why you need to
531.12,4.64,choose the right data visualization as i
533.519,4.88,mentioned a pie chart would not be great
535.76,4.8,for data points that are very similar
538.399,3.921,that's when you'd want a bar chart a
540.56,3.92,stacked bar chart is good for comparing
542.32,4.32,maybe two to three variables but any
544.48,5.359,more than that and a comparison chart
546.64,3.199,becomes your friend
552.72,3.44,some quick design tips for you if you
554.72,3.84,follow our channel you've probably heard
556.16,4.4,me say these before but don't use more
558.56,4.56,than three fonts keep the sizing to
560.56,4.719,between 8 and 20 point fonts select
563.12,5.279,colors that are easy on the eyes and
565.279,5.841,complement each other well pro tip blue
568.399,5.041,and purple green and brown blue and gray
571.12,4.96,and green and gray are combos that color
573.44,4.8,blind people can't make out so consider
576.08,2.16,that
581.6,3.6,when reviewer reads a chart they may
583.36,4.4,need a legend to help them understand
585.2,4.16,what exactly they're looking at a legend
587.76,4.0,is what will tell them how to read the
589.36,4.88,chart at the very least they can show
591.76,4.56,what colors mean what like they do in
594.24,5.36,this chart always consider putting a
596.32,3.28,legend along your charts
602.8,4.479,and you know i couldn't end this video
