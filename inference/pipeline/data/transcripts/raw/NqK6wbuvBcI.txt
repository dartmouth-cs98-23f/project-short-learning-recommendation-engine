26.64,5.2,hi guys i'm sure you've all heard the
28.96,4.16,phrases software development and web
31.84,3.52,development
33.12,5.04,and i wouldn't be surprised if you used
35.36,6.24,them interchangeably or even mistook a
38.16,6.399,software developer for a web developer
41.6,4.4,well let me break your bubble they are
44.559,2.881,different
46.0,3.92,so hey everyone
47.44,4.0,welcome to another live session by
49.92,4.639,simply learn
51.44,6.72,today's topic of discussion is software
54.559,5.041,developer versus web developer but
58.16,4.16,before we begin
59.6,6.64,i'd like to thank all our viewers for
62.32,6.24,actively participating in these sessions
66.24,6.199,i'd also like to welcome everyone
68.56,3.879,joining in from facebook
72.96,5.479,so let's wait for a while for more
74.64,3.799,people to tune in
94.079,4.881,at any point during the session if you
96.24,5.36,have any questions let us know in the
98.96,6.32,chat section one of our team members
101.6,3.68,will get back to you immediately
112.32,4.32,so whilst we're at it if you haven't
114.399,4.4,subscribed to our channel already make
116.64,5.36,sure to subscribe and hit the bell icon
118.799,3.201,to never miss an update
125.759,4.401,that being said i think we should begin
127.92,2.24,now
131.76,5.52,so here's what's in store for us today
135.36,3.44,first we'll understand who a web
137.28,3.44,developer is
138.8,4.0,and then we'll see who a software
140.72,4.56,developer is
142.8,5.519,later will compare the two on the basis
145.28,5.039,of their prowess or their skill set
148.319,3.92,the type of product they build
150.319,3.601,product compatibility
152.239,5.28,learning curve
153.92,6.08,job titles and salary
157.519,5.44,and also at the end i'll help you with
160.0,7.12,which career path to choose
162.959,6.0,so moving ahead who is a web developer
167.12,4.32,now a web developer
168.959,5.441,builds and maintains websites and other
171.44,5.28,web applications he takes web design and
174.4,5.28,turns it into a website
176.72,5.599,web developers are responsible for how a
179.68,5.12,website or web application looks and
182.319,5.121,functions from its user interface and
184.8,4.4,page layout to back-end systems for
187.44,3.84,gathering data
189.2,4.88,a web developer is expected to
191.28,5.28,collaborate with clients stakeholders
194.08,5.04,and organization leaders to design
196.56,5.039,unique and engaging websites for
199.12,5.119,businesses non-profits government
201.599,7.28,agencies and anyone else who is looking
204.239,4.64,to communicate more effectively online
209.76,5.119,so diving a bit deeper a web developer
212.4,3.919,can specialize in different areas based
214.879,3.841,on their skill
216.319,4.801,you have the front-end developers now
218.72,4.879,these are experts who are in charge of
221.12,6.24,how websites and applications look and
223.599,6.161,function from the user's perspective
227.36,4.48,next there are back-end developers who
229.76,4.32,focus on the technical aspects of
231.84,3.6,websites and web applications that
234.08,4.799,support both
235.44,5.519,basic and advanced functionality
238.879,4.64,now they largely work on administrative
240.959,5.521,components which include databases
243.519,6.08,website architecture application logic
246.48,6.399,creating new apis and user interfaces
249.599,5.28,based on predefined specifications
252.879,4.241,and lastly there are full stack
254.879,4.161,developers who are professionals
257.12,4.799,responsible for the development of an
259.04,5.28,application from start to finish
261.919,6.481,they specialize in both front end and
264.32,6.24,back end of the application development
268.4,4.88,typically a web developer should have
270.56,6.4,good skills in various frameworks and
273.28,5.6,markup languages like html css
276.96,4.959,javascript
278.88,5.52,react chairs angular and database
281.919,6.321,management systems like mongodb
284.4,3.84,and backend tools like node
288.96,4.56,so i hope this helped you understand who
291.36,4.64,a web developer is some of their
293.52,4.32,responsibilities and their basic skill
296.0,3.04,set
297.84,3.12,next up
299.04,4.48,let's understand who a software
300.96,5.28,developer is
303.52,5.76,now software developers are responsible
306.24,5.76,for creating more complex applications
309.28,4.16,and programs for computers and mobile
312.0,4.639,devices
313.44,6.319,they create conceptualize program
316.639,5.041,document test and upgrade software and
319.759,4.961,their components
321.68,6.079,software developers invent manage and
324.72,6.319,optimize computer programs that run on
327.759,5.201,desktops laptops smartphones and other
331.039,4.081,mobile devices
332.96,5.12,these computer science professionals
335.12,5.6,write complex code that governs how
338.08,4.88,desktop applications function
340.72,3.68,they also specialize in troubleshooting
342.96,3.44,code bugs
344.4,6.079,updating user interfaces
346.4,4.079,creating new tools and much more
350.72,5.44,just like web developers professionals
353.28,4.56,in this field are often categorized into
356.16,3.759,specific roles based on their
357.84,3.76,specializations
359.919,3.84,we have the application software
361.6,3.28,developer and the system software
363.759,3.601,developer
364.88,5.36,now an application software engineer is
367.36,6.16,a professional who focuses on designing
370.24,7.84,specific desktop and mobile applications
373.52,6.88,tools and games for consumer audiences
378.08,4.559,and a system software developer
380.4,4.88,is largely concerned with designing
382.639,5.28,systems level software for enterprise
385.28,4.96,customers rather than the public
387.919,5.041,the software they develop is used to
390.24,4.88,manage corporate network apps database
392.96,3.92,management systems and other critical
395.12,4.0,infrastructure
396.88,3.92,talking about their desirable skills
399.12,4.72,they need to be proficient in
400.8,8.16,programming in the field of javascript
403.84,7.359,java c-sharp php python and ruby
408.96,4.56,they must also have a good understanding
411.199,5.521,of operating systems network and
413.52,3.2,database management
417.039,5.841,so now moving on to the main topic of
419.52,5.92,discussion software developer versus web
422.88,2.56,developer
425.52,6.48,first let's compare the two based on
428.4,6.799,their prowess or area of expertise
432.0,5.759,a software developer is associated with
435.199,4.481,developing products that can be run on
437.759,4.081,multiple systems
439.68,3.359,this product could be any kind of
441.84,3.84,software
443.039,3.841,their area of work includes requirement
445.68,4.72,analysis
446.88,5.84,planning coding testing of applications
450.4,4.56,implementation deployment and
452.72,4.479,maintenance
454.96,4.239,talking about web developers they are
457.199,3.601,responsible for the development of
459.199,3.601,websites
460.8,3.76,they are also expected to follow the
462.8,5.839,process of the software development
464.56,6.4,lifecycle while building their products
468.639,4.4,next up is the type of product
470.96,4.88,now a software developer creates
473.039,4.961,programs for standalone desktop or
475.84,4.72,mobile platforms
478.0,5.36,on the other hand a web developer takes
480.56,5.52,care of the web framework server side
483.36,5.6,functions api integration and the
486.08,2.88,business logic
490.4,4.4,the third point of comparison
492.4,5.04,is product compatibility
494.8,5.119,now software development applications
497.44,5.439,are compatible across multiple operating
499.919,4.881,systems or platforms
502.879,4.32,the web applications on the other hand
504.8,5.839,are designed to be compatible across
507.199,3.44,multiple web browsers
511.599,6.0,next up is the learning curve
514.56,6.479,well software engineering never focuses
517.599,6.0,exclusively on coding however you should
521.039,4.401,know at least a couple of languages and
523.599,3.281,a deeper understanding of how they
525.44,3.36,function
526.88,5.519,some of the languages that you should be
528.8,5.84,proficient in include java c-sharp
532.399,5.281,python and some of its libraries and
534.64,4.48,frameworks javascript and ruby among
537.68,3.76,others
539.12,5.92,a web developer should be familiar with
541.44,5.76,markup languages like html css
545.04,4.16,javascript libraries and frameworks like
547.2,4.24,react and angular
549.2,4.72,you should also have a good hold of
551.44,4.959,back-end frameworks like python django
553.92,5.44,and node
556.399,4.88,the next parameter is a job title
559.36,3.44,now there are different job titles for
561.279,3.441,these professions
562.8,5.039,some of them for software development
564.72,5.119,are software developer software engineer
567.839,4.241,junior software developer senior
569.839,3.281,software developer and a software
572.08,3.52,architect
573.12,5.44,on the other hand a web developer could
575.6,5.679,receive titles like front-end developer
578.56,4.719,back-end developer full-stack developer
581.279,4.961,or just a web developer
583.279,5.441,now of course companies have discretion
586.24,4.64,over assigning these job roles to their
588.72,4.88,employees
590.88,4.32,lastly let's look at the job outlook and
593.6,3.919,salaries
595.2,4.56,now the job growth projections for
597.519,4.0,software developers are even more
599.76,3.36,optimistic than those for web
601.519,4.401,development roles
603.12,5.44,alongside promising job growth software
605.92,5.359,developers also have higher salaries
608.56,5.2,than other it professionals
611.279,6.24,now the average salary of a software
613.76,5.6,developer in the us is around 76 000 us
617.519,4.081,dollars per annum
619.36,4.96,and the average salary of a software
621.6,6.16,developer in india is around 5 lakh
624.32,3.44,indian rupees per annum
628.0,5.839,for a web developer the average salary
630.56,6.399,in the u.s is around 68 000 us dollars
633.839,6.961,per annum and in india it's around 4
636.959,3.841,lakh indian rupees per annum
641.04,3.799,now i'm sure you must be confused as to
643.519,4.401,which one to
644.839,5.881,choose well to be frank it's just a
647.92,5.12,matter of preference if you have strong
650.72,5.679,knowledge of data structures file
653.04,5.68,systems algorithms source control
656.399,4.401,operating and network systems then
658.72,3.6,software development would be a better
660.8,3.599,choice
662.32,5.12,but if you have creative ideas for
664.399,5.761,websites love designing them have a good
667.44,4.8,understanding of html and css and
670.16,4.72,ultimately the knack to integrate your
672.24,5.599,design ideas to create responsive user
674.88,5.44,interfaces then a web development role
677.839,4.481,could be a good career path
680.32,5.28,then web development could be a better
682.32,3.28,career path to choose
685.839,5.201,so with that we end this live session
688.64,4.72,i hope it helped you if you think we
691.04,4.239,missed out on something important let us
693.36,3.76,know in the comment section
695.279,4.081,thank you so much for being here and
697.12,4.64,watch out for more videos from us
699.36,5.96,until then keep learning and stay tuned
701.76,3.56,to simply learn
723.76,2.079,you
