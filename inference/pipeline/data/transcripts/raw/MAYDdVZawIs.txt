0.33,5.266,"So, what is computer architecture. Architecture, in the sense that"
5.596,3.654,"we all know it, is about designing a building that"
9.25,3.402,"is well suited for its purpose. So, it could be"
12.652,3.392,"designing, for example, an apartment building or a house and"
16.044,2.496,what we want is for this building to be designed
18.54,2.368,so that it work wells for whatever you want to
20.908,2.396,"use it. Like, for a family to live in or"
23.304,2.206,for a lot of people to live in. Or if it's
25.51,2.16,"an office building, for a lot of offices to"
27.67,2.04,be there and the employees to be happy and
29.71,4.234,"so on. So, computer architecture is similar in that"
33.944,3.354,it is about designing a computer this time that
37.298,3.526,"is well suited for its purpose. So, we can"
40.824,2.706,"have a large desktop computer, or a much smaller"
43.53,3.38,laptop computer. Or even a smartphone. And we want
46.91,3.92,to design each of these so that they work well.
50.83,2.28,"Maybe the desktop, because it's larger, can"
53.11,3.2,be much more powerful. The laptop provides
56.31,2.59,some computational power in a much more
58.9,3.165,constrained space. And the phone provides us with
62.065,3.233,a good battery life and it's very light weight and still provides us with
65.298,2.014,"some computational power that is enough to,"
67.312,1.948,"for example, do web browsing and so on."
