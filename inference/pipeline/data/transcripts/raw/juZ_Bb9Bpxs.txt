7.839,4.88,hello everyone we have an exciting topic
10.4,4.159,for today and that is data scientist
12.719,3.681,versus data analyst
14.559,3.681,currently all of us are living in an
16.4,4.24,information driven world and
18.24,5.119,organizations rely on data for various
20.64,4.799,decision makings this in turn provides a
23.359,4.401,lot of job opportunities for candidates
25.439,4.24,who can play with data out of the many
27.76,4.16,job roles in the field of data science
29.679,4.88,the two popular ones are that of a data
31.92,4.639,scientist and a data analyst
34.559,4.081,haven't we all wondered at some point as
36.559,4.721,to what the exact difference is between

44.879,3.36,see how in this video
50.879,4.32,we will start off by looking at the job
52.96,4.56,descriptions of both the data scientist
55.199,6.081,and the data analyst then we will look
57.52,5.76,at their responsibilities and skill set
61.28,3.68,we will also have a look at their salary
63.28,3.92,structure and the various companies
64.96,6.32,hiring for these professionals so

73.28,2.24,now
75.76,4.56,a data scientist is a professional who
77.92,4.8,uses different statistical methods data
80.32,4.96,analysis techniques and machine learning
82.72,4.16,in order to understand and analyze data
85.28,3.36,in order to arrive at business
86.88,3.919,conclusions
88.64,4.4,they proactively fetch information from

124.399,4.0,they are sometimes the entry level
126.0,4.64,members into the data analytics team
128.399,4.321,they bring technical expertise to ensure
130.64,4.4,the quality and accuracy of the data
132.72,4.48,then process design and present it in
135.04,4.72,ways to help people businesses and
137.2,5.119,organizations make better decisions
139.76,4.64,after a few years of experience data
142.319,6.081,analysts can move into the roles of a
144.4,4.0,data engineer and a data scientist
148.48,3.839,now that we have understood the job
150.08,3.84,descriptions let's go ahead and
152.319,3.841,understand the various roles and
153.92,5.12,responsibilities of a data scientist and
156.16,2.88,a data analyst
159.68,4.16,firstly data scientists are responsible
161.84,4.8,for performing cleaning processing and
163.84,4.399,manipulation of data using several data
166.64,4.0,analytics tools
168.239,4.481,they also perform ad hoc data mining and
170.64,3.76,collect large sets of structured and
172.72,4.239,unstructured data from a number of
174.4,2.559,sources
177.599,5.041,secondly data scientists interpret the
179.84,5.119,data using various statistical methods
182.64,6.8,they design and evaluate advanced
184.959,4.481,statistical models to work on big data
190.4,4.24,thirdly data scientists regularly build
192.72,4.159,predictive models and machine learning
194.64,5.2,algorithms to work on vast volumes of
196.879,2.961,data
200.64,5.04,lastly data scientists use visualization
203.28,4.8,packages and tools to create reports and
205.68,4.32,dashboards for relevant stakeholders
208.08,4.079,they also work with data analysts and
210.0,4.56,data engineers to formulate the analysis
212.159,3.921,results
214.56,5.44,let's now have a look at the various
216.08,3.92,responsibilities of a data analyst
220.64,4.0,the first responsibility of a data

249.04,4.72,and warehouses through querying they
251.2,6.399,write complex sql queries and scripts to
253.76,3.839,gather and extract information
258.799,4.881,data analysts also filter and clean data
261.359,4.961,to get the required information they are
263.68,4.959,responsible for data mining as well
266.32,4.4,data is mined from various sources and

661.76,6.079,as you see the blue color depicts data
663.839,6.161,scientists and the red data analysts
667.839,4.321,both the search trends go hand in hand
670.0,4.56,and over time the search term data
672.16,4.72,analyst is higher but the search term of
674.56,4.959,that of a data scientist is experiencing
676.88,4.32,a steady rise
679.519,5.041,let's have a look at the worldwide
