2.419,9.571,let's welcome to lecture 16 confidential
6.42,7.11,games there yay
11.99,3.399,computationally game theory is what
13.53,3.509,we're doing today the news of the day is
15.389,3.841,actually a little bit old dated but
17.039,4.111,still relevant checkers
19.23,3.539,this incredibly wonderfully large
21.15,3.42,powerful game that I've played as a kid
22.769,4.891,many who play checkers as a kid gives
24.57,4.26,about solved solve do you like what does
27.66,2.789,that mean I will tell you in this
28.83,3.479,section what solve means what it means
30.449,5.461,for Jonathan Schafer and University of
32.309,4.921,Alberta is that he proved he weakly
35.91,3.809,solved checkers
37.23,4.009,which means he proved if two perfect
39.719,3.781,opponents are playing to God who
41.239,4.84,floating in the in the heavens and
43.5,3.84,they're playing checkers it's only one
46.079,3.151,God okay well I'll do I'm gonna talk
47.34,3.449,outs whatever so if they're to duplicate
49.23,5.399,himself and now that God prisons up and
50.789,7.171,now there always be a draw meaning that
54.629,5.641,these both omniscient entities who knew
57.96,4.2,the entire game tree no one would be
60.27,3.179,able to cause the other one to lose it
62.16,3.42,would buddy draw every single time
63.449,4.831,that's really cool and they proved it
65.58,4.59,they don't necessarily have a path for
68.28,3.33,every possible game that's the
70.17,3.15,difference from what I do and we'll talk
71.61,3.24,about that later bets he weakly solved
73.32,3.03,it which means he proved it but didn't
74.85,3.269,necessarily have the answer for every
76.35,3.15,game I have the answer for every game
78.119,3.241,and we'll show you some demos that do
79.5,3.75,that so today we're talking about
81.36,3.509,computational game theory and this is
83.25,3.6,what the lecture topic is little history
84.869,3.54,definitions so we're on the same page
86.85,4.74,and then I'll show you some demos
88.409,6.721,viewing system that I've built ok so a
91.59,5.76,high up sky level view ten-mile up view
95.13,3.87,of computer sciences there are these sub
97.35,4.32,pieces of computer science and you saw
99.0,4.439,human-computer interaction and next
101.67,3.659,Monday you're gonna hear a lecture from
103.439,3.54,one of our outstanding young graduate
105.329,2.881,student instructors who's going to talk
106.979,2.491,to you about the whole field of
108.21,3.18,artificial intelligence one of the
109.47,4.079,coolest fields of coming up Siri you
111.39,3.6,talk to your phone that's AI and there's
113.549,3.511,a thousand other things that are AI that
114.99,3.419,generally self-driving cars that say are
117.06,2.94,some of the coolest applications that
118.409,2.971,are happening today our AI and she's
120.0,3.899,gonna try to summarize the entire field
121.38,5.55,a very big task but she's up to it so
123.899,4.741,there's all these fields of of computer
126.93,3.51,science and AI is one of them and
128.64,3.45,computational game theory falls under
130.44,3.12,the umbrella of artificial intelligence
132.09,2.88,so similar to
133.56,4.38,what you saw it we go to see in a week
134.97,5.879,from now so you actually it's great
137.94,5.9,the Bjorn talked about the Mechanical
140.849,6.171,Turk and so this is the original
143.84,5.35,Mechanical Turk so this was a a
147.02,5.469,mechanical device in which there was a
149.19,5.25,master level player who hid and when the
152.489,3.811,like the magician who said nobody in
154.44,3.15,here nobody in here he would like move
156.3,3.33,and so it looked like it was an empty
157.59,3.24,box when they showed the players and it
159.63,3.78,turns out there's a person under there
160.83,5.489,who had a magnet to see what the board
163.41,5.57,is above and had a little arm an
166.319,5.67,armature that could control the arm
168.98,4.27,17:70 people they still pooping outdoors
171.989,5.101,and they're getting a chess-playing
173.25,5.79,robot like what are you kidding me like
177.09,4.2,how many there's like centuries in the
179.04,3.809,future right it's like a time machine in
181.29,5.79,today's day uh how does that come here
182.849,6.36,so it played a strong game of chess can
187.08,5.519,you believe it this mechanical this
189.209,4.831,mechanical robot toured Europe and blew
192.599,3.39,people away that this thing could play
194.04,4.949,like how did were they inventing
195.989,5.101,nowadays right and turns out that they
198.989,3.84,challenged Napoleon now Napoleon
201.09,3.69,somebody I would guess if he got
202.829,3.841,challenged and got embarrassed he might
204.78,3.959,not take too kindly to being embarrassed
206.67,4.02,so I'm pretty impressed they challenged
208.739,3.211,a Polina and beat Napoleon but they
210.69,4.41,played Benjamin Franklin two people
211.95,4.95,defeated all of them unfortunately so
215.1,3.66,the idea of this Mechanical Turk is and
216.9,3.69,this is why this name continues today is
218.76,3.449,it looks like it's a machine doing it
220.59,3.69,but it's really humans and that's how
222.209,4.051,they have the Amazon Mechanical Turk
224.28,2.97,idea where you can as a human do jobs it
226.26,2.58,looks like the machines doing it like
227.25,4.29,transcribing a lecture you know the
228.84,3.899,words of audio file but in fact the
231.54,2.4,people are doing it the work that's
232.739,2.34,where this came from see the purpose
233.94,2.699,person's doing their work looks like the
235.079,3.151,machine got that idea
236.639,3.18,unfortunately it burned in a fire but
238.23,2.7,they recover the chess board because the
239.819,2.82,chess board had been stored separately
240.93,3.059,so they saved that but it's kind of cool
242.639,3.481,it's kind of a shame that they lost the
243.989,4.111,original thing we're going the history
246.12,5.28,of game theory this is Claude Shannon
248.1,6.539,one of the founders of signal processing
251.4,5.01,founders of information theory a famous
254.639,3.72,person remember the name I often in my
256.41,3.479,exams I often ask you who was Claude
258.359,3.18,Shannon so make a little circle for
259.889,3.061,yourself to remember who Claude Shannon
261.539,3.991,was he's an important person in our
262.95,4.56,field the double eat there are many
265.53,3.6,fields in the EE side the electric
267.51,4.2,inside of our department in which Claude
269.13,4.74,Shannon is the old the father of that
271.71,4.8,entire field right it's pretty powerful
273.87,6.54,guy so impressive guy he wrote a paper
276.51,7.85,in 1950 that was the seminal work for
280.41,7.38,all computing AI chess-playing programs
284.36,5.2,can can get go back to their origins of
287.79,4.44,that work so he set the foundation of
289.56,5.1,what you what you had to do to create a
292.23,4.71,chess-playing program and all of the
294.66,4.65,current AI programs that play chess well
296.94,4.23,go back to his early work in this
299.31,2.85,incredible guy in fact he has something
301.17,2.82,called a Shannon number which is the
302.16,3.12,number of chess positions and that's a
303.99,2.48,really huge number so that's kind of
305.28,3.42,cool and mathematicians and theoretical
306.47,4.6,and try to get that to be a more refined
308.7,4.83,number and that's a cool thing let me
311.07,5.04,give you a cool historical sense this is
313.53,6.15,like who remembers when this happened
316.11,5.61,here's the thing Wow like three this is
319.68,4.43,such a big deal for the for the field of
321.72,6.72,AI let me just set the context up till
324.11,7.0,1997 chess-playing programs had never
328.44,4.56,beaten a human Grandmaster in a six-game
331.11,3.96,match they had beaten them in a one-off
333.0,3.72,little you know let's do a thing for
335.07,3.36,charity and then oh the computer wins
336.72,3.12,big deal but the computer here but the
338.43,3.0,humans that always said you challenged
339.84,4.26,us to a six-game match and there's no
341.43,5.88,way a program which doesn't have the
344.1,5.55,insight that we do will ever win because
347.31,3.9,humans have intuition where they can
349.65,3.45,limit their search space that ignore
351.21,3.39,massive parts of the board because they
353.1,2.67,know you know if there's a queen and the
354.6,2.91,king and another queen over here in the
355.77,2.97,corner that's where the action is so
357.51,2.76,that's where the next moves will in
358.74,3.27,their mind will go to 20 moves deep
360.27,3.99,incredible 20 moves deep in their head
362.01,3.99,they can see where the computers don't
364.26,2.61,know that and the early computers didn't
366.0,2.34,know that so they're searching
366.87,2.91,everything they're going oh what if I
368.34,3.54,hit the Queen against the wall bonk bonk
369.78,3.48,bonk is that a good thing and then I
371.88,2.28,don't know that you don't hit the Queen
373.26,5.28,against the wall that's silly
374.16,5.88,so okay 1996 so here's the here's the
378.54,3.78,history NSYNC it's a really amazing
380.04,3.6,thing and by there's a video for this I
382.32,3.27,encourage you all to find this video
383.64,4.05,it's on the YouTube there it says deep
385.59,3.9,blue beats garry kasparov 1997 but I'm
387.69,3.21,going to summarize it because I think I
389.49,5.25,do better job today okay so here's the
390.9,5.88,idea in 96 the first game is a six-game
394.74,3.75,match and with every time you win you
396.78,4.14,get a point if you tie it's half and
398.49,5.34,half okay so it's at a total of
400.92,4.8,a purse purse purse first person to
403.83,2.37,after six games has the most points wins
405.72,4.08,okay
406.2,4.95,so the first game that deep blue wins is
409.8,4.89,a classic in 96
411.15,5.25,okay so 96 days IBM thinks well we think
414.69,4.05,we have with all the parallel processing
416.4,4.8,they've built a custom machine custom
418.74,4.68,architecture custom hardware to play
421.2,4.38,chess and do nothing but play chess and
423.42,4.53,it was called deep blue and they
425.58,4.32,challenged Garry Kasparov then the best
427.95,5.61,pretty clearly known as the best player
429.9,6.09,in the world to play chess so deep blue
433.56,4.29,plays this incredible game Game one and
435.99,3.81,wins it's like it still talked about wow
437.85,4.11,that game the deep blue versus Kasparov
439.8,3.72,incredible game like the insight that
441.96,3.06,deep blue saw this really there wasn't
443.52,3.18,much insight and there was a little bit
445.02,3.51,of I'll explain how it works
446.7,3.99,there's an opening book at this some
448.53,3.51,grandmasters head gave given to it but
450.69,2.64,most of its searched most was just
452.04,2.16,brute-force search of different
453.33,4.02,positions in chess
454.2,6.39,okay deep blue loses game three and
457.35,3.72,draws to to lose the six-game match four
460.59,2.25,to two
461.07,3.42,so what that means is they were right
462.84,3.15,humans were right that you're never
464.49,3.06,gonna beat a human in a six-game match
465.99,6.36,but it came close four to two is really
467.55,8.37,close so ACM who is the kind of umbrella
472.35,5.43,organization for computing and IBM say
475.92,4.71,how about hey Garry Kasparov how about a
477.78,5.58,rematch next year and Kasparov says you
480.63,4.83,know certainly in a grandiose way let's
483.36,3.18,do it slaps the handshake BAM I'll see
485.46,4.44,you at the same time next year
486.54,5.49,IBM goes to work and goes crazy and what
489.9,4.22,they do is they study every single one
492.03,4.23,of Kasparov games he ever played
494.12,3.58,Kasparov normally was gonna play faced
496.26,2.55,an opponent will study all the other
497.7,3.03,person other opponents games I've ever
498.81,3.3,played but guess what deep blue had
500.73,2.94,never played games it only played those
502.11,3.42,six games so Casper I've had nothing to
503.67,5.04,work from of the style he was going to
505.53,5.31,encounter so they work and they add even
508.71,5.3,more grandmasters adding all of their
510.84,5.82,brilliance to the mix so now it's 1997
514.01,4.66,again humans had never been beaten it
516.66,3.63,was like the last you know computers are
518.67,4.86,fastest and how many better than us at
520.29,5.79,how many things calculation search tax
523.53,5.07,query all the things but it hadn't like
526.08,5.43,it's kind of like the shores are coming
528.6,4.98,up and we put a big big fortress and
531.51,2.819,sandbags as you can't touch chess
533.58,3.21,there's
534.329,4.44,the human about chess you can't touch it
536.79,5.399,well they shouldn't have done that
538.769,5.16,because in 97 IBM comes back with deeper
542.189,3.3,blue not deep blue deeper like we're
543.929,4.01,gonna search even deeper into the tree
545.489,4.71,so deeper blue very clever name
547.939,6.19,Kasparov wins Game one and here's the
550.199,5.94,key game - he was winning and he could
554.129,3.75,have won but he thinks they did
556.139,3.54,something wrong so he resigns it but in
557.879,3.15,fact the analysis of it was that it
559.679,3.15,should have been a tie or at least he
561.029,3.66,should have won it so he should have I
562.829,3.66,think he should have been a tie okay not
564.689,3.14,a win should've been a tie but he lost
566.489,3.6,so now
567.829,4.841,Kasparov wins one loses one now they're
570.089,6.75,tied one-one right the tied one-one
572.67,7.139,now they draw the next three games three
576.839,4.74,four five so now it's all tied going
579.809,3.861,into Game six who knows baseball
581.579,5.281,metaphors it's like you know tie game
583.67,4.899,bottom of the ninth bases loaded full
586.86,4.5,count you know the whole drama right
588.569,6.33,it's on one game all of humanity rests
591.36,5.009,on one game do you understand how this
594.899,3.66,is how this the pressure and like the
596.369,3.981,fame and it was on ESPN it was a big
598.559,5.791,deal
600.35,5.469,Kasparov the pressure got to him I think
604.35,5.789,he's the greatest player in the history
605.819,6.12,that I know of move seven normally the
610.139,4.17,game is to us how to move fifteen twenty
611.939,3.93,thirty right move seven which is still
614.309,2.49,in your opening book still the set of
615.869,3.39,moves that you normally have
616.799,4.46,pre-recorded in your head but IBM came
619.259,5.67,out with a little twist and Kasparov
621.259,6.76,messes up and move seven and by by a
624.929,5.1,couple moves later he knows it's over so
628.019,4.47,he loses in nineteen moves which is like
630.029,4.56,a blowout and what was it as he lost he
632.489,4.02,lost in the biggest way you could
634.589,5.48,possibly lose to a computer like like
636.509,6.42,that like Skynet had come online and now
640.069,4.781,the computers had taken one more step
642.929,3.84,toward taking away our humanity and they
644.85,4.26,made a whole big drama of this how the
646.769,4.35,how now chess which used to be a the
649.11,4.259,bastion of only humans the computers
651.119,3.39,owned that - what else don't they own
653.369,2.52,right you'll get the feeling that what
654.509,1.711,else don't computers own right a little
655.889,2.85,bit
656.22,5.25,it was the bit it was a defining moment
658.739,4.32,in AI history when they beat Kasparov in
661.47,3.179,that six-game match is an incredible
663.059,3.21,drama behind that and they've never
664.649,3.12,looked back they've gotten only stronger
666.269,2.76,and stronger stronger compute
667.769,4.35,hardware's faster and faster and faster
669.029,5.49,so now on my laptop I have software
672.119,4.62,that's as good as deeper blue was back
674.519,3.36,then custom machine I'm not just my
676.739,2.491,laptop anybody's laptop like the
677.879,2.82,computer hardware is fast enough now
679.23,3.57,that you can have that you're just
680.699,3.721,normal system that you play at home is
682.8,3.149,as good as this thing that beat Kasparov
684.42,3.449,it's incredible what they've done ok
685.949,3.961,it's about how much you we've advanced
687.869,4.08,in our hardware since 97 and it's also
689.91,2.399,incredible that it's no longer even a
691.949,2.04,question
692.309,3.661,you can't be human you paint you can't
693.989,4.56,be computers anymore we're sorry okay
695.97,4.26,they just don't lose you cannot a human
698.549,2.97,cannot beat them that's the feeling or
700.23,4.709,can they
701.519,6.901,game theory is three different pieces on
704.939,5.88,this campus if you say hey you game
708.42,5.459,theory you're probably going to be in
710.819,5.07,the right column economic game theory an
713.879,3.15,economic game theory is the Department
715.889,4.11,of Economics has people who have won
717.029,5.011,Nobel prizes in game theory so that's
719.999,4.171,usually what they mean that means like
722.04,3.599,an auction or a prisoner's dilemma if
724.17,3.149,you've heard of that basically
725.639,4.55,simultaneous moves the goal is
727.319,5.041,maximizing profit very economic right
730.189,4.781,combinatorial game theory is a small
732.36,4.139,subset of computational game theory
734.97,3.719,which is board games like the kind you
736.499,4.38,played it at home okay board games -
738.689,3.63,player board games with no chance that's
740.879,4.17,basically what we're thinking about here
742.319,4.8,there's a small subset that are really
745.049,3.96,cool and really powerful in which you
747.119,3.63,win by getting the last move and that's
749.009,3.27,a really special thing and that's it so
750.749,3.81,there's a small little subset of that
752.279,3.631,but for the most part most of the board
754.559,2.911,games you solve we have to solve with
755.91,4.049,computer horsepower which is why we call
757.47,4.02,it computational game theory or solving
759.959,3.781,board games with computer horsepower
761.49,4.589,which is what I do that's the center guy
763.74,4.349,okay so what board games do you mean
766.079,3.48,well board games that have complete
768.089,3.3,information that is both players have
769.559,3.87,all the information needs to have for
771.389,4.05,that game and there's no chance so
773.429,3.57,there's no dice and no cards any game
775.439,2.82,you have a dice and cards sorry it's out
776.999,3.241,can't come into them can't can't can't
778.259,6.211,play but everything else is in there
780.24,8.67,so go chess checkers not backgammon
784.47,6.959,because that's dice tic-tac-toe
788.91,6.45,I'm hundred others five in a row connect
791.429,5.731,four fellow reverse I Chinese checkers
795.36,3.12,Chinese chess all those things are games
797.16,3.81,that you'd have to use computer
798.48,3.16,horsepower to solve okay and the game
800.97,1.78,can it anyway
801.64,3.48,doesn't have to end with getting a last
802.75,3.51,move as convert or game theory is this
805.12,2.16,is the only math you have to have that's
806.26,1.8,the only part that's a little hard for
807.28,2.73,this the rest was just kind of
808.06,4.65,expositional and tell you how this stuff
810.01,5.21,works so for every position in the game
812.71,4.83,that is every snapshot of the board
815.22,3.88,including whose turn it is on the board
817.54,2.79,so I'll give you a photograph that says
819.1,2.82,here's what the board looks like and
820.33,3.78,here's whose turn it is it's white to
821.92,4.62,play or it's red to play or it's blue to
824.11,5.16,play there's one of four categories of
826.54,4.47,positions it's really simple from the
829.27,2.88,person whose turn it is from the point
831.01,2.67,of view of the person's turn is remember
832.15,3.96,the bottom of the board it says wipe to
833.68,7.05,play so that means for the white player
836.11,6.33,it is either winning which means there
840.73,3.09,exists to move you're assuming always
842.44,4.23,alternating play in this kind of simple
843.82,5.49,game there exists to move a winning move
846.67,4.77,the winning by the way is green there
849.31,4.59,exists a winning move which yields a
851.44,3.9,losing child for you okay this is
853.9,2.76,recursively defined by the way you know
855.34,3.51,you guys know recursion so you can
856.66,5.07,understand this a losing move is one in
858.85,4.56,which all the moves are losing therefore
861.73,2.94,all the moves that you do yield a
863.41,2.49,winning for the other person so there's
864.67,2.55,nothing you can do you're kind of in a
865.9,4.53,corner nothing you can have no way out
867.22,5.52,at I move is one in which there does not
870.43,4.62,exist a winning green guy but there does
872.74,3.96,exist a tie and ties better than losing
875.05,2.97,so you'll take the time move rather than
876.7,3.45,take the losing move so you ignore these
878.02,3.33,bad losing moves on the left of the tie
880.15,2.85,and take the time ooh because that's the
881.35,2.85,best thing you can do and the draw is
883.0,2.58,one in which the game can go on forever
884.2,3.57,like two kings just move it around
885.58,5.34,forever and neither of them can force a
887.77,5.16,move a win or you force the opponent to
890.92,4.17,lose for that okay we care about
892.93,3.96,remoteness also which is how long until
895.09,3.66,the game is over like maton three they
896.89,5.25,would say remoteness is three okay so
898.75,4.98,that's something so I lead a research
902.14,3.93,group and I'm really proud that we've
903.73,4.86,had tons of students who have contribute
906.07,4.53,to this codebase and we now have 70
908.59,5.46,games and puzzles in our system and we
910.6,5.55,strongly solve our art we strongly solve
914.05,3.72,our games and strongly solve means we
916.15,3.45,salt we know the value and we're all
917.77,5.55,done we know the win lose tired draw
919.6,5.7,value for every single position ever in
923.32,4.35,that game it's not just in that
925.3,5.58,particular path but it's for any game
927.67,5.28,ever I know the answer unlike sweetly
930.88,3.84,solving where they've proved it but they
932.95,2.37,don't actually know for every position I
934.72,1.11,know
935.32,1.95,for
935.83,3.96,position that's a big distinction you
937.27,4.2,should make okay so let's go see what do
939.79,5.82,you mean by strongly solved an so let's
941.47,7.92,go see a video so the movie wargames the
945.61,7.35,whopper computer runs amok and starts to
949.39,5.4,try to decode the encrypted key to the
952.96,3.57,missile launch codes if it gets all ten
954.79,5.25,digits it launches the missile and they
956.53,4.98,decide to teach the computer go back to
960.04,3.84,view they decide to teach the computer
961.51,5.01,if I can have the computer play
963.88,4.32,tic-tac-toe and learn that tic-tac-toe
966.52,4.37,it doesn't matter how you start you
968.2,5.49,can't win maybe it will extrapolate that
970.89,5.11,thermal global nuclear nuclear war is
973.69,3.99,like that it's a tie game you can't win
976.0,2.64,it all does matter who goes first okay
977.68,2.94,doesn't matter when it's first strike or
978.64,3.12,second strike you're gonna lose war same
980.62,4.53,as you would never be able to win
981.76,5.69,tic-tac-toe okay it hasn't learned is
985.15,6.23,there I'm going to make it play itself
987.45,3.93,yes number of players zero
1013.649,3.0,damnit
1027.04,7.83,eight assistant
1061.86,5.91,kindly called sack get me in launch
1063.9,7.1,status report late today
1067.77,3.23,give me the president yes sir
1102.13,3.85,make that ground faster all landlines
1104.87,1.92,out of the mountain they're dead I'm
1105.98,3.86,trying to break through all the
1106.79,3.05,satellites okay
1133.7,3.0,learning
1177.47,7.809,and so I leave that in there and pause
1179.999,7.471,that because what is he saying to play
1185.279,7.681,what is that what do you conclude now
1187.47,9.329,about chess either too big to solve
1192.96,6.299,which is the right answer or he might be
1196.799,6.151,implicitly saying that chess is not a
1199.259,4.62,tie game and if he's really smart if the
1202.95,2.339,computer is very smart
1203.879,3.0,it has solved it and it's going first
1205.289,2.88,which means it's giving itself the
1206.879,3.811,advantage and it's gonna win the game
1208.169,3.781,always so it depends whether you read
1210.69,3.329,into this through the script whether
1211.95,3.839,it's not-it's implying that it solved it
1214.019,2.85,or implying that it's hasn't solved it
1215.789,2.88,it's still fun to do because it's too
1216.869,5.91,big to solve it is to be to solve by the
1218.669,5.58,way so how does weakly solving a game
1222.779,3.96,different from strongly solving a game
1224.249,5.01,in the weekly version here's how it
1226.739,4.471,works the game space is too massive
1229.259,4.05,the reason Jonathan Schafer didn't
1231.21,3.539,strongly solve checkers not because I'm
1233.309,3.12,smarter than him but he didn't do it is
1234.749,4.5,because checkers is too big
1236.429,4.83,checkers is way too big too strongly
1239.249,5.191,solve to get to all the dots in there
1241.259,4.89,imagine is a big vessel and up and down
1244.44,3.39,and the y-axis is the number of pieces
1246.149,4.171,on the board you start 24 pieces on the
1247.83,5.579,board and you end with 0 or 1 but one
1250.32,6.539,actually in that one case and so what it
1253.409,5.73,does is it the way he and everybody else
1256.859,4.2,who does weak solving they do a
1259.139,3.9,bottom-up search you start with all the
1261.059,2.37,possible positions for one piece on the
1263.039,1.98,board
1263.429,2.761,we need like you just made a move and
1265.019,2.91,then you back up and say what if it's
1266.19,3.689,one at one versus one and what if it's
1267.929,3.99,two verses one and two versus two and
1269.879,3.601,you keep backing your way up okay so
1271.919,3.33,you're kind of filling the vessel
1273.48,3.929,completely you go through every possible
1275.249,4.65,combination of having those pieces
1277.409,5.85,so you're strongly solving the bottom of
1279.899,4.41,the search space the end games okay they
1283.259,2.971,do this in chess by the way they
1284.309,4.2,strongly solve the end games and you can
1286.23,5.46,now download a chess endgame database
1288.509,5.64,which has all the possible perfect play
1291.69,4.049,for now six pieces and fewer and I think
1294.149,3.931,even they have a seven piece endgame
1295.739,4.591,database available and then what he does
1298.08,4.02,is start from the top and kind of have a
1300.33,2.909,search thing which says well what if you
1302.1,2.519,did this so my I do this and then what
1303.239,3.601,if you do this I do this until you get
1304.619,3.511,down to the endgame and you say okay I
1306.84,2.37,know the answer is there I don't think
1308.13,3.33,searching below that so you basically
1309.21,4.44,saving time by doing that so you have
1311.46,4.2,these workers in parallel trying all
1313.65,5.61,these combinations in order to try to
1315.66,5.19,prove that the game is a tie or a win or
1319.26,3.39,lose and they were successfully able to
1320.85,3.96,do that with checkers so they didn't
1322.65,3.57,visit a whole vast number of positions
1324.81,3.06,in their search space which is really
1326.22,3.54,cool and they will look do that in such
1327.87,3.03,an elegant way to kind of sample the
1329.76,2.64,search space in the appropriate way to
1330.9,4.83,prove that it's a drop
1332.4,5.25,ok so let's actually do that right now
1335.73,3.45,for a game and this is always where the
1337.65,3.21,people who are really paid in to get
1339.18,2.97,this ok focus for a second this is a
1340.86,4.68,game I'm going to teaching you right now
1342.15,5.76,ready go the goal is to player game the
1345.54,3.27,sum the shared some starts at 0 this is
1347.91,3.21,a 0
1348.81,4.83,ducks are on the table and on your turn
1351.12,5.52,you can add one or you can add two ducks
1353.64,5.28,to the table the person at the end of
1356.64,4.35,their turn who after making their move
1358.92,5.37,looks at the table and there's perfect
1360.99,5.76,ten ducks in a row that person wins so
1364.29,4.44,the person that makes the total ten wins
1366.75,4.62,and all you can do is add one or two to
1368.73,5.13,the current running total ok so that's
1371.37,6.57,an example so anna starts with 0 says
1373.86,6.54,i'll add 2 to make it two ducks ok Bob
1377.94,4.44,says I'll add one to make it three ducks
1380.4,5.19,and it says oh I'll add two to make it
1382.38,4.83,five bob says two to make it seven so
1385.59,3.33,you say this is how much I'm adding to
1387.21,3.27,make it the sum and that's the photo if
1388.92,3.9,seven ducks in a row after Bob's move
1390.48,4.47,and it says oh I'm gonna win one to make
1392.82,4.68,it eight and back was ah two to make it
1394.95,6.33,10 and Bob wins cuz Bob made it 10 does
1397.5,7.2,that make sense okay so I want you to
1401.28,6.6,tell me is that is one the game was
1404.7,4.59,called by the one to ten because you can
1407.88,6.69,say one or two and the goal is to ten
1409.29,7.2,okay so is one to ten a first player win
1414.57,4.8,in which if you go first you can always
1416.49,4.2,win our first player lose in which if
1419.37,4.08,you played against a perfect player
1420.69,6.39,you'd always lose going first or is it a
1423.45,9.42,tie or is it a draw so yeah sure right
1427.08,8.62,what's your name says I said you win if
1432.87,5.56,you go first is it Daniel do you think
1435.7,4.59,ah lose go first now it isn't
1438.43,3.45,necessarily what you did but you're kind
1440.29,3.3,of stepping back to see like what would
1441.88,4.29,the perfect person do what would a
1443.59,10.5,perfect player do okay so who wants to
1446.17,10.31,argue whoo yes right in the back well
1454.09,2.39,that's interesting
1457.59,4.15,what's your name
1459.07,8.91,tad well done how did how did you come
1461.74,8.25,up with that it's true if you hit seven
1467.98,4.2,no matter what you do you can always
1469.99,7.8,guarantee when I say you hit it means
1472.18,6.9,you give the other person seven right
1477.79,3.78,right you know what I say you take seven
1479.08,4.71,it means that I make a move to get to
1481.57,3.63,seven but then it's their turn with
1483.79,2.76,seven in front of them that's what I
1485.2,2.94,mean so it's if you're looking at the
1486.55,3.21,board it's your turn in at seven then
1488.14,4.62,that means seven is bad I'm hearing
1489.76,4.83,right so seven is bad because you don't
1492.76,3.3,want to have seven to start from because
1494.59,3.33,if I have seven whatever I do if I say
1496.06,3.33,one you say two to make it ten if I said
1497.92,6.03,to do you say want to make it ten so
1499.39,5.25,seven is bad why seven bad because 10 is
1503.95,3.33,bad
1504.64,5.04,what's 10 if it's my turn in its tendon
1507.28,4.95,I win or lose I lost because the other
1509.68,4.02,person got to 10 the action is getting
1512.23,3.15,to 10 is the winning thing so if I'm
1513.7,4.08,sitting to 10 I got a big goose egg here
1515.38,6.45,so 10 is a losing position
1517.78,6.15,why is 7 also losing because it's the
1521.83,4.62,one it's you can always guarantee to get
1523.93,4.38,from 7 to 10 if you have 7 I can give
1526.45,3.24,you if I if I give you 7 I can arrow to
1528.31,2.46,give you guarantee to give you 10 and
1529.69,3.66,what's that
1530.77,3.93,there's 3 apart and you back up that
1533.35,3.81,means that 4 is losing
1534.7,3.84,therefore 1 is losing exactly right well
1537.16,4.29,done tad all right
1538.54,6.18,is that cool so it is the case that one
1541.45,9.8,is losing therefore 0 which is the game
1544.72,9.78,is winning and what's the winning move
1551.25,5.5,one go first and say one now your
1554.5,4.11,opponent has the losing goose egg of one
1556.75,4.14,and they're also going to have the four
1558.61,3.75,they're also gonna have this 7 then also
1560.89,3.59,you have the 10 which means you've got
1562.36,5.76,to 10 and you won isn't that cool
1564.48,4.78,good stuff right so you guys strongly
1568.12,7.14,solved
1569.26,7.44,one to ten isn't that cool so now you
1575.26,2.87,can all first on a you could always beat
1576.7,3.57,your friends that's kind of cool right
1578.13,5.44,hey let's play one to ten let me go
1580.27,5.07,first one right and you all what's the
1583.57,3.66,perfect strategy by the way can you
1585.34,4.08,summarize this strategy into a couple of
1587.23,3.78,words need to make a big table of if you
1589.42,3.12,have this and I do an instant if you
1591.01,5.34,have this I did it I mean is it the
1592.54,4.83,table based solution or what you might
1596.35,6.44,have like a way to kind of summarize
1597.37,5.42,that somehow how do you get yeah go back
1604.89,5.83,you make that's exemption aim Evan
1608.58,3.34,everyone exactly right you make the
1610.72,3.81,total between you and your opponent
1611.92,5.34,three which is to say you say the
1614.53,5.46,opposite of them you say one I say - you
1617.26,6.03,say - I say one that's three always so
1619.99,5.61,in one sentence go first say one and
1623.29,4.53,then say opposite you will always win
1625.6,4.41,that game isn't that cool
1627.82,4.02,so you strongly solved it and that's the
1630.01,3.12,solution and that solution was really
1631.84,2.19,beautiful because you could summarize it
1633.13,4.86,in one sentence
1634.03,4.92,how about chess chess maybe a win but
1637.99,3.06,you certainly are gonna be able to sell
1638.95,4.44,statisti to summarize a solution in one
1641.05,4.94,sentence right maybe add tie who knows
1643.39,5.18,maybe a draw so here's a game
1645.99,5.71,tic-tac-toe
1648.57,6.22,who's played tic-tac-toe before okay
1651.7,8.25,who's played misere tic-tac-toe before
1654.79,7.65,in which is their french word in game 3
1659.95,5.31,parlance what it means is whatever was
1662.44,5.82,the win or lose is the opposite now so
1665.26,6.5,if three in a row were a win which it is
1668.26,7.74,for tic-tac-toe three in a row is now
1671.76,7.33,I'll lose so three row is now bad three
1676.0,4.71,turnout is now poison you know what
1679.09,3.39,three in a row all the strategies you
1680.71,3.69,grew up practicing you got to like
1682.48,3.39,forget them because you want to not do
1684.4,4.32,that you will not want to get three in a
1685.87,6.12,row right so Wow what is three in a row
1688.72,7.37,now what is sorry what is Miz there
1691.99,4.1,tic-tac-toe win lose or tie
1698.1,5.31,who knows I don't know normal taquito is
1700.53,10.67,that normal tic-tac-toe is a time so
1703.41,10.92,what is misère turns out it's also a tie
1711.2,4.09,but how do you maintain that tie there's
1714.33,2.67,a matter where you go at the beginning
1715.29,2.64,by the way the game of tic-tac-toe is so
1717.0,2.49,cool because it doesn't actually matter
1717.93,3.0,where you go at the beginning you can
1719.49,2.49,keep that tie going any one of the
1720.93,5.58,squares kind of cool
1721.98,7.08,okay how about misère tic-tac-toe well
1726.51,5.1,let's think you never want to go where
1729.06,4.02,what Square has the most things through
1731.61,4.41,it two three in a row that you want to
1733.08,4.5,avoid the middle right so you never go
1736.02,3.33,the middle so it's got to be one of the
1737.58,3.06,edges of the corner well how about the
1739.35,4.35,quarter how many three two rows on this
1740.64,3.9,is the corner three right this way this
1743.7,3.69,way and this way
1744.54,5.46,how about the edge though just two right
1747.39,4.32,so the edges are the better thing to go
1750.0,3.27,through so having the edges and then
1751.71,3.12,maybe if you forced into the corner
1753.27,4.08,let's try it shall we
1754.83,4.65,cyber system here we go let's play
1757.35,4.17,together this is my system that has
1759.48,3.66,strongly solved it and we're gonna see
1761.52,2.25,if we can win come on class you guys
1763.14,3.33,give me a thing
1763.77,3.87,sugar corner or edge edge let's count
1766.47,2.64,them one two nine one two three four
1767.64,2.07,five six seven eight nine ready top room
1769.11,3.39,okay
1769.71,3.78,edge okay so I'm doing so well I'm
1772.5,2.94,pretty good okay
1773.49,3.87,I'm gonna stay with the edge let's stay
1775.44,3.78,at the edge right okay like this one
1777.36,4.08,right it's pretty good yeah okay yeah
1779.22,3.51,all right how about the other end she's
1781.44,2.82,giving the edges to me I love it that's
1782.73,3.57,what I want to go anyway I'm so happy
1784.26,4.23,I'm like rock I'm giving a little shimmy
1786.3,5.52,a little shimmy nananana name I'm doing
1788.49,4.77,my tic-tac show shimmy and then oh okay
1791.82,3.69,well let's see I don't wanna go to the
1793.26,6.06,middle okay and I don't want to block
1795.51,5.46,him so I'll go over here cuz that's
1799.32,2.73,obviously I'll leave this chance for him
1800.97,3.36,to get this is the only way for him to
1802.05,4.08,win for him to lose was the poison there
1804.33,4.42,so I'll go over here and totally rock it
1806.13,5.83,ready there and then
1808.75,4.65,and maybe that was a good place
1811.96,2.49,maybe I well maybe I'll have to go here
1813.4,2.639,cuz I can't go in the middle I'll try
1814.45,6.06,over here I'll go here that'll be there
1816.039,7.89,and then and you start to ask yourself
1820.51,6.029,where did I mess up if only so that said
1823.929,4.98,together class if only we had a system
1826.539,4.921,and or only we had a system that would
1828.909,6.181,be able to tell me perfectly what to do
1831.46,6.78,here well how about value
1835.09,5.459,there's my little stop light and you see
1838.24,4.53,that every that move is bad right that's
1840.549,3.691,a losing move let's undo to find our
1842.77,4.019,green mover I want to find our winning
1844.24,8.1,move so let's undo this where's my green
1846.789,7.081,and yeah okay let's undo again there's
1852.34,6.569,got to be a green back there right and
1853.87,6.75,then let's undo it come on one of those
1858.909,3.981,gotta be perfect let's undo again and
1860.62,2.27,yeah
1864.12,4.36,whoa this is what you call by the way
1866.89,4.23,this is the beginning of the first time
1868.48,4.679,you've seen a research result you
1871.12,5.64,predict a hypothesis that going the
1873.159,5.791,middle is bad you then solve it and your
1876.76,3.87,computer tells you what the surprising
1878.95,2.849,result just like the V that generates is
1880.63,4.169,really cool fractal thing that you were
1881.799,4.921,surprised I was surprised almost the
1884.799,3.271,point of calling home when I found this
1886.72,3.75,result I thought this is the coolest
1888.07,3.75,result I've ever seen in which my Hall
1890.47,3.87,intuition was totally broken
1891.82,4.44,in which the old one square I thought
1894.34,4.38,was the worst place ends up being the
1896.26,4.59,only place that you can keep your tie
1898.72,2.99,and let's see if we can figure out how
1900.85,4.559,to do it ready
1901.71,7.03,let's click there and notice there's
1905.409,4.89,only one place to keep my tie the chance
1908.74,4.919,that I choose that it's very low right
1910.299,8.281,it's one in seven there's only one place
1913.659,7.531,to move to keep my tie there's only one
1918.58,6.99,place to move to keep my tie and it's
1921.19,6.239,always where exactly the opposite of
1925.57,3.81,where the opponent went why is that
1927.429,3.541,because there's two cases of three in a
1929.38,3.24,row there's a three in a row through the
1930.97,4.17,middle and through your oh not through
1932.62,4.11,the middle right agree well they'll
1935.14,4.919,never be a three road through the middle
1936.73,5.79,because if I do that strategy of me in
1940.059,4.201,the middle my opponent and
1942.52,3.93,me that every path of the middle would
1944.26,3.78,be like opponent me me and they'll ever
1946.45,2.16,be me the middle three in a row okay you
1948.04,3.39,agree with that
1948.61,6.06,opponent me me and they'll never be won
1951.43,5.82,on the edge why cuz I'm always the
1954.67,3.87,opposite of my opponent so for me to get
1957.25,3.87,three in a row on the edge would have
1958.54,4.08,met my opponent just got three in row
1961.12,4.95,before me on the edge because I was
1962.62,5.91,copying them in a little mirrored way so
1966.07,4.59,I'll never lose by doing that and that's
1968.53,4.41,the only way to do it isn't that
1970.66,5.22,fascinating and wonderful there's like
1972.94,5.49,beauty is beauty in that search tree in
1975.88,4.77,that tree there's beauty which is that
1978.43,4.41,kind of always the opposite is the only
1980.65,4.29,way to keep that balance of a tie it's
1982.84,6.03,really very cool that's awesome I love
1984.94,5.55,that okay so so you say well that's cool
1988.87,3.21,damn but how do I what's this silly
1990.49,4.53,color thing in my hand you're gonna say
1992.08,4.59,well and those are you online make sure
1995.02,6.33,to download the PDF of this thing okay
1996.67,8.85,so on the outer rim is the value of the
2001.35,6.69,game itself which is a tie and then I
2005.52,3.75,show you the value of the move to that
2008.04,2.7,position remember the picture of Tic
2009.27,3.36,Tacs how I showed you with the yellow in
2010.74,5.19,the middle and red around that I have
2012.63,6.87,nine boxes here the nine big boxes on
2015.93,6.36,bezier tic-tac-toe show you the basic
2019.5,5.19,first move and then you say what if you
2022.29,4.83,were what if my opponent were to go in
2024.69,3.96,the top right let's just think that if
2027.12,3.51,my opponent goes in the top right my
2028.65,4.05,opponent's making a losing move by the
2030.63,4.08,definition going back to like slide four
2032.7,4.14,of game theory if my opponent makes a
2034.71,4.2,losing move I have a winning position I
2036.84,3.45,should be able to win and winning
2038.91,2.94,position and what is is one in which
2040.29,4.35,there exist so when he moved actually
2041.85,5.22,win what is that when he move I don't
2044.64,6.0,know let's zoom in on that box and see
2047.07,5.79,where the green is so that zoomed in
2050.64,3.509,picture is what would have happened what
2052.86,2.67,I would have seen in my screen if my
2054.149,3.331,opponent had moved in the top right I
2055.53,4.98,would have seen those eight boxes why
2057.48,4.8,are there eight because I can't go on
2060.51,3.69,top of my opponent's piece there's only
2062.28,3.6,eight free spots that's why there are
2064.2,4.05,eight squares there and you'll see from
2065.88,4.11,that picture that the only way to win if
2068.25,3.36,my opponent goes in the top right is to
2069.99,4.05,go in on the edges all foragers are
2071.61,4.41,equally valid for a win isn't that cool
2074.04,4.05,so that is the secret
2076.02,3.69,you now have the tic-tac-toe and
2078.09,4.23,brassiere ticked I tell answer key in
2079.71,4.89,your hands which means you can make the
2082.32,3.57,first couple of moves perfectly and it's
2084.6,3.21,up to you to kind of finish the game off
2085.89,3.0,but it'll East gets you down the right
2087.81,3.3,path isn't that great
2088.89,3.42,it might give to you guys so you follow
2091.11,3.21,it up and there's a cool picture and
2092.31,3.57,it's a recursive beautiful fractal
2094.32,4.74,picture and it's beautiful
2095.88,5.01,so to revisit I have a game theory group
2099.06,3.39,it's called games crafters and I
2100.89,3.93,encourage any of you who think this is
2102.45,5.88,cool stuff to come join me I have
2104.82,6.81,projects of all kinds that can even be
2108.33,5.01,relevant and fun and engaging for a cs10
2111.63,3.33,graduate so if you like this stuff come
2113.34,3.51,on talk to me next semester and let's
2114.96,5.22,populate games crafters with more stuff
2116.85,7.11,our group has solved Kinect for like
2120.18,5.04,what my group has solved kind of it's
2123.96,1.77,been done before but never been done and
2125.22,3.12,put online
2125.73,3.84,you now have can go to a website the
2128.34,3.45,website that's on the top of this slide
2129.57,7.53,and you go to that site with your
2131.79,9.57,smartphone and you will never again lose
2137.1,7.98,and connect for did he say never again
2141.36,6.45,yes never again if you go first and
2145.08,6.36,follow my advice of my program never
2147.81,7.02,again lose and connect for in conclusion
2151.44,4.92,game theory the borscht the game trees
2154.83,3.87,are exponential them the word
2156.36,6.15,exponential means it grows faster than
2158.7,6.24,linear cubic and quadratic however so is
2162.51,4.65,computer processing power increasing
2164.94,3.93,with parallelism and all that so what
2167.16,4.05,that means is every couple of years we
2168.87,5.4,gain another move that we can look into
2171.21,5.76,the game tree okay will never that said
2174.27,6.9,will never solve some games like go is a
2176.97,8.31,go search base is 3 to the 361 how many
2181.17,7.86,is that that many positions let's just
2185.28,6.48,keep looking that many positions folks
2189.03,4.17,never in anyone's lifetime in the
2191.76,3.81,history of the universe will you solve
2193.2,4.53,all the positions of go that said you
2195.57,3.54,might have a nice smart AI that will
2197.73,4.65,play it pretty well but you'll never
2199.11,4.38,strongly solve go ok so weak solving
2202.38,3.0,means you prove it
2203.49,4.85,strong solving is what I do which is you
2205.38,2.96,go everything ok
