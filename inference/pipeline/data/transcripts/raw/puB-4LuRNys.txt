2.8,3.28,minutes
4.24,3.44,hi everybody if you're looking to start
6.08,3.36,your career as a computer vision
7.68,4.8,professional from scratch
9.44,4.319,then you are in the right place computer
12.48,3.039,vision or cv
13.759,3.6,is a branch of computer science that
15.519,4.561,empowers machines to see
17.359,3.84,recognize and process images just like
20.08,3.24,humans
21.199,3.92,computer vision is in fact a
23.32,3.4,multi-disciplinary field
25.119,3.521,it could be called a subfield of
26.72,4.959,artificial intelligence ai
28.64,4.88,and machine learning ml computer vision
31.679,3.921,makes use of general learning algorithms
33.52,3.039,and may require the use of specialized
35.6,2.88,methods
36.559,3.601,this diagram shows the relationship
38.48,3.52,between artificial intelligence and
40.16,3.68,computer vision
42.0,4.32,being a multi-disciplinary field of
43.84,4.32,study can seem messy for a beginner
46.32,3.52,the reason for this is some techniques
48.16,3.36,are borrowed and reused from an
49.84,3.12,assortment of engineering and computer
51.52,3.12,science fields
52.96,3.599,understanding the content of digital
54.64,2.72,images is the main objective of computer
56.559,3.201,vision
57.36,4.08,this might seem easy but it's not so
59.76,2.4,because computers are not the same as
61.44,2.32,humans
62.16,3.52,they don't have the gift of vision and
63.76,3.679,perception while seeing and perceiving
65.68,2.4,the world around them comes naturally to
67.439,5.751,humans
68.08,10.88,that's not the case with computers
73.19,8.249,[Music]
78.96,4.24,how do computer vision algorithms work
81.439,2.241,the computer vision algorithms used
83.2,2.64,today
83.68,3.119,are based on pattern recognition they
85.84,4.16,typically rely
86.799,5.041,on convolutional neural networks or cnns
90.0,3.92,computers are first trained on an
91.84,4.319,enormous amount of visual data
93.92,4.559,in this step computers process images
96.159,4.96,and label the various objects on them
98.479,4.881,they also find patterns in those objects
101.119,3.04,for instance if we send a million images
103.36,2.88,of cats
104.159,3.041,the computer will first analyze all the
106.24,2.8,images
107.2,3.199,it will then identify patterns that are
109.04,3.119,similar to all cats
110.399,4.0,and at the end of the whole process
112.159,4.32,create a model cat
114.399,4.161,as a result the computer can accurately
116.479,5.361,detect whether or not a particular image
118.56,5.199,is a cat each time we send it pictures
121.84,4.319,the unprecedented growth of computer
123.759,3.36,vision images dominate the internet
126.159,3.361,today
127.119,3.76,they are everywhere social media
129.52,3.6,ecommerce stores
130.879,3.921,travel sites and more but along with an
133.12,3.92,enormous amount of visual data
134.8,4.48,over 3 billion images are shared every
137.04,4.24,day we also have easy access to the
139.28,2.72,computing power needed to analyze this
141.28,2.959,data
142.0,4.72,computer vision is a booming field due
144.239,4.08,to the latest advancements in this field
146.72,3.519,it's true that the field of computer
148.319,3.601,vision has grown exponentially in the
150.239,3.681,last few years alone
151.92,3.92,new hardware and advanced algorithms
153.92,4.0,have ensured that the accuracy rates for
155.84,3.92,object identification are high
157.92,3.36,in less than a decade the improvement in
159.76,2.4,the accuracy percentage has been
161.28,4.08,phenomenal
162.16,5.12,it's gone up from 50 percent to 99
165.36,3.2,making today's systems more accurate
167.28,3.2,than humans
168.56,4.08,it's an accepted fact that computers
170.48,3.92,react much more quickly than humans to
172.64,4.4,visual inputs
174.4,4.64,the applications of computer vision the
177.04,3.76,earliest experiments in computer vision
179.04,4.32,began in the 1950s
180.8,4.799,computer vision was however first put to
183.36,4.08,commercial use only in the 1970s
185.599,3.441,to differentiate typed text from
187.44,3.519,handwritten text but today
189.04,4.0,computer vision is a reliable and mature
190.959,3.521,technology that generates huge cost
193.04,3.279,savings and saves time
194.48,4.24,from defect detection to intruder
196.319,3.121,detection mask detection to tumor
198.72,3.04,detection
199.44,4.48,crop monitoring to plant monitoring
201.76,2.96,vehicle classification to traffic flow
203.92,2.56,analysis
204.72,3.84,and from customer tracking to theft
206.48,4.08,detection the applications of computer
208.56,3.92,vision are truly varied
