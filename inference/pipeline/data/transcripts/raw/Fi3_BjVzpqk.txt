0.06,5.4,meet Adam an aspiring entrepreneur he is
3.48,4.439,interested in hosting an online store
5.46,5.58,for home decor products like bases
7.919,5.22,curtains artwork and Home Furnishings he
11.04,3.96,requires a software application that
13.139,3.48,would allow the customers to browse the
15.0,3.6,available products at their fingertips
16.619,4.5,and buy them online
18.6,5.099,Adam eager to jump into his new business
21.119,5.461,wanted to understand how the software
23.699,5.34,development process works to start with
26.58,4.98,his business idea Adam meets his cousin
29.039,5.341,Mark who is a software developer and a
31.56,4.86,good one at it he pitches his idea and
34.38,3.96,asks his cousin to help him design an
36.42,4.44,online business application
38.34,4.26,Mark explains to Adam the way of
40.86,4.019,Designing the best online shopping
42.6,3.72,application we need to understand the
44.879,4.86,working of the software development
46.32,5.7,lifecycle also known as the sdlc it
49.739,4.201,involves distinctive phases to initiate
52.02,4.019,the software production based on the
53.94,5.04,client requirements
56.039,6.121,further Mark briefs Adam about the six
58.98,4.86,crucial phases of sdlc in designing any
62.16,4.08,software application
63.84,4.639,planning requirements phase requirement
66.24,4.8,analysis phase designing phase
68.479,5.14,implementation phase testing phase
71.04,4.619,deployment and maintenance phase
73.619,4.381,the development team will commence
75.659,4.14,production post agreeing on the terms
78.0,3.42,and conditions discussed between the
79.799,3.601,client and the development team
81.42,3.18,regarding all the proceedings and
83.4,3.359,requirements
84.6,3.96,initiating the production with the
86.759,3.661,planning requirements phase where the
88.56,3.78,client and the development team will
90.42,4.199,discuss the basic requirements for the
92.34,4.62,software like the purpose of the
94.619,4.981,application the details about the end
96.96,4.799,user of the product key elements like
99.6,4.979,format and attributes of the application
101.759,5.281,for Designing and the overall user
104.579,4.381,interface's design of the software the
107.04,4.38,development moves on to the second stage
108.96,4.799,the requirement analysis phase which
111.42,4.5,includes the detailed information about
113.759,4.801,each element to design the software is
115.92,4.62,discussed validating the installation of
118.56,4.379,elements in the application according to
120.54,4.619,the client's requirements calibrating
122.939,4.021,the security protocols and Performing
125.159,4.08,risk analysis for the software
126.96,4.38,application and all the discussed
129.239,3.841,details are then to be filed in the
131.34,4.92,software requirements specification
133.08,5.879,document also known as the SRS document
136.26,4.86,after completing the second phase third
138.959,4.92,stage of software development the design
141.12,5.1,phase the software designers will devise
143.879,5.041,the system design following the SRS
146.22,5.099,document the system design defines the
148.92,4.26,overall architecture of the software and
151.319,3.0,checks its feasibility with the client's
153.18,3.779,requirements
154.319,4.14,all the details of the design phase are
156.959,4.621,added to the design document
158.459,5.521,specification also known as the DDS
161.58,4.439,document and shared with the analysts
163.98,4.56,and stakeholders for review
166.019,4.381,next the development moves on to the
168.54,4.26,fourth stage the coding or
170.4,4.68,implementation phase in the coding phase
172.8,4.5,the developers start writing the code
175.08,4.98,using the languages they choose for the
177.3,5.46,software development the coding stage is
180.06,4.8,also one of the most important phases as
182.76,3.54,it encapsulates the implementation of
184.86,3.959,the software product
186.3,4.98,the developers use predefined guidelines
188.819,5.041,and development tools like compilers and
191.28,4.5,debuggers to implement the code
193.86,3.84,the next phase of the production is
195.78,4.8,where we begin with the fifth stage of
197.7,5.34,software development the testing phase
200.58,4.5,the develop software is now deployed in
203.04,4.08,multiple test environments to check the
205.08,4.379,functioning of all the attributes in the
207.12,4.38,software architecture after the test
209.459,4.261,cases are completed the quality
211.5,4.62,assurance and the testing team may find
213.72,4.14,errors or bugs in the software which
216.12,5.1,will be forwarded to the developer team
217.86,6.06,for debugging this testing and debugging
221.22,4.98,process continues until the software is
223.92,3.84,stable and works per the required
226.2,4.2,specifications
227.76,4.619,as for the last stage in the sdlc life
230.4,3.66,cycle the deployment and maintenance
232.379,3.961,phase is initiated
234.06,3.899,with the testing phase completed the
236.34,3.899,software application is ready for
237.959,4.801,deployment and consumer use
240.239,4.681,in this phase the development team will
242.76,4.559,set up links for the application and
244.92,4.5,make it accessible to the users after
247.319,4.681,the deployment is completed and users
249.42,4.739,begin using the application they may
252.0,4.32,encounter an error or a bug in the
254.159,3.48,application which is to be solved from
256.32,3.72,time to time
257.639,4.56,maintenance also includes releasing
260.04,4.2,application updates and enhancements for
262.199,3.481,the software for better performance and
264.24,4.739,user experience
265.68,5.1,Adam at this point was surprised by all
268.979,3.78,the effort and steps taken by the
270.78,4.74,development team to design a software
272.759,4.621,application and the key phases involved
275.52,4.14,in sdlc
277.38,4.68,and on that note here's a question for
279.66,4.92,you all what does the design document
282.06,5.28,specification document include software
284.58,5.76,code details on defects and bugs
287.34,5.82,software architecture details software
290.34,4.2,requirements give it a thought and leave
293.16,3.84,your answers in the comments section
294.54,4.5,below three lucky winners will receive
297.0,4.74,Amazon gift vouchers
299.04,5.28,with Mark's explanation of the sdlc life
301.74,4.92,cycle Adam understood how software is
304.32,4.379,developed now he can actively give
306.66,4.259,feedback to the development team and
308.699,5.161,design the best software application for
310.919,5.34,his online store and maybe expand to
313.86,4.8,other businesses as well we hope you
316.259,4.38,found this informative and helpful if
