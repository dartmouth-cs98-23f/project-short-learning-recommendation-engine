7.639,4.241,between data scientist and software
10.139,3.96,engineer don't know which is best for
11.88,4.499,you need to know who gets better paid
14.099,5.221,this video will answer all of your
16.379,4.801,questions people often confuse that data
19.32,3.9,science and software engineering are the
21.18,4.439,same but both are different ball games
23.22,4.44,both have many differences and the role
25.619,3.42,played by a data scientist is entirely
27.66,3.48,different from that of a software
29.039,4.141,engineer after watching this video you
31.14,4.98,will come out of the confusion as we are
33.18,5.219,getting to know in detail what data
36.12,4.38,science and software engineering are so
38.399,4.021,what's in it for you firstly we are
40.5,4.44,going to discuss
42.42,5.1,what is data science after that
44.94,3.84,qualification and career paths to become
47.52,4.32,both
48.78,5.4,salary offered to a data scientist
51.84,5.28,top companies hiring them what is
54.18,5.46,software engineering after that
57.12,5.16,after that qualification and career path
59.64,5.159,to become both top companies hiring
62.28,5.699,software Engineers salary offered to
64.799,5.64,them differences between both data
67.979,5.281,scientist and software engineer
70.439,5.04,after that conclusion to the topic
73.26,5.0,first of all we will understand what
75.479,2.781,data science is
78.6,5.1,data science is the field of study that
81.659,4.261,works with massive amounts of data
83.7,4.62,utilizing relevant tools and techniques
85.92,4.8,to derive valuable data the day-to-day
88.32,4.14,work of a software engineer I repeat the
90.72,3.96,day-to-day work of a data scientist
92.46,4.14,involves collecting analyzing and
94.68,4.14,interpreting this data to help
96.6,4.5,businesses achieve their goals the role
98.82,4.08,of a data scientist is to extract raw
101.1,4.199,data and convert it into meaningful
102.9,4.56,information if we must Define data
105.299,5.1,scientists they are the people who make
107.46,5.28,value out of invaluable data or raw data
110.399,4.801,coming to stages of data science it has
112.74,7.22,mainly five stages
115.2,4.76,first is data collection or acquisition
120.24,4.08,in this stage we basically take out the
122.759,3.9,data which is to be cleaned and
124.32,5.04,processed this data may be in the form
126.659,6.141,of primary data tidy data which can be
129.36,3.44,structured or unstructured for
133.44,3.92,next is data preparation
137.879,4.021,the data collected during data
139.86,4.5,collection is processed or treated in
141.9,4.86,the states raw data cannot be processed
144.36,4.8,directly eliminating inconsistency in
146.76,5.88,data happens in this stage for example
149.16,5.219,removing blank spaces special symbols or
152.64,4.2,anything that is Irrelevant in the
154.379,3.541,column before it get handled for further
156.84,4.979,processing
157.92,6.48,next is data input
161.819,4.741,this stage is defined as the task of
164.4,4.74,coding and converting the prepared data
166.56,4.02,into computer readable data so that it
169.14,3.9,can be processed using different
170.58,4.98,software applications coming to data
173.04,4.26,processing stage this is the stage where
175.56,4.2,we use artificial intelligence
177.3,4.079,algorithms this phase requires the
179.76,3.96,assistance of a data scientist
181.379,4.921,professional who will analyze the data
183.72,4.68,properly and has expertise in AI
186.3,4.32,algorithms
188.4,4.08,and the last stage is data
190.62,4.86,interpretation
192.48,5.399,in this space we have got data which is
195.48,5.039,totally cleansed and it is to be used by
197.879,4.981,the user it can be audio video or
200.519,4.5,graphical data we have understood the
202.86,4.799,fundamentals of data science now it's
205.019,4.86,time to learn qualification to become
207.659,4.681,data scientist
209.879,4.021,basic bachelor degree is enough for a
212.34,3.84,data scientist
213.9,4.619,as a data scientist you need to know
216.18,4.5,about fundamentals of mathematics
218.519,4.261,statistics after that learn machine
220.68,4.86,learning algorithms as well as AI
222.78,4.56,algorithms along with that please go
225.54,4.08,through important programming languages
227.34,6.56,for data science like Python and R
229.62,4.28,practice any of these languages
235.379,4.161,so we need computer science programming
238.56,3.959,languages
239.54,5.559,mathematics and statistics and finally
242.519,5.161,machine learning algorithms to master
245.099,3.901,data science now what is software
247.68,3.419,engineering
249.0,4.799,software engineering is the methodical
251.099,4.86,application of engineering ideas in the
253.799,4.56,development of software planning
255.959,4.5,developing creating and testing the
258.359,4.381,software application to match the
260.459,4.441,requirements are all part of software
262.74,3.959,engineering process it is one of the
264.9,4.44,most popular careers for a reason
266.699,4.861,software engineering is a comprehensive
269.34,4.139,study of engineering applied to the
271.56,4.32,design development and maintenance of
273.479,4.861,soft software Engineers use a variety of
275.88,4.56,programming languages and tools to
278.34,4.74,design test and deploy software or
280.44,4.44,solutions they are in charge of creating
283.08,4.2,and maintaining software applications
284.88,5.16,software Engineers must have the ability
287.28,5.04,to diagnose problems and solve
290.04,4.32,complicated challenges in addition to
292.32,4.26,producing code the need for
294.36,4.44,knowledgeable software Engineers is
296.58,4.339,increasing along with the need for fresh
298.8,4.679,and good software Solutions now
300.919,4.301,qualification needed for a software
303.479,4.44,engineer
305.22,4.8,firstly as a software Engineers you will
307.919,3.361,work on design development and testing
310.02,3.72,of software
311.28,5.22,for that firstly we need to learn about
313.74,5.64,data structure and algorithms after that
316.5,6.0,start to learn coding languages like C C
319.38,5.039,plus plus and Java
322.5,4.74,you will also need to learn about
324.419,4.801,testing tools if you want to become a QA
327.24,4.26,don't be scared any one of the
329.22,5.4,programming languages can be considered
331.5,5.82,no need to learn C C plus plus or Java
334.62,7.04,coming to differences between data
337.32,4.34,scientist and software engineer
344.52,5.34,role played by a data scientist a data
347.58,4.02,scientist main job is to deal with data
349.86,4.5,he is responsible for collecting
351.6,5.28,analyzing and interpreting the data here
354.36,5.279,as a data scientist you work with a team
356.88,5.4,to develop data strategy it requires a
359.639,5.641,lot of algorithms and tools we will
362.28,5.58,discuss the required tools later coming
365.28,5.28,to software engineering
367.86,4.74,a software engineer is responsible for
370.56,4.199,Designing developing testing and
372.6,4.56,deployment of software as we already
374.759,5.16,discussed about this as a software
377.16,4.979,engineer in an organization Your Role is
379.919,4.381,very important in developing a software
382.139,4.141,product a software engineer is
384.3,4.56,responsible for maintenance of the
386.28,4.44,software too now that we understood
388.86,4.14,fundamentals of data science and
390.72,4.259,software engineering it is the time to
393.0,4.68,understand differences between both of
394.979,5.22,them coming to role played by a data
397.68,4.859,scientist a data scientist main job is
400.199,4.021,to deal with data he is responsible for
402.539,4.801,collecting analyzing and interpreting
404.22,5.16,the data here as a data scientist you
407.34,5.04,work with a team to develop data
409.38,5.759,strategy it requires a lot of algorithms
412.38,5.039,and tools we will discuss about required
415.139,4.261,tool later coming to software
417.419,3.84,engineering a software engineer is
419.4,4.62,responsible for Designing development
421.259,5.22,testing and deployment of software as we
424.02,5.7,discussed about it earlier as a software
426.479,5.28,engineer in an organized Your Role is
429.72,4.38,very important in developing a software
431.759,4.56,product a software engineer is
434.1,5.819,responsible for maintenance of the
436.319,5.94,software too next is tools used in data
439.919,6.78,science data science adopts tools like
442.259,5.94,Excel tab blue gz plot to Matlab Apache
446.699,4.44,spark Etc
448.199,5.761,among all these Tableau is simple and
451.139,6.721,easy to learn for larger data sets you
453.96,5.76,may include Hadoop mapreduce Etc
457.86,4.32,went to tools used in software
459.72,5.4,engineering as a software engineer you
462.18,4.799,can go with GitHub opting IDE is based
465.12,4.199,on the programming languages choose to
466.979,5.041,work for instance if you use Java then
469.319,5.341,it's better to choose Eclipse netbeans
472.02,5.76,Etc if you are choosing C plus plus then
474.66,4.86,Visual Studio code and netbeans Etc are
477.78,4.139,preferable meaning to the programming
479.52,5.88,language as a data scientist classic
481.919,6.0,languages used at python or r
485.4,4.199,best preferred coding language for a
487.919,4.921,software developer depends on the
489.599,6.66,application commonly used ones are C C
492.84,6.539,plus plus Java python etc for web
496.259,5.401,development we use HTML CSS bootstrap
499.379,5.581,and JavaScript and for database
501.66,5.819,management we use MySQL postcode SQL to
504.96,5.22,store the data finally in testing we
507.479,4.74,have manual and automation testing but
510.18,4.5,commonly used testing is automation
512.219,4.861,testing now we will understand why we
514.68,4.56,need a data scientist every company
517.08,5.04,deals with lots and lots of data
519.24,4.679,extraction of valuable data is required
522.12,4.62,for the growth of any organization
523.919,4.98,therefore the demand of a data scientist
526.74,4.86,is very high compared to any other
528.899,4.56,position in the market around 1 million
531.6,4.14,jobs are currently available in the
533.459,4.741,world for a data scientist such as the
535.74,5.52,demand of a data scientist
538.2,6.06,so software engineer are responsible for
541.26,5.699,large project with speed and less time
544.26,4.8,so role of a software engineer in a
546.959,3.901,company cannot be negligible at all
549.06,5.219,moving on to
550.86,5.4,salary of a data scientist reward is the
554.279,3.841,result of a good work now we shall
556.26,4.8,discuss salaries that a data scientist
558.12,4.56,will get it should come as no surprise
561.06,4.02,that data scientists may add
562.68,5.58,significantly to a business at the
565.08,6.36,beginner level a data scientist makes 95
568.26,5.699,000 US dollars annually
571.44,5.579,the typical annual compensation for a
573.959,7.201,mid-level data scientist is between 130
577.019,7.44,000 and 195 000 a seasoned data
581.16,7.08,scientist typically earns between 165
584.459,7.861,000 up to 250 million dollars per year
588.24,8.76,depending on the level of experience
592.32,7.8,salary of a software engineer in U.S
597.0,6.6,entry level is 63
600.12,6.0,000 but mid-level is increasing to
603.6,4.98,eighty six thousand dollars to one
606.12,4.56,hundred thousand dollars experienced one
608.58,4.5,can get one hundred thirty thousand
610.68,4.68,dollars it can vary from company to
613.08,4.56,company but we have discussed this
615.36,5.099,average salary in this video coming to
617.64,5.22,salary offered for a data scientist in
620.459,5.161,India in India at the beginner level a
622.86,4.919,data scientist makes rupees 9 lakh forty
625.62,4.86,thousand on average per year at mid
627.779,5.641,level a data scientist will get rupees
630.48,5.7,20 lakhs per inm2 and if you are at
633.42,5.34,advanced level you will get paid an
636.18,5.0,average salary of rupees 25 lakhs
638.76,2.42,annually
641.279,4.441,coming to software engineer at beginner
643.74,5.219,level a software engineer will get
645.72,5.76,average salary as 8 lakhs per year a
648.959,4.741,mid-level experience software engineer
651.48,4.56,will be rewarded with the salary as high
653.7,4.68,as 15 lakhs per year
656.04,5.1,a senior software engineer will be
658.38,5.94,rewarded with a salary of 30 lakhs per
661.14,7.699,year this is according to indeed.com
664.32,4.519,it's time to conclude which is better
668.94,5.339,final question software engineer versus
671.76,4.86,data scientist which profession is
674.279,3.961,better both data science and software
676.62,3.719,engineering requires you to have
678.24,4.2,programming skills while data science
680.339,4.62,include statistics and machine learning
682.44,5.1,software engineer focuses more on coding
684.959,5.101,languages both career choices are in
687.54,4.859,demand and highly rewarding ultimately
690.06,4.74,it depends on your choice of Interest
692.399,4.141,although the field of data science is
694.8,3.779,soaring its importance will never
696.54,4.44,outgrow that offer software engineer
698.579,5.401,because we will need them to build
700.98,4.919,software the data scientists work on we
703.98,4.08,will always need data scientists to
705.899,4.201,analyze the data and bring new scope for
708.06,5.519,the business on which software engineer
710.1,5.4,can build software thus we reach the end
713.579,4.921,of our data science versus software
