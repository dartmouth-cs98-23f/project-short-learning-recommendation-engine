second,duration,transcript
19.789,6.421,our second speaker is tim roughgarden
22.039,6.57,from stanford university and like i said
26.21,6.14,before i'm not you you have access to
28.609,7.321,everything about Tim in your program the
32.35,5.349,rest of the the three speakers remaining
35.93,3.57,are younger than me so I don't remember
37.699,5.221,them from my graduate school but I
39.5,5.97,suddenly remember each of them from the
42.92,7.979,time they were graduate students and Tim
45.47,8.759,Roth Gardens see this sort of amazed me
50.899,5.431,in its generality it's about it's about
54.229,4.26,the price of anarchy I don't know if he
56.33,6.57,is going to talk about this if it
58.489,7.261,doesn't then you should find out since
62.9,5.16,working on the price of Anarchy Tim went
65.75,4.71,on to work on the prices of everything
68.06,6.18,and more generally study economic
70.46,7.97,mechanisms and their efficiency
74.24,10.02,efficiency and computational
78.43,9.25,perspectives Tim also all two books one
84.26,6.02,on an algorithmic game theory and one on
87.68,7.86,on the price of Anarchy I guess that's a
90.28,7.629,book of his thesis if you like his talk
95.54,5.1,like I'm sure we will you should check
97.909,6.991,later he's the website where he has many
100.64,6.24,more talks video talks of his lectures
104.9,3.95,where he explains in much more detail
106.88,5.63,the stuff we talked about today please
108.85,3.66,welcome Tim after
117.159,5.5,check one two okay
119.659,4.74,thanks very much Evie so my goal for
122.659,4.111,today is to introduce you to a few of
124.399,4.801,the many points of contacts between
126.77,4.89,theoretical computer science and game
129.2,3.96,theory and more broadly economics and
131.66,2.31,you know a lot of the times when you're
133.16,2.189,preparing a talk
133.97,2.489,you kind of know most of what you want
135.349,2.881,to say and it's just kind of the
136.459,4.11,beginning it's really hard to figure out
138.23,3.509,like what goes on the first slide but
140.569,3.78,but then when you're giving a talk
141.739,4.711,that's it's about computing it's about
144.349,4.081,game theory at the Institute for
146.45,3.72,Advanced Studies there's kind of like a
148.43,7.71,mandate I think about how you have to
150.17,7.23,start start to talk so it's so what the
156.14,1.65,game theory computing have to do with
157.4,1.8,each other
157.79,3.509,well for starters there was a single
159.2,4.23,individual who have heard of courses
161.299,3.811,here at the Institute who played a major
163.43,2.7,role in the founding of both and of
165.11,2.49,course I'm talking about John von
166.13,3.3,Neumann who we've already heard about
167.6,4.38,and even you know seen the same picture
169.43,5.07,earlier this morning and you know while
171.98,4.05,he had worked out a lot of his theory of
174.5,4.41,games in the 20s in particular his
176.03,4.739,min/max theorem really you know the game
178.91,3.69,theory really became a major subject and
180.769,4.53,started having a lot of influence in the
182.6,4.74,publication of his book in 44 with Oskar
185.299,3.841,Morgenstern and just a couple years
187.34,3.51,later is when he started supervising the
189.14,3.24,development of some of the first the
190.85,3.12,world's you know first computers so
192.38,4.38,first as a consultant on the ENIAC but
193.97,9.18,then also here as also professor Valle I
196.76,8.49,mentioned on the IAS machine and so von
203.15,3.99,Neumann had some common motivations for
205.25,4.14,both of these activities specifically in
207.14,3.629,military strategy and technology you
209.39,2.73,know but I don't think his his work of
210.769,3.181,these two strands really interacted
212.12,4.619,directly that much and indeed as the
213.95,4.08,20th century unfolded well there was
216.739,2.911,tons of progress in theoretical computer
218.03,3.69,science and also in theoretical
219.65,4.08,economics those two communities really
221.72,4.23,didn't interact or communicate much and
223.73,4.289,this talk I really mean to contrast that
225.95,4.14,with the 21st century where there's been
228.019,4.5,a very lively and useful conversation
230.09,4.049,between those two fields but before I
232.519,3.331,fast forward to the 21st century I do
234.139,3.481,want to just point out you know one sort
235.85,4.169,of revolutionary idea from each of these
237.62,4.53,two communities in the 20th century both
240.019,3.511,of which really fundamentally shaped the
242.15,3.71,the research that's preceded it
243.53,5.22,including what I'll be talking about
245.86,5.95,so first on the on the economic side we
248.75,4.709,have Nash's theorem so in the von
251.81,3.629,Neumann and Morgenstern book in 44
253.459,3.421,they're really focusing on two-player
255.439,3.54,games of pure competition
256.88,3.09,okay also called zero-sum games or when
258.979,2.461,there are many players they were
259.97,3.63,thinking about how coalition's might
261.44,3.96,form and naturally founded non
263.6,3.81,cooperative game theory or you can have
265.4,3.78,any number of players and each player
267.41,3.96,acts as an individual in its own
269.18,4.049,self-interest and the games weren't
271.37,3.45,necessarily competitive that could be or
273.229,4.891,they could have aspects of cooperation
274.82,5.31,so this non cooperative formalism really
278.12,4.5,enabled game theory to in principle be
280.13,5.159,double applied to many more situations
282.62,4.29,that had earlier impossible but even
285.289,3.541,better than that Nash's theorem in some
286.91,3.96,sense gave game theorists and economists
288.83,4.35,everything they wanted it gave them a
290.87,4.74,universal existence result namely
293.18,3.989,knowing nothing at all about whatever
295.61,3.57,game you care about just that there's a
297.169,4.201,finite set of players and that each can
299.18,3.66,take on a finite number of actions this
301.37,2.76,game has to have at least one
302.84,3.06,equilibrium point
304.13,5.58,well Nash called it an equilibrium point
305.9,5.67,we now call them Nash equilibria so I'm
309.71,3.48,not going to define that formally I
311.57,3.96,think you all have an intuitive sense of
313.19,5.759,what equilibria look like and that will
315.53,5.73,suffice for the talk pretty much you
318.949,4.021,have a bunch of agents and given what
321.26,3.089,they're doing right now nobody wants to
322.97,4.229,move they're all perfectly happy and
324.349,5.221,staying where they are now the one the
327.199,3.451,one twist may be and in Nash equilibria
329.57,2.76,is you need to allow players to
330.65,2.93,randomize but if you just think about
332.33,3.809,two players playing rock-paper-scissors
333.58,4.99,it is clear you want to be able to allow
336.139,4.321,players to hedge over various actions
338.57,4.05,okay so Nash equilibria a universal
340.46,5.55,existence giving economists in some
342.62,4.799,sense everything they wanted on the
346.01,3.3,computer science side and this is now a
347.419,3.091,couple decades later we have the
349.31,3.359,invention and development of
350.51,5.159,np-completeness by Cooke Karp and Levin
352.669,5.551,so this is something obvious and
355.669,4.441,basically NP completeness was telling
358.22,4.14,computer scientists that were almost
360.11,2.73,never going to be able to get what we
362.36,3.029,want
362.84,4.74,so what a computer scientists want they
365.389,4.261,want efficient computation they want
367.58,3.899,good algorithms for solving fundamental
369.65,3.69,problems what do I mean by fundamental
371.479,3.721,problems well we want to be able to
373.34,3.81,predict how our proteins going to fold
375.2,3.24,so we can do better drug design we want
377.15,1.92,to have more efficient scheduling of
378.44,2.67,airplanes
379.07,4.47,to make better use of airport resources
381.11,5.04,we might want to in a big social network
383.54,4.35,find meaningful patterns and most
386.15,4.32,computational problems of this sort are
387.89,4.02,what's called np-complete and for the
390.47,3.6,purposes of my talk you should just
391.91,4.77,interpret empty completes as meaning
394.07,5.64,very difficult to solve computationally
396.68,5.34,at least in some general purpose way so
399.71,3.66,in other words when a computational
402.02,3.57,problem you really care about is
403.37,4.65,np-complete you've got to be ready to
405.59,4.38,compromise compromise can take many
408.02,3.51,forms and computer scientists have many
409.97,3.66,decades of experience about different
411.53,3.72,ways to do it so for example you can
413.63,3.51,resort to heuristics you can solve your
415.25,4.68,computational problem not exactly but
417.14,4.5,only approximately or you can narrow the
419.93,4.17,domain you can focus on small instances
421.64,4.71,instances with special structure and so
424.1,5.25,forth okay but these do not assuming the
426.35,4.14,P not equal to P NP conjecture that avi
429.35,2.97,mentioned these do not admit
430.49,4.56,general-purpose efficient computation
432.32,4.86,procedures and in some sense theoretical
435.05,5.01,computer science has evolved completely
437.18,4.7,in the long shadow of this widespread
440.06,3.69,intractability and we'll see how that
441.88,5.7,influences the kinds of contributions
443.75,6.51,computer science has made to economics
447.58,5.62,so what I want to do for the most of
450.26,5.63,this talk now is highlights three I hope
453.2,5.43,lustrated but certainly not exhaustive
455.89,6.43,examples of points of contact again
458.63,7.08,between theoretical CS and economics I'm
462.32,5.13,gonna begin with a model which you know
465.71,4.26,the one hand is near and dear to my
467.45,3.42,heart but I also think it remains it's
469.97,2.79,still one of the most vivid
470.87,4.05,illustrations about how in hindsight
472.76,3.75,it's really obvious that computer
474.92,4.2,science and economists had to start
476.51,5.58,talking to each other with the coming of
479.12,4.98,the 21st century so it's a application
482.09,2.52,that involves routing traffic through
484.1,2.52,networks
484.61,3.66,now the reason computer scientists got
486.62,2.97,interested this in the late 90s was
488.27,3.03,they're motivated by communication
489.59,3.78,networks and of course the late 90s is
491.3,3.9,exactly when the internet was exploded
493.37,4.62,so you know engineers have been thinking
495.2,4.41,about routing data for a long time but
497.99,3.09,with the internet really we were for the
499.61,3.08,first time thinking about routing
501.08,4.23,through networks where you had multiple
502.69,4.33,self-interested users like you do in the
505.31,3.84,internet and so that really called out
507.02,4.26,for game theoretic or economic reasoning
509.15,3.329,so that was the motivation but for the
511.28,2.669,purposes of this talk
512.479,2.73,I encourage you all to just think about
513.949,2.94,something you're all probably very
515.209,3.63,intimately familiar with which is
516.889,3.601,vehicular traffic as you're just driving
518.839,3.48,around on roads the fundamental
520.49,5.039,principle principles are largely the
522.319,4.68,same so let me introduce this model just
525.529,3.99,through an example and this is a very
526.999,4.44,old example discussed by ICI pigua in
529.519,5.19,his book the economics of welfare way
531.439,5.31,back in 1920 so in the Bay Area where I
534.709,4.29,live between Stanford and San Francisco
536.749,5.07,there are two parallel highways there's
538.999,4.44,highway 101 and there's highway 280 if
541.819,3.51,it's 4:00 in the morning you should
543.439,4.411,definitely take Highway 101 it's going
545.329,4.92,to be faster when there's no traffic but
547.85,4.019,101 is more prone to congestion okay so
550.249,5.7,it's more it gets it's more subject to
551.869,5.97,congestion effects as it gets traffic so
555.949,3.541,we can have a cartoon of that as follows
557.839,2.91,okay so here's one of the endpoints
559.49,3.509,here's the other these are the two
560.749,4.2,highways each edge is labeled with a
562.999,3.51,cost function think of this as
564.949,4.05,describing the amount of delay incurred
566.509,4.95,by traffic as a function of the fraction
568.999,4.89,X of the population that's using that
571.459,4.35,road at any given time so Highway 280
573.889,3.42,let's just say takes an hour no matter
575.809,4.08,what no matter how many people are using
577.309,3.87,it highway 101 let's just abstract it
579.889,3.721,and saying if an X fraction of the
581.179,3.9,traffic uses it it takes X hour so if
583.61,3.75,half the traffic's on the 101 it's half
585.079,6.271,an hour if everybody's on 101 it takes a
587.36,5.55,full hour okay so the goal was
591.35,4.109,interested in understanding what would
592.91,4.83,self-interested drivers do and whether
595.459,3.06,or not what they did was a good thing or
597.74,2.67,a bad thing
598.519,3.54,so let's first understand you know what
600.41,3.149,do we expect self-interested drivers
602.059,3.9,what do we expect the equilibrium to be
603.559,4.32,and then let's ask could we do better if
605.959,4.98,we hypothetically could coordinate their
607.879,4.38,actions so if you were one of these
610.939,3.0,drivers and you think about it for a
612.259,2.31,second you realize it's sort of a
613.939,2.31,no-brainer
614.569,3.601,what you should do the way I've set it
616.249,3.69,up so every driver has what's called a
618.17,2.909,dominant strategy one action which is
619.939,4.38,always at least as good as every other
621.079,5.281,and that's to take highway 101 the worst
624.319,3.51,case scenario on highway 101 is that
626.36,3.12,everybody's using it then it takes an
627.829,3.901,hour and that's also the best case
629.48,4.589,scenario on highway 280 so there's no
631.73,4.199,reason not to take 101 so at equilibrium
634.069,5.61,the outcome of selfish behavior we
635.929,6.361,expect 101 to be fully fully congested
639.679,4.47,everybody's taking an hour to get from s
642.29,3.359,to T and that's going to be the only
644.149,1.751,equilibrium otherwise people would want
645.649,3.101,to
645.9,5.52,which back from 280 to 101 so is this
648.75,4.17,good or bad so it turns out this is an
651.42,3.39,illustration of what an economist would
652.92,3.38,call the congestion externality it turns
654.81,4.02,out you could do better than this
656.3,4.27,equilibrium and that's the and the
658.83,3.69,reason it's inefficient is because
660.57,3.95,drivers don't take into account the
662.52,5.43,extra congestion their presence causes
664.52,5.14,for other users of the edge so in fact
667.95,3.96,any other traffic pattern when in some
669.66,4.68,sense be better than that green one but
671.91,4.23,an altruistic dictator if who could
674.34,3.87,hypothetically control everybody's
676.14,4.35,routes would be wise to split the
678.21,4.59,traffic fifty-fifty okay between 101 and
680.49,3.63,280 now the drivers on to idiot takes
682.8,3.6,them an hour just what it took them
684.12,3.84,before but the drivers on 101 get there
686.4,3.06,pretty quickly just a half an hour so
687.96,4.17,the average commute time has dropped
689.46,5.64,from 60 minutes in the green traffic
692.13,4.98,pattern to 45 minutes in the red traffic
695.1,4.02,pattern okay so that shows you something
697.11,3.75,which in hindsight is not surprising you
699.12,4.28,let people do whatever they want the
700.86,4.56,outcome need not be what's an altruistic
703.4,5.32,dictator would have been posed on the
705.42,4.95,system and so to measure this cost of
708.72,3.75,selfish behavior could sue Pearson pop
710.37,4.32,dimitru introduced the colorful phrase
712.47,4.29,the price of Anarchy and as a
714.69,4.86,mathematical definition that's nothing
716.76,5.19,but the old commute I'm the equilibrium
719.55,4.38,average delay compared to this optimal
721.95,5.25,ie minimum possible delay ie
723.93,4.74,60 over 45 ie 4/3
727.2,5.67,okay so we'd say the price of Anarchy in
728.67,8.19,pig news example is 4 over 3 there's a
732.87,5.67,more well-known example of this routing
736.86,3.18,network which is sort of you know
738.54,3.54,popular it's sort of a good thing to
740.04,4.7,know the cocktail party at least if it's
742.08,4.95,a sufficiently nerdy cocktail party so
744.74,5.53,is there something called braces paradox
747.03,5.22,this is from 1968 and so here's our
750.27,4.08,initial network so again we have one
752.25,4.26,origin one destination two parallel
754.35,3.66,routes one an X means the same thing as
756.51,3.54,before so one that always takes an hour
758.01,4.14,X it takes proportional to the amount of
760.05,4.32,traffic that are using it now by
762.15,4.08,symmetry at equilibrium the drivers will
764.37,3.06,just load balanced ok those there's no
766.23,3.39,reason to prefer one route over the
767.43,4.05,other so those split 50/50 and the
769.62,4.92,commute time will be 90 minutes each way
771.48,3.6,so it seems pretty boring where's the
774.54,3.66,paradox
775.08,3.76,well the paradox emerges you know
778.2,2.53,suppose
778.84,4.38,Google X announces that the newest
780.73,4.76,technology invention is a teleportation
783.22,2.27,device
788.399,4.05,midpoint of the Bock map and moreover it
790.889,5.041,has infinite capacity any number of
792.449,5.37,people can use it so what effect does
795.93,4.079,this have on the network well suppose
797.819,4.231,you're one of these drivers it's a
800.009,3.781,no-brainer to use the teleportation
802.05,3.63,device okay so if everybody else stays
803.79,3.719,the same it used to take you an hour and
805.68,3.449,a half now it's gonna take you 30 plus
807.509,3.411,zero plus 30 minutes that's an hour
809.129,4.531,there's at 60 minutes 30 minutes
810.92,4.0,improvement Goris you know you're not
813.66,4.589,the only one thinking this way
814.92,5.399,so actually you expect everybody to make
818.249,4.111,use of this new technology so the new
820.319,5.25,equilibrium after adding the teleporter
822.36,4.949,has everybody on the zigzag path as a
825.569,3.63,consequence the congestion on the upper
827.309,3.51,left and lower right edges they're now
829.199,3.661,fully congested they take an hour each
830.819,6.12,so the commute times actually gone up
832.86,5.399,from 90 minutes to 120 and this is
836.939,3.09,actually the unique equilibrium in this
838.259,4.111,new network it's again the case that the
840.029,5.37,zigzag path individually is a no-brainer
842.37,4.5,strategy a dominant strategy so this is
845.399,2.73,the paradox that when you're dealing
846.87,3.149,with selfish individuals when you're
848.129,4.291,looking at equilibria you intuitively
850.019,3.271,can only add resources make a network
852.42,2.969,only better
853.29,4.229,and yet the outcome is somehow worse for
855.389,3.99,everybody you'll notice that if we think
857.519,3.42,about the price of Anarchy in the second
859.379,3.63,network so what would be the difference
860.939,4.77,between selfish behavior and the
863.009,5.341,altruistic dictator it's again four over
865.709,4.29,three and that's because and even in
868.35,3.179,this new network there's actually no way
869.999,4.351,to make use of the new teleportation
871.529,4.711,device to improve the traffic okay so
874.35,5.399,we'll explain that coincidence of the
876.24,5.099,second four over three in a second so
879.749,3.301,one thing I'll point out given that it's
881.339,3.84,a this is sort of general science
883.05,3.81,audience is it braces paradoxes
885.179,3.15,innocence I've shown it to you as a
886.86,3.87,phenomena in traffic networks but it's
888.329,3.87,actually something much more basic the
890.73,3.0,same equations that govern the
892.199,3.3,equilibria of these traffic networks
893.73,3.63,also govern the many other notions of
895.499,4.56,equilibria like physical equilibria
897.36,4.529,so you can for example and I've had
900.059,3.87,classes of mine students of mine do this
901.889,5.221,for extra credit you can take a bunch of
903.929,4.38,strings and a bunch of springs and you
907.11,2.789,can tie these strings and Springs
908.309,4.051,together into a physical contraption
909.899,3.87,okay and you hang the top of the strings
912.36,2.639,and Springs you know from the from some
913.769,3.271,heavy weight you know at the bottom of
914.999,4.08,the table and then you hang a weight
917.04,3.57,from the bottom okay so that stretches
919.079,2.161,everything out right the weight exerts
920.61,2.34,force
921.24,3.81,stretches out the string stretches out
922.95,5.31,the springs and if you build that just
925.05,5.37,so you can take a pair of scissors snip
928.26,4.17,a taut string from the middle of this
930.42,4.71,contraption intuitively weakening it and
932.43,5.07,yet that weight will levitate further
935.13,3.69,off of the ground you can really
937.5,3.149,demonstrate this search for braces
938.82,4.04,paradox on YouTube you'll get some extra
940.649,4.081,credit projects from my graduate courses
942.86,3.669,now why does that happen
944.73,4.049,one reason so one reason would just be
946.529,4.321,it's just braces paradox the equilibrium
948.779,5.101,is governed by the exact same equations
950.85,5.9,the correspondences in elastic strings
953.88,5.87,correspond to these constants 1 0 & 1
956.75,6.06,elastic Springs correspond to the X
959.75,6.279,travel time corresponds to distance and
962.81,5.469,the flow corresponds to force ok so
966.029,5.191,cutting the taut string just corresponds
968.279,5.221,to deleting the zero edge and recovering
971.22,4.41,the original network a way to see it
973.5,4.41,directly is that when you cut that taut
975.63,5.22,string what really happens is it frees
977.91,5.489,up two Springs to carry awaits in
980.85,4.44,parallel ok so to share it the force
983.399,3.961,that it exerts rather than being forced
985.29,5.19,to carry the weights exerted the force
987.36,5.49,exerted by the weights in series okay so
990.48,4.29,it allows two Springs to share the load
992.85,4.77,as opposed to each bearing the fulcrum
994.77,5.91,brunt of the exhorted force so that's
997.62,5.88,Bryce's paradox now let's try to think
1000.68,4.409,about you know we've seen these lower
1003.5,3.75,bounds on how inefficient things could
1005.089,3.841,be and for letting people do totally
1007.25,3.06,whatever they want obviously we would
1008.93,3.51,have loved it if decentralized
1010.31,2.7,optimization resulted in a fully optimal
1012.44,2.339,solution
1013.01,4.079,we're not that surprised to see that
1014.779,3.721,it's you know less than optimal but
1017.089,3.271,maybe we're not that discouraged that
1018.5,3.72,it's pretty close for thirds in these
1020.36,3.539,networks so if you have you're a
1022.22,3.9,graduate student looking for something
1023.899,4.41,to do looking for something to prove you
1026.12,4.079,could imagine you know a good rule of
1028.309,3.301,thumb is always to be optimistic so like
1030.199,3.36,I tell my students always you know
1031.61,4.709,what's the coolest thing that could be
1033.559,4.411,true but you haven't it falsified so we
1036.319,3.901,okay we have two examples price of
1037.97,3.959,entropy is 4/3 and both maybe it's never
1040.22,3.15,bigger than 4/3 that's sort of the
1041.929,3.931,coolest thing that I can figure that
1043.37,4.62,could be true at this point so that's
1045.86,4.62,pretty easy to show that that's a little
1047.99,4.53,bit too good to be true if we just
1050.48,4.29,modify Piggy's example in a very small
1052.52,4.44,way so we used to have an X on the
1054.77,4.65,toplink let's make that X to the D okay
1056.96,4.17,where D is big d is you know 10 20
1059.42,4.41,whatever okay some highly nonlinear
1061.13,5.43,function on top so how does this change
1063.83,4.29,Pickers example well The Selfish outcome
1066.56,3.57,is no different than before for exactly
1068.12,3.99,the same reasoning the worst case here
1070.13,4.35,remains one the best case here remains
1072.11,3.63,one so again in the equilibrium we
1074.48,3.12,expect the top length to be fully
1075.74,4.5,congested and everybody's cost to be one
1077.6,4.56,what's different is that now with
1080.24,4.56,dictatorial control of the network we
1082.16,4.98,can do far far better how do we do that
1084.8,4.62,we remove an epsilon fraction of the
1087.14,3.87,traffic off of the top and reroute them
1089.42,4.86,on the bottom okay where epsilon is
1091.01,5.13,small D is big epsilon is small so what
1094.28,3.75,happens well if you think about it
1096.14,4.62,almost all the traffic gets from s to T
1098.03,4.77,almost instantaneously one minus epsilon
1100.76,4.74,to the D D powers that down to basically
1102.8,4.32,zero if d is sufficiently big so almost
1105.5,3.63,everybody gets there instantaneously a
1107.12,3.21,few martyrs are stuck taking an hour but
1109.13,3.6,they contribute very little to the
1110.33,4.77,average so as d grows large and epsilon
1112.73,4.47,goes small the best possible solution is
1115.1,4.38,going to zero so the price of Anarchy
1117.2,4.98,which is the ratio is going to infinity
1119.48,4.35,so there's no universal upper bound on
1122.18,5.15,what this price of Anarchy can be even
1123.83,6.6,in these simplest of routing networks
1127.33,4.69,okay but so you can't get this you can't
1130.43,3.75,get to gets discouraged in research you
1132.02,4.05,just have to sort of take a step back so
1134.18,3.63,now what do we know is true we know that
1136.07,3.18,the price of Anarchy is small in these
1137.81,3.18,networks and we know that it's big in
1139.25,3.75,this one okay and in general it can be
1140.99,4.41,arbitrarily big so could it be that
1143.0,4.64,there are relatively weak conditions on
1145.4,4.59,a network you could impose that
1147.64,3.88,guarantee under those conditions the
1149.99,3.69,price of Anarchy is close to one that
1151.52,3.75,the outcome of selfish behavior is not
1153.68,4.47,significantly worse than what could be
1155.27,4.35,attained with perfect regulation so you
1158.15,3.15,know looking at these three networks
1159.62,4.29,again if you were feeling kind of very
1161.3,4.8,glib you might say well this one's bad
1163.91,3.33,it has a nonlinear function here are two
1166.1,2.97,different networks that don't have
1167.24,3.42,nonlinear functions they're good so
1169.07,3.36,maybe all you need is to just say
1170.66,3.66,there's no highly nonlinear functions
1172.43,2.97,that's sort of the coolest thing I can
1174.32,4.65,think of right now that would be true
1175.4,4.68,okay and that actually is true turns out
1178.97,3.96,so this is a theorem you can actually
1180.08,3.9,prove so consider any network I should
1182.93,2.58,say the reason there's something to
1183.98,2.8,prove is because networks can get really
1185.51,2.68,big and complicated
1186.78,3.39,they're not just two nodes in four nodes
1188.19,3.84,but no matter how complicated a gay they
1190.17,4.53,get as long as the cost functions have
1192.03,3.93,this affine form ax plus B a and B can
1194.7,4.2,be whatever you want for different links
1195.96,4.86,then you'll never see a worse example
1198.9,4.11,than the two I just showed you so in
1200.82,4.55,particular pig is - no - link example
1203.01,5.04,already realizes the maximum possible
1205.37,4.63,efficiency loss amongst so these
1208.05,3.84,so-called selfish routing networks with
1210.0,4.14,a find cost functions and so again this
1211.89,4.23,network can be arbitrarily large any
1214.14,3.18,number of origins and destinations it
1216.12,2.73,doesn't matter you let people do
1217.32,3.87,whatever they want and it just won't
1218.85,5.75,ever drift that much worse than what you
1221.19,5.88,could do with full centralized control
1224.6,4.66,so I wasn't planning on proving this
1227.07,5.1,theorem but maybe just you know you let
1229.26,4.41,me give you sort of a morally why maybe
1232.17,3.33,something like this should be true just
1233.67,4.86,sort of a you know rough proof by
1235.5,4.17,analogy so instead of routing traffic
1238.53,3.18,through networks let's think about
1239.67,4.98,electrical current in an electrical
1241.71,4.41,network okay between two terminals so
1244.65,3.3,what do we know about electrical current
1246.12,3.15,well so we know that on the one hand
1247.95,3.24,they can be it can be thought of as an
1249.27,3.78,equilibrium it equalizes the voltage
1251.19,3.87,drop across any two paths between the
1253.05,3.63,two terminals on the other hand we also
1255.06,2.97,know that we can think of electrical
1256.68,3.39,current is optimizing something
1258.03,4.32,thompson's principle tells us that it
1260.07,3.57,minimizes the dissipated energy so
1262.35,3.3,that's really nice electro currents
1263.64,5.04,simultaneously in equilibrium and it's
1265.65,4.83,an optimizer turns out electrical
1268.68,4.05,current and electrical networks is just
1270.48,4.59,a special case of traffic equilibria in
1272.73,4.05,these traffic networks it corresponds to
1275.07,4.08,networks where every link has a cost
1276.78,4.92,function of the form ax okay some of the
1279.15,4.14,x over here - X over there 4x over there
1281.7,3.39,corresponding the resistances an
1283.29,3.39,electrical current is just going to be
1285.09,3.78,correspond to the corresponding traffic
1286.68,3.78,equilibrium so the two things we know
1288.87,4.17,about electrical current actually says
1290.46,5.58,that the price of Anarchy equals 1 if
1293.04,4.59,all the cost functions have the form ax
1296.04,3.75,that's what Thompson's principle tells
1297.63,4.2,us so we've generalized the model a
1299.79,3.6,little bit we now have a find cost
1301.83,4.62,functions not just these pure linear
1303.39,4.53,ones but you might hope that you know we
1306.45,2.49,know that it's not fully efficient but
1307.92,1.92,you might hope that it doesn't break
1308.94,3.93,down too badly
1309.84,5.34,and indeed traffic equilibria in these
1312.87,3.96,networks do still minimize some kind of
1315.18,2.13,energy function some kind of potential
1316.83,2.52,function
1317.31,2.55,it just happens to not be exactly the
1319.35,2.28,right one
1319.86,4.77,we care about the average traveled
1321.63,5.16,travel time of the traffic the good news
1324.63,3.929,is for these a fine cost functions those
1326.79,4.41,two potential functions don't differ by
1328.559,4.081,very much so because equilibria exactly
1331.2,2.46,optimize something that's an almost
1332.64,3.18,correct function
1333.66,4.019,they almost optimize the function which
1335.82,4.08,we really care about the average delay
1337.679,4.261,so that's sort of a proof by metaphor
1339.9,3.42,about why some kind of guarantee for
1341.94,3.9,equilibria should be true for these
1343.32,4.83,selfish routing networks so just to
1345.84,3.33,close the loop I said the computer
1348.15,4.019,scientists were coming from a
1349.17,4.53,communication network standpoint and to
1352.169,2.971,reason about communication networks you
1353.7,3.27,really want to go beyond a find cost
1355.14,3.45,functions and we know that this theorem
1356.97,4.14,as stated is false for a fund cost
1358.59,4.29,functions it's no longer 4/3 but there
1361.11,3.78,is one aspect of the theorem that
1362.88,4.049,remains true for any types of cost
1364.89,4.08,functions which is the structure of the
1366.929,4.051,worst case example so one way to
1368.97,3.87,interpret this theorem is look I showed
1370.98,4.439,you Pickers example I showed you the
1372.84,4.74,price of Anarchy can be as big as 4 over
1375.419,3.661,3 this theorem says it can't be any
1377.58,3.9,bigger than what you already see in this
1379.08,4.589,trivial to no Tunick Network and that
1381.48,4.11,statement is actually true whatever the
1383.669,4.201,cost functions no matter what the cost
1385.59,3.719,functions you care about go hunting far
1387.87,3.42,and wide for the worst network you're
1389.309,3.631,ever going to find the worst network is
1391.29,3.6,always one of these simple pig-like
1392.94,3.39,networks to node to link networks ok so
1394.89,4.47,that's true even if they're not a fine
1396.33,5.19,cost functions now knowing that you can
1399.36,4.5,actually compute this price of Anarchy
1401.52,4.529,this magic number for any class of cost
1403.86,3.24,functions that you care about it reduces
1406.049,4.201,it just to a back-of-the-envelope
1407.1,4.8,calculation so you know if you open up
1410.25,4.679,page 1 of a typical data networks
1411.9,4.47,textbook the first order bit of a cost
1414.929,4.291,function you usually use something like
1416.37,4.29,a delay function of them mm1 queue so
1419.22,3.06,here's you think of you as being some
1420.66,3.63,capacity the maximum amount of traffic
1422.28,4.17,that a link can support and this is a
1424.29,4.29,cost function which looks like this so
1426.45,3.719,there's an asymptote at the capacity the
1428.58,3.42,delay is very low when you're far from
1430.169,3.151,the capacity and it shoots up very
1432.0,4.559,suddenly once you get close to the
1433.32,5.28,capacity now people who actually manage
1436.559,3.811,telecommunication networks one of the
1438.6,3.99,standard heuristics they use to keep
1440.37,3.96,performance sensible as they look at
1442.59,3.69,link utilization and park is this is a
1444.33,3.75,pretty easy thing to measure so you have
1446.28,2.97,some cable you have some maximum amount
1448.08,3.12,of traffic that can be going through at
1449.25,3.66,any one time and you basically you know
1451.2,2.5,stick your finger in it and you see how
1452.91,3.7,much is going across
1453.7,4.89,right now and networks are often managed
1456.61,3.63,to keep link utilizations bounded away
1458.59,3.12,from a hundred percent because that's a
1460.24,2.76,good heuristic or it's been empirically
1461.71,3.87,observed that that works well for
1463.0,4.169,keeping network performance good so the
1465.58,3.24,theory I just described can turn that
1467.169,4.11,into it into a theorem into a rigorous
1468.82,4.17,statement so to quantify link
1471.279,4.411,utilization let me use this parameter
1472.99,5.46,beta so this is the fraction of a link
1475.69,4.56,that's unused so beta equal point one
1478.45,3.78,would mean that all the links of your
1480.25,5.34,network have link utilization at most
1482.23,5.189,ninety percent okay so using the theory
1485.59,3.6,I just mentioned you can compute exactly
1487.419,3.99,what the worst-case price of Anarchy is
1489.19,3.51,as a function of this beta as this
1491.409,3.9,function of your maximum link
1492.7,3.599,utilization and you know you know we're
1495.309,2.311,all supposed to be in kind of
1496.299,3.24,quantitative sciences here and I've got
1497.62,4.98,you for an hour so I feel like I owe you
1499.539,5.431,at least one kind of obscure formula so
1502.6,4.169,here's your obscure formula but this is
1504.97,3.51,exact this is really the right answer so
1506.769,3.721,if all I tell you about a network is
1508.48,3.27,that the link utilization is at most 1
1510.49,2.88,minus beta so if it's beta
1511.75,3.09,over-provision and I tell you nothing
1513.37,3.57,else otherwise the network can be
1514.84,4.65,arbitrarily large and complicated then
1516.94,4.92,in fact the worst-case ratio between
1519.49,6.299,selfish and optimal behavior is exactly
1521.86,6.27,this so what is this okay well let's let
1525.789,3.75,one go to zero so beta go to zero so
1528.13,3.659,that says the link utilization is going
1529.539,4.921,to 100% this thing is shooting off to
1531.789,4.89,infinity as beta goes to zero but that
1534.46,4.559,shouldn't surprise us because right at
1536.679,3.901,the asymptotes we see that these cost
1539.019,3.27,functions look a lot like super high
1540.58,3.12,degree polynomials and we already knew
1542.289,3.12,that you could have undoubted efficiency
1543.7,4.109,loss for super high degree polynomials
1545.409,3.961,on the other extreme as beta goes to 1
1547.809,3.391,that means your networks basically empty
1549.37,2.85,so there's basically no problem with
1551.2,3.27,selfish routing you get a price of
1552.22,4.14,anarchy of 1 the reason it's nice having
1554.47,3.63,such a crisp formula is you can plug in
1556.36,4.59,quite modest values of beta and see what
1558.1,4.199,you get so if you plug in point 1 so
1560.95,3.3,again this is just keeping the link
1562.299,3.931,utilization down to 90% there's still
1564.25,3.899,mostly used it's 90% or less
1566.23,3.6,already this ratio drops to something
1568.149,3.601,close to 2 and again this is a
1569.83,3.42,worst-case guarantee over all networks
1571.75,7.799,subject to this link utilization
1573.25,8.73,guarantee so what did we learn by
1579.549,4.08,applying the lens of theta or it's
1581.98,2.73,basically the toolbox of theoretical
1583.629,3.011,computer science to these routing
1584.71,4.0,networks so the MA
1586.64,3.6,it's an age-old economic model okay so
1588.71,3.84,piggy was discussing it almost a hundred
1590.24,5.55,years ago in his book it was made
1592.55,5.4,rigorous by war drop and beckon McGuire
1595.79,3.84,and Winston in the 50s and there's been
1597.95,4.02,literally hundreds if not thousands of
1599.63,5.43,papers written on this model largely in
1601.97,4.08,transportation but before computer
1605.06,2.67,scientists started seeing about this
1606.05,4.02,problem no one was thinking about
1607.73,4.44,approximation indeed the first
1610.07,4.11,experience I can remember describing
1612.17,3.99,this result to an economist was here at
1614.18,4.05,the Institute I was visiting in 2002
1616.16,4.5,professor Victor Shin was kind enough to
1618.23,3.93,introduce me to Eric Maskin who since
1620.66,4.2,then is one of Nobel Prize in Economics
1622.16,5.01,and Eric very patiently listened to my
1624.86,4.59,description and he said it's a very
1627.17,3.09,natural result I never would have
1629.45,2.76,thought to prove it
1630.26,3.81,and I've heard that over and over again
1632.21,4.23,from economists as I told them about
1634.07,3.81,this work and so you know I have I've
1636.44,2.49,sort of wondered you know why is that
1637.88,3.09,not true especially when I was a
1638.93,3.63,graduate student and I was terrified of
1640.97,4.2,you know finding the main result of my
1642.56,5.55,thesis you know in some 1972 obscure
1645.17,4.47,econ Journal so I had to tell myself a
1648.11,3.27,story I needed a narrative why
1649.64,3.0,conceivably this might be a novel result
1651.38,3.15,and of course I still might be proved
1652.64,3.84,wrong in the future but the best i've
1654.53,4.29,come up with is that you know really
1656.48,4.26,even though this application had nothing
1658.82,3.21,to do with computation okay i wasn't
1660.74,4.11,didn't want an algorithm
1662.03,4.62,nothing was np-complete still you know
1664.85,4.35,as a theoretical peter scientist I've
1666.65,4.71,lived my whole life in the long shadow
1669.2,3.87,cast by NP completeness and I've
1671.36,3.66,absorbed the toolbox that we've all
1673.07,3.93,developed for compromising when you
1675.02,3.69,can't get what you want and so when
1677.0,3.72,you're just analyzing equilibria in
1678.71,3.39,games in the wild they're not going to
1680.72,3.36,be fully efficient which is what you
1682.1,3.66,would really want but turning to
1684.08,3.99,approximation we can nevertheless
1685.76,4.02,salvage I think some very positive and
1688.07,4.41,kind of really new insights into
1689.78,5.16,economic models that are almost 100
1692.48,4.29,years old I think that's what the seus
1694.94,6.54,lens gets you in this particular case
1696.77,6.3,for the second application I want to
1701.48,4.23,talk about something actually quite
1703.07,4.26,practical so this will be probably maybe
1705.71,3.75,one of the more you know immediately
1707.33,3.54,real-world things that we you know
1709.46,4.59,really engineering projects that we talk
1710.87,5.49,about today and so what I want to
1714.05,4.02,highlight here is how a novel and
1716.36,3.179,large-scale auction which is being
1718.07,3.15,designed as we speak
1719.539,3.63,I want to point out all of the different
1721.22,4.23,ways in which the high-level aspects of
1723.169,6.421,that design have been influenced by work
1725.45,9.0,in computer science so the story here
1729.59,6.299,starts in 2012 when Congress cost a bill
1734.45,4.62,passed the bill which is sometimes
1735.889,5.37,called this spectrum Act okay and the
1739.07,6.809,point of this bill was to authorize the
1741.259,6.51,FCC to run design and execute a novel
1745.879,4.28,type of auction and the goal of the
1747.769,5.551,option is to sell wireless spectrum
1750.159,5.98,probably mostly to telecoms for wireless
1753.32,5.279,broadband use now that by itself is not
1756.139,4.02,novel so whether whether you may or may
1758.599,4.111,not have been aware of this but the FCC
1760.159,5.34,for over 20 years has been running these
1762.71,5.219,so-called combinatorial auctions to sell
1765.499,3.93,wireless spectrum to in effect the
1767.929,3.87,highest bidder whoever could make the
1769.429,4.32,best use of that technology here's
1771.799,3.0,what's different this time around what's
1773.749,3.721,different this time around is the
1774.799,5.161,spectrum which is most valuable for
1777.47,5.039,wireless broadband is pretty much all
1779.96,4.23,already accounted for okay the
1782.509,4.26,government just doesn't really have any
1784.19,5.429,free spectrum lying around to give away
1786.769,5.01,and so on the other hand a lot of the
1789.619,4.351,people who own that spectrum are
1791.779,4.32,arguably not using it in particularly
1793.97,4.139,interesting or valuable ways in fact a
1796.099,4.231,ton of it is owned by just television
1798.109,4.231,broadcasters who frankly if they went
1800.33,5.809,poof overnight not many people would
1802.34,6.899,notice so we're talking about
1806.139,8.71,broadcasters on the UHF channels 38 to
1809.239,7.231,51 okay and regional broadcasters so the
1814.849,5.13,proposal here which is very interesting
1816.47,5.429,is to repurpose that spectrum for more
1819.979,4.741,valuable use so this is actually going
1821.899,4.76,to be a double auction which means that
1824.72,5.49,the FCC is responsible for
1826.659,5.86,simultaneously buying back licenses from
1830.21,5.13,television broadcasters and turning
1832.519,6.21,around and selling it to wireless
1835.34,4.949,telecoms okay for broadband use so what
1838.729,3.42,they've been running for 20 years are
1840.289,3.72,so-called forward options so a forward
1842.149,4.59,auction is like when you're selling your
1844.009,3.931,house okay you accept bids and then you
1846.739,2.16,figure out who the winner is and what
1847.94,3.75,they're going to pay like the highest
1848.899,4.351,bidder a reverse auction is like when
1851.69,3.9,you're hiring a contractor
1853.25,3.6,can you accept bids and then you you
1855.59,2.7,know you pick one of them okay they're
1856.85,2.97,gonna provide a service to you like you
1858.29,4.02,picked the lowest bit of any of the
1859.82,4.14,contractors so the FCC is has a lot of
1862.31,3.06,experience with forward auctions selling
1863.96,3.36,wireless spectrum this will be the first
1865.37,3.75,time ever that they've run a reverse
1867.32,4.83,auction they've actually bought by
1869.12,4.65,spectrum back okay the numbers the
1872.15,3.75,estimated numbers are fairly eye-popping
1873.77,4.8,so the the most recent Congressional
1875.9,4.02,Budget Office estimates that I saw was
1878.57,4.53,that they would be spending fifteen
1879.92,5.01,billion dollars buying these licenses
1883.1,4.08,back from the broadcaster's and are
1884.93,6.24,hoping to make 40 billion selling them
1887.18,6.66,to telecoms probably some of you are
1891.17,6.99,wondering about you know it's pretty big
1893.84,5.91,spread and as part of the bill passing
1898.16,3.66,that's already been earmarked really
1899.75,4.44,won't be surprised to hear so after
1901.82,3.9,covering auction costs and funding a new
1904.19,3.3,first responder Network which is really
1905.72,3.3,totally cheap the bill claims to be
1907.49,4.47,hoping to have twenty billion of that go
1909.02,5.1,into budget deficit reduction okay and
1911.96,3.99,so I said one name was the spectrum axe
1914.12,3.72,the other name of the real name of the
1915.95,6.15,bill is the middle-class tax relief and
1917.84,6.15,Job Creation Act because I mean are you
1922.1,8.31,really gonna vote against a bill called
1923.99,9.81,the middle-class tax room okay so the
1930.41,5.4,numbers are big and to thicken the plot
1933.8,4.86,further if you design these actions
1935.81,4.98,auctions badly terrible things can
1938.66,4.44,happen ok debacles really have occurred
1940.79,4.95,so one famous one was in New Zealand
1943.1,4.74,this is quite a while ago 1990 and they
1945.74,4.08,were just selling licenses to broadcast
1947.84,4.92,on TV again it was a very simple setup
1949.82,5.01,they had 10 licenses to broadcast and
1952.76,3.6,they were basically interchangeable okay
1954.83,5.1,so you just needed to sell all ten of
1956.36,6.63,them and for reasons that I still do not
1959.93,6.78,understand they decided on the option
1962.99,6.12,format of simultaneous sealed bid second
1966.71,4.56,price auctions so a second price or
1969.11,3.99,Vickrey auction in some cases is a
1971.27,2.97,really good idea okay here it wasn't a
1973.1,3.3,really good idea but so here's what a
1974.24,4.62,second price sealed bid auction is it's
1976.4,4.2,almost equivalent to eBay so you write
1978.86,3.24,down a bit in an envelope you pass all
1980.6,3.9,of those to the seller the seller opens
1982.1,4.2,them up the winner is the obvious one
1984.5,3.51,the highest bidder
1986.3,3.54,the price may not be the first one you
1988.01,3.39,think about the price is actually the
1989.84,3.48,second highest bid okay so the highest
1991.4,3.63,bid by one of your competitors all right
1993.32,4.8,but if you think about it like you know
1995.03,4.59,in a art auction or on eBay the winner
1998.12,3.57,doesn't really pay their bid generally
1999.62,3.63,they pay the lowest bid necessary to
2001.69,3.15,beat out everybody else which is
2003.25,3.81,basically the second highest bid overall
2004.84,5.55,okay so this is a very sensible auction
2007.06,5.01,in some contests however now I imagine
2010.39,3.69,that those tennety is going on at once
2012.07,3.66,and you're somebody who just you just
2014.08,3.39,want a license okay you don't care which
2015.73,3.21,of the ten you get okay you have no use
2017.47,3.78,for two okay
2018.94,4.35,use one one and they're saying oh yeah
2021.25,4.77,submit anywhere up to ten bids in these
2023.29,8.37,ten sealed bid auctions so what should
2026.02,8.13,you do well you could like pick your
2031.66,5.49,favorite number like seven and go all in
2034.15,4.62,for license number seven you could say
2037.15,3.0,well you know maybe not that many people
2038.77,2.61,are bidding for these right maybe
2040.15,3.24,there's only like fifteen or twenty
2041.38,4.32,people actually bidding and then maybe I
2043.39,4.5,should bid super low on a bunch of them
2045.7,3.84,hoping I get one at a bargain it's
2047.89,3.51,another totally legitimate strategy and
2049.54,3.48,one rule of thumb is is if you have an
2051.4,3.54,auction where it's not clear how to play
2053.02,4.74,there's definitely vulnerable to bad
2054.94,4.41,results in particular the New Zealand
2057.76,4.62,government was really hoping to make a
2059.35,6.09,quarter billion dollars in this auction
2062.38,9.51,that was the projection they wanted
2065.44,9.15,making 36 million and to add insult to
2071.89,4.35,injury I guess for reasons of
2074.59,6.3,transparency they were required to
2076.24,6.33,actually publish the winning bids in the
2080.89,3.32,prices at which things were sold and
2082.57,4.68,remember this is a second-price auction
2084.21,4.39,okay so the winner pays not what they
2087.25,4.8,said they would be willing to pay but
2088.6,5.579,rather the next highest bid one of these
2092.05,5.73,licenses the high bid was for a half a
2094.179,7.981,million so 500 thousand the second
2097.78,8.37,highest bid was for six not six thousand
2102.16,7.16,but six okay so someone got a broadcast
2106.15,3.17,license for six bucks
2111.95,4.869,now right and then if you scale that up
2115.26,2.609,to sort of modern-day in the US we're
2116.819,3.75,also talking about two orders of
2117.869,4.95,magnitude more money okay so the lesson
2120.569,4.53,being it's that is people know they need
2122.819,5.01,to think very very carefully about these
2125.099,4.801,auction designs so let me tell you so
2127.829,4.111,this is double auction it's currently
2129.9,4.26,slated to be run in early 2016
2131.94,3.629,though all of the details have not been
2134.16,4.29,announced okay so some of this is
2135.569,4.591,speculation based on my conversations
2138.45,4.32,with people and meetings I've been to
2140.16,4.889,but let me tell you what seems has all
2142.77,4.43,has you know coagulated as the high
2145.049,4.26,order bits of the of the auction format
2147.2,3.55,and so I'm only gonna I'm gonna
2149.309,2.901,focus mostly on the reverse auction cuz
2150.75,3.63,that's just the part where you're buying
2152.21,3.73,licenses from TV broadcasters because
2154.38,4.32,that's the part which really has to be
2155.94,5.25,invented from scratch so it looks like
2158.7,4.5,they're gonna go with a proposal by two
2161.19,4.23,economist colleagues of mine at Stanford
2163.2,3.93,Paul Milgram in Elia Segal Illya Segal
2165.42,3.51,incidentally I also met for the first
2167.13,4.919,time at the Institute that same visit in
2168.93,5.85,2002 and so what they proposed is a
2172.049,4.05,descending clock auction okay and I'll
2174.78,3.059,give you some more details later but
2176.099,4.95,first let me just kind of tell you at a
2177.839,5.701,high level how this works so there's a
2181.049,3.721,bunch of broadcasters participating in
2183.54,2.61,this auction and remember what we're
2184.77,3.27,trying to figure out we're trying to
2186.15,4.56,figure out which broadcasters we're
2188.04,6.36,going to buy out and if we buy them outs
2190.71,5.909,at what prices okay so you're probably
2194.4,3.84,used to ascending auctions okay but here
2196.619,4.351,because we're buying out people rather
2198.24,3.93,than buying goods we start high and we
2200.97,4.079,go low all right
2202.17,4.62,so initially so at every every round
2205.049,4.441,every broadcaster has offered some
2206.79,4.44,buyout price which they can accept in
2209.49,3.089,which case I can say yep I'm gonna take
2211.23,5.069,the money and run you can have the
2212.579,6.27,license or they can decline all right
2216.299,4.651,now in any given round if a buyer
2218.849,3.51,accepts the price that just means they
2220.95,2.58,proceed to the next round that doesn't
2222.359,3.271,necessarily mean they're gonna be bought
2223.53,4.049,out at that price we may ask them again
2225.63,4.77,next round if they're still willing to
2227.579,5.191,be bought out at a lower price however
2230.4,4.89,if a broadcaster ever refuses and says
2232.77,4.529,no I'm not willing to pay 400 I'm not
2235.29,4.11,willing to be paid 400 million dollars
2237.299,4.05,for my license then they're kicked out
2239.4,2.85,of the auction forever okay and they get
2241.349,3.331,to keep their license
2242.25,4.71,and they got no compensation okay so the
2244.68,4.38,the bidder is still in the auction are
2246.96,5.28,those who still might get bought out by
2249.06,5.13,the FCC so what you do is you initially
2252.24,2.55,start with a huge buyout price for
2254.19,1.8,everybody
2254.79,3.24,probably we're talking something like a
2255.99,3.42,half a billion dollars so that everybody
2258.03,3.81,in the auction contractually is
2259.41,5.13,obligated to accept that initial opening
2261.84,5.25,buyout price but then you know the FCC
2264.54,4.26,says well you know for the amount of
2267.09,3.36,spectrum we actually want to sell that's
2268.8,3.42,overkill we don't need to buy everybody
2270.45,3.51,out so in the next round we're gonna
2272.22,3.27,lower some of these buy out prices we're
2273.96,3.03,gonna try to get we're gonna try to buy
2275.49,4.17,a bunch of licenses at a at a smaller
2276.99,4.29,cost and then that just continues so the
2279.66,3.33,auction keeps lowering prices and
2281.28,3.99,eventually some of these broadcasters
2282.99,5.07,refuse and say no I'm not willing to be
2285.27,4.26,bought out at that lower price so what I
2288.06,3.75,need to tell you more about is when the
2289.53,4.29,option stops okay so again you start
2291.81,4.53,high and you decrease the prices of
2293.82,4.35,everybody as the auction proceeds so
2296.34,4.14,intuitively what this auction is
2298.17,4.23,aspiring to do is it's expiring it's
2300.48,4.61,aspiring to buy a target amount of
2302.4,5.13,wireless spectrum as cheaply as possible
2305.09,3.79,so what would be an example of a target
2307.53,2.73,amount of spectrum so think of it in
2308.88,3.18,terms of TV channels and this this
2310.26,3.54,really is how they think about it so
2312.06,4.83,we're talking about people broadcasting
2313.8,5.19,between channels 38 and 51 that's 14
2316.89,4.14,channels let's say we'd like to free up
2318.99,3.869,ten of them okay so we're gonna retain
2321.03,3.03,four channels worth of TV stations but
2322.859,4.141,10 of those channels will be freed up
2324.06,4.98,for wireless broadband okay now there's
2327.0,3.9,a really interesting issue which is that
2329.04,3.63,these television stations are scattered
2330.9,5.07,across 14 channels and they're not just
2332.67,5.13,going to conveniently fall out of a
2335.97,5.43,particular 10 piece of channels ok these
2337.8,6.289,buyouts will happen across all 14 so a
2341.4,5.55,crucial part of this auction design is
2344.089,4.841,that after you buy out some of the TV
2346.95,4.35,stations you look at who's left
2348.93,4.11,who's retaining their license and then
2351.3,3.39,you're actually going to repack them
2353.04,3.63,you're gonna give television stations
2354.69,4.02,who still have their license a new
2356.67,4.62,channel ok so your favorite TV station
2358.71,4.11,might go from channel 37 to channel 40
2361.29,4.049,that's totally possible in this option
2362.82,5.16,so you take who's left and you repack
2365.339,3.481,them in a small amount of channels let
2367.98,4.29,me show you how this works with a
2368.82,5.7,picture so suppose initially things look
2372.27,4.36,like this okay so here each circle
2374.52,5.23,represents a broadcaster
2376.63,5.64,the circle indicates the radius on which
2379.75,4.53,they broadcast and the color indicates a
2382.27,3.93,channel ok so there's three channels in
2384.28,3.54,this picture you'll notice whenever two
2386.2,3.24,circles overlap they have different
2387.82,2.34,colors that's what they don't interfere
2389.44,3.06,with each other
2390.16,4.23,okay that's a constraint and anything
2392.5,3.69,about it if you have all of these TV
2394.39,3.66,stations there's no way to use fewer
2396.19,3.18,than three channels because there's
2398.05,3.84,three different stations here who
2399.37,4.8,mutually overlap okay so three three
2401.89,3.54,channels are really necessary to have
2404.17,4.32,all these broadcasters without
2405.43,5.52,interference on the other hand you could
2408.49,4.98,buy out one of the TV broadcasters they
2410.95,4.02,disappear and at the moment that didn't
2413.47,4.32,help because we're still using three
2414.97,6.0,channels but now if we do a channel
2417.79,5.16,reassignment we can have them all not
2420.97,4.5,interfere with each other using only two
2422.95,4.08,channels okay so we just bought someone
2425.47,4.65,out and we've freed up one channels
2427.03,4.65,worth of spectrum after a repacking okay
2430.12,3.06,so that's how this auctions going to
2431.68,3.84,work it's going to buy out a ton of
2433.18,4.08,people free up a bunch of space and
2435.52,3.21,repack the people who are left into a
2437.26,3.18,small number of channels and then the
2438.73,5.31,freedom channels will be sold for
2440.44,5.19,wireless spectrum okay so that's the
2444.04,4.02,gist of the auction let me tell you a
2445.63,4.17,little bit about how work in computer
2448.06,4.92,science has influenced this design and
2449.8,4.77,implementation so first of all the high
2452.98,3.87,level design these descending clock
2454.57,4.11,auctions these are actually a direct
2456.85,3.87,extension of some previous work by
2458.68,4.29,computer scientists specifically my
2460.72,4.29,first ever PhD student Mukunda Rajan
2462.97,5.37,also with ronique Mehta who at that
2465.01,4.77,point was at IBM and so the really nice
2468.34,3.09,property of these auctions is they have
2469.78,3.42,strong incentive properties so if you're
2471.43,3.45,one of the bidders in these auctions you
2473.2,5.04,have very strong incentives to behave
2474.88,6.12,honestly okay meaning to drop out of the
2478.24,4.59,auction exactly when the price reaches
2481.0,3.18,your value for that license okay so
2482.83,3.05,you're not gonna drop out early and
2484.18,4.44,you're not going to stay in too long
2485.88,4.51,ironically again even though these these
2488.62,3.45,types of mechanisms so these strong
2490.39,3.12,incentive constraints are inherited by
2492.07,3.48,the more general proposal of Milgram and
2493.51,3.96,Segal but the reason we propose these
2495.55,3.18,mechanisms again it's because we
2497.47,3.09,actually wanted computationally
2498.73,3.48,efficient mechanisms we were aware of
2500.56,3.27,these incentives all of their incentive
2502.21,3.57,properties but we wanted also
2503.83,3.72,computational efficiency because of the
2505.78,4.2,NP completeness intractability barrier
2507.55,3.27,and we wanted to harness the big toolbox
2509.98,1.92,of approximate
2510.82,3.21,algorithms that have come out of
2511.9,4.65,theoretical computer science turns out
2514.03,3.99,the definition we came up with is more
2516.55,4.83,broadly useful for this double auction
2518.02,5.28,design second connection and this
2521.38,5.31,involves a colleague of mine at Stanford
2523.3,5.04,CSU I've shown so I mentioned that's in
2526.69,3.69,each round of the auction you can
2528.34,4.47,decrease the buyout price of various
2530.38,4.23,broadcasters and know where the
2532.81,3.51,flexibility of the auction is that you
2534.61,3.48,can decrease different broadcasters by
2536.32,3.45,different amounts so some you can
2538.09,4.23,decrease really aggressively and others
2539.77,3.81,you can leave very high now why might
2542.32,3.33,you want to treat two different people
2543.58,5.97,asymmetrically well remember at the end
2545.65,6.63,of the day whoever you don't buy out has
2549.55,4.26,to get repacked okay and because some
2552.28,4.14,television stations interfere with
2553.81,5.1,others much more than some you're really
2556.42,5.49,scared about having a very difficult to
2558.91,4.44,repack television station dropout okay
2561.91,3.69,that makes your repacking problem really
2563.35,3.9,hard so if someone's really hard to
2565.6,3.84,repack he might be much less aggressive
2567.25,3.72,about decreasing their buyout price
2569.44,3.57,whereas if someone doesn't interfere
2570.97,3.21,with anybody then you can decrease their
2573.01,2.85,price as far as you want you don't
2574.18,2.82,really care if they drop out and you're
2575.86,4.17,not gonna be able to buy their license
2577.0,4.83,from them okay so there's a question of
2580.03,3.51,how do you do that how do you choose how
2581.83,3.09,aggressively to decrease these buyout
2583.54,3.69,prices for different television for
2584.92,4.2,broadcasting stations and again the
2587.23,3.48,details have not been announced but what
2589.12,3.69,has been being proposed and the
2590.71,5.43,preliminary plans are very directly
2592.81,5.58,inspired by you know really aspects of
2596.14,4.5,approximation so heuristic algorithms
2598.39,3.48,for np-hard problems which you off show
2600.64,3.3,them was dealing with in a forward
2601.87,3.99,auction context so exactly the same
2603.94,3.84,issues of trading off you know how much
2605.86,5.01,money versus how many conflicts does a
2607.78,4.47,does a bidder creates that's exactly the
2610.87,3.0,what these heuristics are meant to
2612.25,3.63,address and again the motivation here
2613.87,6.24,was because of the NP completeness of a
2615.88,6.75,certain optimization problem alright so
2620.11,4.38,are the computer science toolbox has
2622.63,3.68,more than just approximation as far as
2624.49,4.29,ways of coping with NP completeness
2626.31,4.45,sometimes you really want to solve a
2628.78,4.11,problem exactly and you're really
2630.76,4.74,willing to devote tremendous human
2632.89,4.86,monetary and computational resources for
2635.5,4.26,doing it and we have an example of such
2637.75,4.8,an np-complete problem in this very
2639.76,4.5,auction format I showed you the
2642.55,2.91,repacking problem okay
2644.26,3.66,with all of these colored circles
2645.46,4.89,overlapping with each other that's an
2647.92,4.02,instantiation of a totally canonical and
2650.35,3.93,p-complete problem known as graph
2651.94,4.17,coloring and it's a difficult and B
2654.28,3.57,complete problem there's really no easy
2656.11,5.19,way to solve it efficiently on all
2657.85,5.22,instances so other parts of the toolbox
2661.3,3.24,are being opened to tackle this part of
2663.07,2.82,the auction design and this is led by
2664.54,3.93,Kevin Leighton Brown as computer
2665.89,5.33,scientist at UBC and an expert in this
2668.47,5.22,kind of stuff and so he showed how these
2671.22,4.06,repacking problems can be formulated
2673.69,5.31,very nicely as instances of
2675.28,5.46,satisfiability or SATs he showed how you
2679.0,3.42,know this a huge amount of satsang
2680.74,3.36,technology in computer science the
2682.42,3.6,off-the-shelf ones still aren't quite
2684.1,3.57,good enough to get the performance they
2686.02,3.87,need in practice so they really want to
2687.67,3.6,solve sad instances with like tens of
2689.89,3.12,thousands of variables hundreds of
2691.27,3.87,thousands of constraints and maybe a
2693.01,3.57,second or something like that so
2695.14,3.48,off-the-shelf techniques aren't quite
2696.58,4.05,good enough but if you encode additional
2698.62,3.84,domain knowledge about the interference
2700.63,3.66,constraints in this particular auction
2702.46,3.18,setting then you can usually get the
2704.29,3.9,desired performance so just a few
2705.64,4.56,seconds to solve really reasonable size
2708.19,3.84,set problems so that's a third
2710.2,4.05,ingredient from computer science which
2712.03,4.5,is really kind of a necessary condition
2714.25,7.29,for this auction format to be
2716.53,7.16,practically viable okay how much time to
2721.54,2.15,F
2727.22,7.93,ten minutes or 15 minutes or something
2730.68,7.2,okay all right so let me just what do
2735.15,4.62,you say five is better
2737.88,3.54,five is better okay five is better I'll
2739.77,4.95,skip this part I'll just mention this
2741.42,5.22,briefly at the end okay all right so
2744.72,3.12,that was the second vignette and so the
2746.64,3.36,goal of this thing yet was to show you
2747.84,3.6,how computer science ideas have been
2750.0,3.21,influencing not only the theory of
2751.44,3.81,economics but also the practice of
2753.21,3.54,economics so again the high-level
2755.25,3.69,auction design even though it's
2756.75,4.35,motivated by incentive issues the
2758.94,3.87,precursor actually emerged from work
2761.1,3.78,inspired by computational efficiency
2762.81,3.75,considerations you know design and
2764.88,4.38,greedy heuristics about how to decrease
2766.56,3.809,prices that's bread-and-butter kind of
2769.26,2.64,techniques that come out of
2770.369,3.721,approximation algorithms that come out
2771.9,5.61,of theoretical computer science and then
2774.09,5.22,fast relatively fast exact Sat solvers
2777.51,4.23,was also crucial for the by Villa the
2779.31,3.51,viability of that format one thing I
2781.74,3.81,skipped and I'll just mention very
2782.82,4.77,briefly is that in the forward part of
2785.55,3.93,the auction there's a lot of folklore
2787.59,4.08,understanding and economics about which
2789.48,4.41,auction designs work well which options
2791.67,3.99,design don't work well so for example
2793.89,3.39,can you do can you get away with simple
2795.66,3.81,auctions or do you need much more
2797.28,4.589,complex auctions with additional
2799.47,4.8,features such as package bidding and so
2801.869,4.651,there's a lot of empirical rules of
2804.27,4.53,thumb but really theoretic computer
2806.52,4.16,science gives the vocabulary to turn
2808.8,4.77,those empirical rules of thumb into
2810.68,4.8,theorems so for example one rule of
2813.57,4.47,thumb is that when items have
2815.48,4.09,complementarities so this means you have
2818.04,3.54,a bunch of items where you don't have a
2819.57,3.6,lot of value for them individually but
2821.58,4.44,you do have a lot of value for them in
2823.17,4.68,concert so think about say a telecom who
2826.02,3.72,has a business plan which only makes
2827.85,4.38,sense if it gets coverage all across the
2829.74,4.74,US and really as business plan Falls to
2832.23,4.92,pieces if it has just spotty coverage
2834.48,4.83,all over the nation so now if you have a
2837.15,3.84,budget independent auctions it's really
2839.31,3.33,hard to pull off bidding in them because
2840.99,3.36,you need to simultaneously win in all of
2842.64,3.87,them if you win in only half of them
2844.35,3.75,it's a total disaster so that's why
2846.51,3.599,auctions can be hard when items can be
2848.1,3.36,confident have complementarities it's
2850.109,3.541,hard to coordinate the outcomes of
2851.46,3.78,multiple independent auctions so the
2853.65,3.84,rule of thumb in the field then is that
2855.24,4.809,you really need complicated auctions if
2857.49,4.119,you want to be able to have good outcome
2860.049,2.88,when you have these complementarities
2861.609,3.36,among items but again it was not
2862.929,3.991,previously a theorem it can be made a
2864.969,3.09,theorem and it builds on a field of
2866.92,3.059,theoretical Peter science known as
2868.059,3.39,communication complexity so it's
2869.979,3.421,historically thought of as a you know a
2871.449,3.54,pretty hard core part of theoretical
2873.4,3.809,pure science but it turns out it's
2874.989,4.29,exactly the right tool for making
2877.209,4.171,precise these well known rules of thumb
2879.279,8.55,among practitioners in these kinds of
2881.38,8.339,commercial auctions okay so let me go
2887.829,4.35,back to a sort of more theoretical even
2889.719,5.911,almost sort of philosophical example to
2892.179,5.58,conclude so let me return to Nash's
2895.63,6.709,theorem which I mentioned early on in
2897.759,8.1,the talk I mentioned how in some sense
2902.339,5.081,this theorem gave game theorists and
2905.859,3.061,economists who are using game theory
2907.42,4.319,everything that they wanted in the form
2908.92,4.589,of a sweeping Universal existence
2911.739,4.08,theorem and indeed I mean this this
2913.509,4.5,theorem is so general it honestly it
2915.819,4.74,spoils you if you work in game theory
2918.009,4.86,because it just sets the bar so high for
2920.559,3.75,the applicability of any other result so
2922.869,2.761,I don't even know anything about your
2924.309,4.111,game as long as I know it's finite I
2925.63,4.939,know there's a there's an equilibrium so
2928.42,3.689,that's great but for many of the usual
2930.569,3.13,interpretations of a Nash equilibrium
2932.109,4.47,from any of the reasons why you might
2933.699,5.15,care about Nash equilibria it's not
2936.579,5.1,enough to just know that it exists
2938.849,5.11,ultimately somebody maybe the players
2941.679,4.32,themselves or maybe some helper a
2943.959,3.931,designer or a mediator is gonna be
2945.999,3.96,responsible for figuring out what one of
2947.89,3.839,these equilibria are okay the players
2949.959,3.57,have to know what to play either by
2951.729,4.11,discovering it themselves or by being
2953.529,4.141,told by some third party okay but some
2955.839,4.59,boundedly rational agent has to figure
2957.67,4.559,out what this equilibrium is so what
2960.429,3.84,we'd really like is we'd like a sort of
2962.229,3.45,more constructive version of Nash's
2964.269,4.02,theorem which indicates not just
2965.679,7.86,existence but how might one figure out
2968.289,6.69,how to play so Nash's original proof
2973.539,3.3,actually had two proofs but they were
2974.979,3.87,both based on fixed point theorems and
2976.839,3.45,so those have a non constructive nature
2978.849,4.01,that don't really give any clues about
2980.289,5.101,about how to have a constructive version
2982.859,6.7,so this has been a this was a major open
2985.39,5.76,question for a long time and evidence
2989.559,2.961,started amassing that maybe there could
2991.15,3.77,not be
2992.52,4.68,Universal efficiently efficient
2994.92,4.29,computation a fish on the computable
2997.2,3.629,version of Nash's theorem the first
2999.21,3.72,instance I know of of someone really
3000.829,4.141,shining a spotlight on this question and
3002.93,5.04,also sort of raising alarm bells was
3004.97,4.29,Michael Rabin in a paper in 1957 so a
3007.97,2.79,computer scientist and the audience will
3009.26,3.21,already know many reasons why Michael
3010.76,3.45,Ravens sort of a hero of computer
3012.47,3.629,science for his work in atomic theory
3014.21,3.57,randomized algorithms cryptography and
3016.099,4.411,so on I guess it's probably not that
3017.78,4.89,many of you know that in 1957 he wrote a
3020.51,4.829,paper on the intractability of computing
3022.67,4.53,Nash equilibria but he did so he says
3025.339,3.631,it's quite obvious that not all games
3027.2,3.899,can you know captured by the theory
3028.97,4.05,encompassed in theory can actually be
3031.099,4.98,realistically played by human beings
3033.02,5.849,remember 57 is well before we had NP
3036.079,4.621,completeness 15 years before right so
3038.869,3.48,what could he have meant by sort of an
3040.7,3.96,intractable result well we did have
3042.349,3.99,undecidability in the sense of girdle
3044.66,3.929,and Turing and that's what Raven meant
3046.339,3.75,so he exhibited a game okay we're
3048.589,3.721,actually the there was account it was
3050.089,4.02,accountably infinite action spaces where
3052.31,3.42,it was easy to prove the existence of a
3054.109,3.391,Nash equilibrium but you could also
3055.73,3.33,prove that there was no decidable
3057.5,3.75,procedure that would give you that
3059.06,4.62,equilibrium okay so this showed that
3061.25,3.81,there could be big gaps between the
3063.68,3.63,types of existence theorems that could
3065.06,4.94,be shown and the types of constructive
3067.31,4.92,existence theorems that could be shown
3070.0,3.79,then later we did have NP completeness
3072.23,3.99,and we could prove intractability
3073.79,4.68,results for finite games like the ones
3076.22,5.609,that are squarely in the domain of
3078.47,4.68,Nash's theorem so Gilboa and Zemel
3081.829,3.121,proved that various decision problems
3083.15,3.66,around Nash equilibria or np-complete
3084.95,3.18,and there have a sequence of results
3086.81,3.75,showing that at least particular
3088.13,4.32,algorithms for example algorithms that
3090.56,4.049,attempt to quickly learn Nash equilibria
3092.45,6.11,are doomed to fail do not in general
3094.609,6.391,work in a computationally efficient way
3098.56,4.24,so this sounds like it's right in the
3101.0,2.97,wheelhouse now of computational
3102.8,3.9,complexity theory you have a
3103.97,6.09,computational problem namely given a
3106.7,5.909,game find a Nash equilibrium we know one
3110.06,4.2,exists and we're starting to believe
3112.609,3.871,that may be an efficient algorithm
3114.26,4.23,doesn't exist and again this is what
3116.48,2.79,many people in the community basically
3118.49,2.07,do for a living
3119.27,3.18,prove these kinds of intractability
3120.56,3.509,results and the first thing one thinks
3122.45,2.3,about oh maybe this is another one of
3124.069,2.751,those NP
3124.75,5.31,complete problems okay like I mentioned
3126.82,5.57,earlier but the answer is actually a
3130.06,5.88,little bit trickier than that
3132.39,5.92,so megiddo pointed out that's actually
3135.94,3.6,Nash equilibria are not np-complete at
3138.31,2.91,least understand the complexity
3139.54,3.36,assumptions and it's because there's
3141.22,4.23,almost a sort of type checking error
3142.9,4.74,between Nash equilibria and typical
3145.45,4.14,np-complete problems so remember what a
3147.64,4.62,typical np-complete problem looks like I
3149.59,5.1,want to know in the facebook graph are
3152.26,4.41,there a hundred people who are all
3154.69,3.24,friends with each other this is called a
3156.67,3.66,clique is there a clique of a hundred
3157.93,5.07,people in the facebook graph the answer
3160.33,4.41,might be yes the answer might be no and
3163.0,4.38,I want an algorithm an algorithm to tell
3164.74,4.44,me which is which now if I give you a
3167.38,4.2,game and I tell you to find a Nash
3169.18,3.63,equilibria it's not a question of
3171.58,3.15,whether or not there is a Nash
3172.81,3.42,equilibrium to be found we know the
3174.73,4.86,answer Nash told us the answer the
3176.23,6.12,answer is yes the only difficulty only
3179.59,4.38,difficulty is in finding it okay so
3182.35,3.3,because of this lack of a binary
3183.97,3.72,decision problem underlying Nash
3185.65,4.08,equilibrium computation it is in a
3187.69,3.69,provable sense not as difficult as
3189.73,5.51,np-complete problems because there's
3191.38,6.45,guaranteed existence of a solution so
3195.24,5.5,Papadimitriou then proposed to have a
3197.83,4.95,refined version of NP to say okay so
3200.74,3.42,maybe we can't prove that computing Nash
3202.78,3.21,equilibria is as hard as all this other
3204.16,3.54,stuff but maybe we can at least prove
3205.99,4.2,that it's as hard as all the other
3207.7,4.65,problems that have guaranteed existence
3210.19,4.32,because of a fixed point argument okay
3212.35,4.14,like brower's fixed points and several
3214.51,4.55,other problems okay so that's a
3216.49,6.26,refinement of the complexity class NP
3219.06,8.64,papademetriou decided to call it PP ad
3222.75,7.48,so allegedly allegedly this stands for
3227.7,4.95,polynomial parity argument directed
3230.23,2.42,version
3240.25,5.65,christos a strata convinced me that he
3242.3,5.04,was unaware that this was a substring of
3245.9,3.51,the first five letters of his last name
3247.34,4.7,when he proposed it but if you believe
3249.41,6.33,that I've got a bridge to sell you
3252.04,5.59,so the 94 proposal was to say look if
3255.74,3.39,computing Nash equilibria is going to be
3257.63,2.82,intractable and we want to prove its
3259.13,3.42,complete for some complexity class
3260.45,3.93,here's a proposal for what that class
3262.55,3.03,should be okay so that was just a
3264.38,2.46,proposal there was not a proof of
3265.58,3.84,intractability it was just really a
3266.84,4.77,program for in tractability and it took
3269.42,5.42,more than ten years but it was indeed
3271.61,6.03,proven okay mid last decade that indeed
3274.84,5.71,computing a Nash equilibrium is as hard
3277.64,4.47,as any other problem with guaranteed
3280.55,1.92,existence coming from a fixed point
3282.11,2.7,theorem
3282.47,3.81,okay so formally this is a ppat complete
3284.81,3.03,problem okay so it's like np-complete
3286.28,3.18,but with this technical distinction
3287.84,3.87,because of the guaranteed existence of
3289.46,4.14,solutions this is a difficult result the
3291.71,4.17,proofs are real tour de force Duskull
3293.6,5.88,Optus goldberg papadimitriou chen Deng
3295.88,6.06,and tang as far as how to interpret this
3299.48,4.53,I mean this is the way we would in
3301.94,4.77,theoretical pure science make precise
3304.01,4.95,what up till now had been sort of more
3306.71,4.86,of a folklore belief that there cannot
3308.96,4.62,be a constructive version of Nash's
3311.57,4.95,theorem that has as sweeping
3313.58,5.12,universality as the existence okay so
3316.52,5.73,Nash proved Nash equilibria always exist
3318.7,4.99,assuming P is different than P P ad that
3322.25,3.9,cannot be the case that there is
3323.69,4.26,universal efficient computation of Nash
3326.15,5.94,equilibria okay that's the meaning of
3327.95,6.15,this result okay so in particular if you
3332.09,3.63,want a constructive version of Nash's
3334.1,3.81,theorem just like with np-complete
3335.72,4.56,problems you have to make compromises
3337.91,3.57,and again in theoretical your science we
3340.28,3.42,have many ideas for how you can
3341.48,3.33,compromise you have approximation for
3343.7,2.28,equilibrium computation more
3344.81,3.03,realistically you probably want to
3345.98,2.91,narrow the domain okay so you probably
3347.84,3.54,want to look at games that are either
3348.89,4.05,not too big or have extra special
3351.38,3.36,structure where it's easier to
3352.94,6.66,understand and compute what the Nash
3354.74,7.14,equilibria might be so what did we get
3359.6,4.59,from the computational lens applying it
3361.88,3.86,squarely to the fundamental concept of
3364.19,4.61,Nash equilibria
3365.74,4.619,well you know what is what is not a new
3368.8,3.75,idea is the idea that the Nash
3370.359,4.321,equilibria has problems okay there's a
3372.55,3.9,long list of well-known criticisms of
3374.68,3.51,the Nash equilibrium concept for example
3376.45,3.24,already the fact that it's not unique
3378.19,2.97,you can have lots and lots of Nash
3379.69,4.169,equilibria in different games that
3381.16,4.86,already makes its predictive power not
3383.859,4.711,as sweeping as one might like okay so
3386.02,4.29,there are many criticisms but the
3388.57,3.87,computational lens has highlighted
3390.31,3.75,really an orthogonal and I think novel
3392.44,3.659,type of criticism of the Nash
3394.06,3.33,equilibrium concept again it doesn't
3396.099,2.731,mean it should be removed from the
3397.39,3.75,pedestal of being the fundamental
3398.83,4.17,equilibrium concept it just means it's
3401.14,3.32,just sort of advice about when it makes
3403.0,4.56,sense and when it doesn't make sense and
3404.46,4.81,the critique is that even with all of
3407.56,3.99,the setting all the other criticisms
3409.27,4.349,aside that predictive power is
3411.55,3.51,diminished by the fact that we can't
3413.619,3.811,have confidence that down at the
3415.06,3.48,rational agents or designer can actually
3417.43,2.85,figure out what one of these Nash
3418.54,3.569,equilibria is at least not in the
3420.28,4.17,general case ok so again in specific
3422.109,3.931,domains you get a positive results but
3424.45,5.93,you cannot have a general purpose
3426.04,4.34,constructive version of Nash's theorem
3430.41,6.1,ok so just to wrap up quickly so I've
3434.14,4.89,given you a highly non exhaustive but I
3436.51,3.93,hope representative set of the
3439.03,2.91,interactions that have been taking place
3440.44,3.63,on the boundary of computer science and
3441.94,3.72,economics over the past 15 years and I
3444.07,3.6,really don't think this is some fad I
3445.66,4.8,mean the interaction that's happening is
3447.67,4.02,only accelerating as we speak and I
3450.46,2.909,think it makes sense these are two
3451.69,3.33,communities that have a lot to benefit
3453.369,3.271,from each other and indeed you know
3455.02,4.29,arguably even need each other to a
3456.64,4.5,certain degree computer science right
3459.31,3.87,many of the 21st century applications
3461.14,4.229,that were struggling with really require
3463.18,3.6,economic reasoning to make good sense of
3465.369,3.211,them I tried to highlight this with a
3466.78,3.12,network routing application but if you
3468.58,2.97,look at the big data companies you look
3469.9,3.63,at Microsoft and Google they now have
3471.55,4.08,positions called chief economist okay up
3473.53,3.6,toward the top grass of the company so
3475.63,2.43,this is really I think a well understood
3477.13,3.2,new thing
3478.06,5.37,computer science needs economic advice
3480.33,4.509,in the other direction theoretical
3483.43,4.86,computer science is really uniquely
3484.839,5.491,situated to articulate computational
3488.29,4.079,intractability when it exists and
3490.33,4.08,whether we like it or not it exists
3492.369,4.261,pretty broadly in the world whether
3494.41,4.12,you're trying to run some auction at
3496.63,3.76,large scale like in the FCC
3498.53,3.66,auction or whether you're just trying to
3500.39,3.81,understand whether or not equilibria are
3502.19,3.63,generally going to be realized in games
3504.2,5.04,like we saw in the previous application
3505.82,7.44,with ppat completeness but the good news
3509.24,5.76,is is because of our long history coping
3513.26,3.72,with intractability we have a lot of
3515.0,3.78,ways of getting around it a lot of ways
3516.98,3.69,to still make progress and get insights
3518.78,3.78,into fundamental models even when
3520.67,4.88,there's intractability there so I'll
3522.56,2.99,leave you with that thanks
