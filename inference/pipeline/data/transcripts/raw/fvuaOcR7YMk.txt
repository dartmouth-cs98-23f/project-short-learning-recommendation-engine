0.359,5.161,hello and welcome to another episode of
2.28,4.86,video analytics 101 today we're talking
5.52,3.119,about all these passwords and how they
7.14,2.999,connect artificial intelligence deep
8.639,2.521,learning machine learning computer
10.139,2.681,vision
11.16,10.199,so let's Dive Right In
12.82,10.76,[Music]
21.359,4.021,all right so let's unpack all these
23.58,5.1,different buzzwords and let's start off
25.38,5.28,with artificial intelligence everybody's
28.68,4.74,talking about it but actually it's quite
30.66,6.059,old it started in the 1960s and really
33.42,5.58,defines agents that get input from their
36.719,3.721,environment and act upon it and
39.0,2.76,depending on where we are in this
40.44,4.619,development it means different things
41.76,5.819,back then in the 60s it meant building a
45.059,4.921,simple chatbot that reacts to text input
47.579,3.741,and gets gets you an answer and you
49.98,4.2,might even think that it's a human
51.32,5.739,nowadays we mean all kinds of stuff of
54.18,5.039,our devices measuring us and reacting to
57.059,4.261,it and do stuff for us and in the future
59.219,4.5,we might really mean artificial general
61.32,4.14,intelligence so really computers that
63.719,3.841,are like humans and really think
65.46,4.32,intelligently but we are very very far
67.56,4.739,away from this today we really mean
69.78,5.04,automation so measuring the environment
72.299,4.441,and measuring what's happening and then
74.82,3.54,automating stuff based on it so that's
76.74,4.739,artificial intelligence the thing that
78.36,5.04,we all talk about all the time AI
81.479,3.421,now let's talk about something that we
83.4,3.96,don't talk so much about that's computer
84.9,4.74,vision but computer vision is all around
87.36,4.259,us computer vision is the field that
89.64,5.7,deals with the problem of making
91.619,6.841,machines see so you get an input of a
95.34,5.7,video a an image and so on and you try
98.46,4.68,to find ways how the machine could
101.04,3.84,interpret this and really see what is
103.14,4.68,happening out there good example is
104.88,6.18,Quality Inspection in manufacturing so
107.82,5.52,if you are producing bottles for example
111.06,3.839,you might use computer vision to verify
113.34,3.419,that the quality is okay and detect any
114.899,3.601,faults so this is a very typical example
116.759,3.061,it's not necessarily artificial
118.5,4.38,intelligence but it's also computer
119.82,4.68,vision but what is computer vision and
122.88,4.28,artificial intelligence is for example
124.5,5.759,making robot C that's where these two
127.16,6.34,overlap but they don't overlap 100 it's
130.259,6.06,really part of the things overlap
133.5,5.16,and now the Third Field is machine
136.319,4.621,learning machine learning also is around
138.66,4.14,for a very long time but recently has
140.94,5.34,been more prominent
142.8,4.74,and that's the idea of training systems
146.28,4.319,automatically
147.54,4.919,and letting them learn things to detect
150.599,4.321,things and react to things
152.459,3.841,and this is an approach that that is
154.92,4.14,being used more and more where we don't
156.3,4.32,have to Define everything explicitly but
159.06,2.7,it's really learning so we use data to
160.62,3.839,train it
161.76,4.619,and finally the thing that is used a lot
164.459,4.621,nowadays is called Deep learning and
166.379,5.041,deep learning is a subfield of machine
169.08,4.519,learning where we introduce the idea of
171.42,4.44,using vast amount of data to basically
173.599,4.601,completely automate the training process
175.86,4.26,we don't even have to tell it what it
178.2,3.899,should learn it really learns
180.12,5.46,automatically and deep learning and
182.099,4.801,machine learning are used everywhere and
185.58,2.82,part of it is being used in our
186.9,3.3,artificial intelligence but there are
188.4,3.78,other applications where it's not
190.2,3.959,artificial intelligence so again those
192.18,4.68,are fields that are overlapping but are
194.159,4.921,not overlapping 100 same thing with
196.86,4.019,computer vision so of course we use
199.08,3.6,machine learning and deep learning why
200.879,3.541,do we want to detect a person or a
202.68,3.779,vehicle so that's where we use deep
204.42,4.38,learning with computer vision or for
206.459,3.661,computer vision or as technology of
208.8,3.42,computer vision
210.12,3.96,but if we use machine learning for
212.22,3.78,natural language processing of course
214.08,3.6,that's not part of computer vision
216.0,3.36,but it is part of artificial
217.68,3.66,intelligence so that's where you see all
219.36,4.5,of these things really overlap in Venn
221.34,5.22,diagrams it's not a subset of each other
223.86,6.42,it's really overlapping fields
226.56,5.399,and in video Analytics we are exactly in
230.28,4.44,the middle and in this intersection of
231.959,4.681,all of this so video analytics nowadays
234.72,3.84,when we talk about it it's exactly the
236.64,4.8,intersection where deep learning
238.56,4.62,intersects with computer vision and it
241.44,3.54,intersects with artificial intelligence
243.18,4.02,this is the field that we're talking
244.98,4.14,about it's not a subset of all of this
247.2,4.619,it's read all these intersections of
249.12,4.679,these three to four Fields how to
251.819,4.021,interact together
253.799,4.201,I hope this explanation gave you a good
255.84,3.959,overview of what artificial intelligence
258.0,4.5,is what computer vision is what machine
259.799,5.161,learning is and what deep learning is so
262.5,4.979,we can all talk about the same things in
264.96,4.86,the same language if you enjoyed this

269.82,19.33,otherwise see you next time
