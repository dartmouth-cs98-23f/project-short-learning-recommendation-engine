0.08,3.68,hey guys welcome to the channel if
1.839,3.44,you're new here my name is anar and i'm
3.76,3.2,a self-taught software developer
5.279,3.28,so in this video i'm going to talk about
6.96,3.44,moving from quality assurance to
8.559,3.361,software development first i want to go
10.4,2.159,into some reasons why you might want to
11.92,2.08,do this
12.559,3.441,and then i'll talk about how you could
14.0,3.279,do this and how i actually did it myself
16.0,2.72,so let's start with the why
17.279,3.201,why do you want to become a software
18.72,3.68,developer there tends to be a perceived
20.48,3.52,prestige with software development some
22.4,3.199,also think that moving from software
24.0,2.72,testing to software development will
25.599,3.44,increase their salaries
26.72,4.16,now these reasons are fairly superficial
29.039,3.2,and if you're considering a move from
30.88,2.24,quality assurance to software
32.239,2.241,development
33.12,3.119,first you need to make sure that you're
34.48,3.28,doing it for the right reason the only
36.239,2.48,reasons you should consider moving into
37.76,2.799,software development
38.719,3.121,is if you either enjoy coding or you
40.559,2.641,enjoy solving problems
41.84,3.039,because that's what your everyday is
43.2,3.359,going to look like if you don't enjoy
44.879,2.16,programming or you don't enjoy solving
46.559,1.68,problems
47.039,2.721,you're not going to be happy and
48.239,3.041,therefore you're not going to excel and
49.76,2.639,become a good software developer
51.28,3.279,and even if you go back to those
52.399,3.761,superficial reasons such as salary
54.559,3.601,you're not actually going to make more
56.16,3.6,money than a good quality assurance
58.16,2.239,professional if you're a bad software
59.76,2.16,developer
60.399,3.601,so let's talk about the how how do you
61.92,3.12,go from qa or software tester to
64.0,2.799,software developer
65.04,4.079,step one is kind of obvious you have to
66.799,3.921,learn to code learn programming basics
69.119,3.441,and programming fundamentals
70.72,3.84,don't do some sort of course on udemy
72.56,2.8,that covers a web framework like react
74.56,3.199,or spring
75.36,4.16,or nodejs pick a simple programming
77.759,2.881,language like python or javascript
79.52,2.8,and learn it to the point where you
80.64,3.6,could write basic scripts with it maybe
82.32,3.439,a program that sums two numbers or gives
84.24,3.12,you a random number every hour something
85.759,3.761,along those lines you want to make sure
87.36,4.399,you understand classes methods functions
89.52,3.52,variables loops those underlying things
91.759,2.0,that are common in most programming
93.04,2.16,languages
93.759,3.281,once you have a basic grasp of a
95.2,2.559,programming language apply it to test
97.04,2.719,automation
97.759,3.921,this is something i did myself i came in
99.759,3.281,as a qa tester to a company that had
101.68,2.88,zero test automation
103.04,2.8,and i essentially started the test
104.56,2.16,automation framework and started
105.84,2.4,building upon it
106.72,2.88,don't be afraid to ask for help i had
108.24,1.839,some developers help me out in the
109.6,2.08,beginning
110.079,3.281,it was a lot to learn and if you have
111.68,2.32,decent co-workers chances are they'll be
113.36,2.399,happy to lend
114.0,3.759,a hand if there already is some sort of
115.759,3.921,test automation setup fantastic
117.759,3.521,take an active role in it contribute to
119.68,2.64,it kind of seek opportunities to
121.28,3.04,actually work on it
122.32,3.52,as you contribute to it more and more as
124.32,2.799,you write more and more test scripts
125.84,2.479,you're going to notice that you get
127.119,2.721,better at programming
128.319,3.041,some things that used to throw you for a
129.84,2.479,loop that used to be confusing they just
131.36,2.72,come naturally
132.319,3.441,now your early quote is going to be bad
134.08,2.72,and that's okay everybody has really bad
135.76,2.479,code in the beginning
136.8,3.68,once you actually get comfortable
138.239,2.801,writing test scripts revisit your old
140.48,2.08,code
141.04,2.96,the really early code where you just
142.56,1.92,started and see what you could make
144.0,2.64,better
144.48,3.839,consistently revisiting your old code is
146.64,3.44,going to build good habits and generally
148.319,3.681,make you a better programmer take that
150.08,3.2,test automation project seriously
152.0,2.959,there's really two ways you could go
153.28,3.92,about it you could just say hey
154.959,4.0,i'm in qa programming is not my primary
157.2,3.039,job i'm going to take this script from
158.959,2.961,somewhere i found online
160.239,3.841,copy and paste it maybe change some
161.92,3.599,things and if it works that'll be it
164.08,3.12,if i need to do something similar i'll
165.519,3.44,just copy and paste it again while
167.2,2.96,that'll work that's not the attitude you
168.959,2.401,should have if you're planning to move
170.16,2.88,into software development
171.36,4.0,the second way is to take the project
173.04,4.16,seriously to try to apply principles of
175.36,2.32,programming and principles of good code
177.2,2.56,design
177.68,3.04,one of those principles is dry don't
179.76,2.479,repeat yourself
180.72,3.28,which essentially means don't copy and
182.239,3.681,paste any code if you see some code
184.0,3.2,that could be reusable take that code
185.92,3.039,and put it into a function
187.2,3.28,use proper names read up on naming
188.959,2.241,conventions for variables and for
190.48,3.039,functions
191.2,3.28,and basically try your best to write
193.519,2.561,quality code
194.48,2.96,it doesn't have to be perfect but as
196.08,1.92,long as you keep trying and you keep
197.44,2.159,iterating
198.0,3.04,it's going to build good habits
199.599,3.36,something that's going to help organize
201.04,3.52,your code very well as well is a design
202.959,2.881,pattern so when i first started writing
204.56,3.039,automated test scripts
205.84,3.6,i followed some blog and my scripts were
207.599,3.521,kind of all over the place later on i
209.44,3.28,had a developer actually help me set the
211.12,3.199,project up so it followed a strict
212.72,2.32,design pattern and it became a lot more
214.319,1.92,manageable
215.04,2.64,i would recommend talking to your
216.239,2.881,software development colleagues this
217.68,2.96,isn't going to take them a lot of time
219.12,3.199,and i'm sure they'll be happy to help
220.64,3.519,okay so let's say you reach this point
222.319,3.041,where you have this well built out test
224.159,2.64,automation framework
225.36,3.439,you don't really feel like there's much
226.799,3.761,left to learn this passive state you're
228.799,3.36,in now where you're just writing things
230.56,3.12,mechanically because you're familiar
232.159,2.321,with everything that goes into test
233.68,3.119,automation
234.48,4.16,and this is something you don't like
236.799,2.401,then software development is definitely
238.64,2.08,for you
239.2,3.2,this is a typical response from a
240.72,3.12,software developer software developers
242.4,3.039,hate being bored they hate doing
243.84,2.319,mechanical tasks they hate doing the
245.439,2.481,same thing
246.159,3.28,they always chase heart problems or new
247.92,3.2,problems or new technologies
249.439,3.281,the next thing i would recommend you do
251.12,3.28,is build a personal project
252.72,3.68,this actually doesn't have to happen
254.4,3.519,after you master test automation
256.4,3.2,but i think it will help because a lot
257.919,2.961,of the skills will carry over and there
259.6,2.319,will be new things to learn in this
260.88,2.879,personal project
261.919,3.121,so it won't be a complete uphill battle
263.759,2.641,because there will be things you'll
265.04,2.96,be able to transfer from the test
266.4,3.12,automation and it won't be boring
268.0,2.479,because there will be all this web stuff
269.52,2.48,that you can now learn
270.479,3.601,so what i did and what i would recommend
272.0,3.84,you do is pick a personal project that's
274.08,2.72,kind of relevant to the application at
275.84,2.32,your work
276.8,3.36,and this is what i mean i'll give my
278.16,3.84,work application and the application i
280.16,4.08,built as an example so the application
282.0,3.12,of my workplace is essentially a bunch
284.24,3.679,of charts
285.12,4.48,widgets and visualized data so i also
287.919,3.441,had a bit of an interest in stocks
289.6,4.319,so i decided to build an application
291.36,4.72,that visualizes data for stock prices
293.919,3.601,i created widgets i created charts i
296.08,2.88,also created a database for my
297.52,3.92,application which helped things like
298.96,4.0,usernames passwords and stock symbols i
301.44,2.479,actually really enjoyed this project i
302.96,2.4,got really into it
303.919,3.441,and i added functionality where you
305.36,3.44,could log in and actually buy and trade
307.36,2.88,stocks with made up money
308.8,3.52,this is what's known as paper trading
310.24,3.44,you could open an account save deposit
312.32,2.719,ten thousand dollars but you're not
313.68,3.04,actually depositing anything
315.039,3.281,and then you could search up real stocks
316.72,2.0,and buy real stocks with this made up
318.32,1.92,money
318.72,2.96,then you could log back in the next day
320.24,2.72,or later that day and the widgets would
321.68,2.799,tell you if the stock went up if the
322.96,3.519,stock went down what your portfolio
324.479,3.601,looks like etc a lot of these additional
326.479,2.961,features were implemented just because i
328.08,2.559,wanted to implement them and because i
329.44,2.88,was having fun doing so
330.639,3.601,but the value that this brought was i
332.32,3.599,was able to go to my direct manager and
334.24,3.519,actually show him an application
335.919,3.441,he was pretty impressed that a software
337.759,3.521,tester essentially put together an
339.36,3.679,application that looked a lot like the
341.28,3.359,application we had at our company and as
343.039,2.641,the saying goes a picture is worth a
344.639,2.881,thousand words
345.68,3.76,of course it was much less complex but
347.52,3.679,it looked the part it had charts with
349.44,3.199,very similar looking data plotted on
351.199,3.601,very similar looking charts
352.639,3.041,you were able to log in log out and at
354.8,2.56,the end of the day
355.68,3.2,you're comparing something that was
357.36,2.16,built by somebody just new to
358.88,2.08,programming
359.52,2.88,versus something that's built by
360.96,2.239,something like 20 or 30 software
362.4,2.32,developers
363.199,3.201,so even the fact that there was a bit of
364.72,3.36,a resemblance was impressive to my
366.4,3.519,direct manager and i think this really
368.08,3.679,did play a key role in showing that i
369.919,2.801,could do the job and i was willing and
371.759,2.72,able to actually
372.72,3.039,push myself learn the things that needed
374.479,3.201,to be learned and
375.759,3.121,do the work talking to your manager and
377.68,3.12,just telling him you want to be a
378.88,3.52,software developer might come off like
380.8,2.88,maybe you heard it was cool somewhere or
382.4,2.639,something along those lines
383.68,2.959,but actually putting in the work and
385.039,3.121,presenting it paints a different picture
386.639,2.321,this leads me directly into my next
388.16,2.64,point which is
388.96,3.12,approach your manager express your
390.8,2.0,newfound interest in software
392.08,2.64,development
392.8,3.6,be polite you were hard to be a software
394.72,2.4,tester after all not a software
396.4,2.239,developer
397.12,3.199,continue doing your job and doing your
398.639,2.241,job well show that you are a good
400.319,2.32,employee
400.88,3.52,being demanding and slacking off at this
402.639,3.28,point is only going to make things worse
404.4,3.44,but at the same time make sure you get
405.919,4.161,an answer make sure you get either an
407.84,3.919,answer for when this is going to happen
410.08,3.679,if it is going to happen if it can
411.759,3.921,happen or some sort of action plan
413.759,3.121,which will take you from software tester
415.68,2.639,to software developer
416.88,2.96,if it is expressed that there is no
418.319,3.361,opportunity for you to transition to
419.84,3.44,software development within the company
421.68,3.28,it may be worthwhile looking outside of
423.28,3.28,your company the good news there is you
424.96,2.72,have professional experience programming
426.56,1.84,from building out all the test
427.68,2.16,automation
428.4,3.28,and you have a personal project to
429.84,3.28,showcase your web development skills
431.68,3.2,these two things are going to work in
433.12,2.96,your favor when looking for a job and it
434.88,2.48,will definitely make you a better
436.08,3.04,candidate than when you were first
437.36,3.2,starting off i actually wouldn't shy
439.12,3.199,away from showing off your test
440.56,3.52,automation because software developers
442.319,3.121,actually like testing skills
444.08,2.959,it may sound like a long difficult
445.44,3.28,journey but it's well worth it if you
