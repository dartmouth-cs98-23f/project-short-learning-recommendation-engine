2.96,3.76,artificial intelligence is making rapid
5.44,2.96,strides
6.72,3.2,there's talk of a new evolution that
8.4,5.119,could fundamentally change
9.92,5.04,life on our planet artificial
13.519,4.241,intelligence has the potential to
14.96,5.84,revolutionize every aspect of daily life
17.76,5.2,work mobility medicine the economy and
20.8,4.319,communication
22.96,4.399,but will ai really make medicine better
25.119,4.32,and doctors superfluous
27.359,4.08,when will self-driving cars hit our
29.439,4.721,roads
31.439,4.481,will intelligent robots usurp our jobs
34.16,5.84,and are we heading for a dystopia
35.92,6.56,with no privacy and total surveillance
40.0,5.76,what exactly is artificial intelligence
42.48,5.52,and how much can it really do
45.76,5.279,what will change and what will remain
48.0,3.039,pure fantasy
53.44,3.439,to answer these questions we embarked on
55.68,3.199,an exciting journey

100.32,4.64,new startup companies launch every day
103.2,4.72,rents have exploded and artificial

249.56,5.959,[Music]
253.2,3.039,i want to know how will artificial
255.519,3.68,intelligence
256.239,2.96,change medicine
261.44,3.36,researchers here have developed an
263.04,2.48,artificial intelligence algorithm that
264.8,3.76,can screen
265.52,5.52,x-rays for certain diseases computer
268.56,4.24,scientist pranav rajpurkar shows me how
271.04,3.439,easy it is to use
272.8,3.679,take a picture of an x-ray with your
274.479,3.921,mobile phone upload the image
276.479,4.401,and a few seconds later you get the
278.4,5.2,diagnosis
280.88,3.44,it's a mass and it's saying this thing
283.6,3.84,over here
284.32,4.56,is a possibly cancerous lesion and i can
287.44,3.6,see that right over here
288.88,3.44,okay so it gives you if i may have a
291.04,5.12,look at it
292.32,7.36,now probabilities for pneumonia
296.16,4.24,inaudible edema effusion and that goes
299.68,3.2,bank
300.4,4.239,yeah now how does this work i mean how
302.88,3.84,did you get to the point
304.639,3.441,we started with a large data set of
306.72,4.4,chest x-rays
308.08,4.0,which were released by the nih and these
311.12,3.28,contained
312.08,3.2,x-rays and then also labels of different
314.4,2.799,pathologies
315.28,4.0,and whether they existed in those x-rays
317.199,3.601,so it might say okay here's an image and
319.28,3.68,on this image i have
320.8,3.66,pathology one two and three and we had
322.96,3.84,hundred thousand of these images
324.46,5.38,[Music]
326.8,5.119,so we trained a model that can
329.84,4.24,take in it as an input and x-ray and
331.919,4.921,then output the probability of
334.08,5.44,several different pathologies on this
336.84,4.76,x-ray
339.52,4.0,artificial intelligence is modeled on
341.6,5.2,the human brain
343.52,10.32,a gigantic network of almost 100 billion
346.8,7.04,interconnected neurons
354.4,4.0,put in very simple terms this is how a
356.72,4.0,brain cell works
358.4,3.84,incoming impulses are passed in a domino
360.72,5.28,effect from one neuron
362.24,5.92,to the next the resulting circuit
366.0,4.16,connects the neurons and it is this
368.16,3.36,circuit that artificial intelligence
370.16,5.12,tries to simulate
371.52,3.76,as a digital neural network
376.96,4.32,like our brains the network can learn
379.52,4.16,how to identify tuberculosis for
381.28,2.4,instance
383.919,3.201,first the network needs to be trained or
386.16,3.12,taught
387.12,3.919,x-rays of tuberculosis patients are fed
389.28,3.6,to the system
391.039,4.801,initially it struggles to correctly
392.88,2.96,identify the condition
397.199,4.56,but every time an x-ray is fed in the
399.759,5.361,network's structure is adapted
401.759,5.121,and its diagnostic ability improves
405.12,5.68,it takes thousands and thousands of
406.88,3.92,clinical data sets to train the machine
416.4,3.04,only after the network is optimized in
418.72,2.96,this way
419.44,2.77,can it correctly identify an unknown
421.68,6.89,x-ray
422.21,6.36,[Music]
429.68,3.44,but how accurate is artificial
431.44,3.36,intelligence compared to a doctor's
433.12,3.84,expertise
434.8,3.119,we have actually done this test twice at
436.96,4.16,this point
437.919,6.241,once with a set of studies from the
441.12,4.4,nih data set that we had a group of
444.16,3.68,radiologists label
445.52,4.0,and then we compared the accuracy of the
447.84,4.32,model to the radiologist
449.52,5.04,and we found that they were very similar
452.16,3.84,in terms of accuracy on most pathologies
454.56,2.96,on one of them the model was
456.0,2.4,outperforming the radiologists and on
457.52,2.56,three of them
458.4,3.44,the radiologists were outperforming the
460.08,3.76,model and then we repeated the
461.84,3.28,experiment this time using a data set
463.84,3.199,from stanford
465.12,3.359,which we recently released which is 200
467.039,3.6,thousand chest x-rays
468.479,3.041,and then we had a similar setup where we
470.639,3.521,had
471.52,4.56,three sub-specialty radiologists these
474.16,3.759,are very uncommon very trained
476.08,4.32,radiologists to decide what the ground
477.919,3.761,truth for a particular set of images was
480.4,3.199,and then we compared general
481.68,3.359,radiologists to the algorithm at the
483.599,3.201,task and found that they had similar
485.039,3.921,levels of performance
486.8,3.519,so these are all stanford radiologists
488.96,4.38,so so they're
490.319,5.28,they're trained they should be good yeah
493.34,4.18,[Music]
495.599,3.521,reading x-rays accurately is a
497.52,3.76,complicated process
499.12,4.56,but artificial intelligence is making
501.28,3.919,fast progress
503.68,3.68,when it comes to identifying or
505.199,6.72,recognizing simple images
507.36,4.559,computers have surpassed human accuracy
513.039,3.761,now if i look at your picture it's
515.279,4.481,always probability
516.8,3.2,so there are cases where the machine is
519.76,2.48,not
520.0,4.08,really sure what what would be sort of a
522.24,4.96,clear decision to say okay this
524.08,3.92,is i don't know pneumonia or something
527.2,3.12,else yeah
528.0,4.0,i think i mean i think it's good to talk
530.32,4.56,in terms of probabilities
532.0,3.68,because probabilities also give a sense
534.88,3.519,of
535.68,4.159,the algorithm the model's uncertainty on
538.399,2.641,that particular problem
539.839,4.081,i think one difficulty with
541.04,5.68,probabilities is that it does
543.92,5.12,make it hard for humans to interpret
546.72,5.04,like what is the probability of 88
549.04,4.799,versus 92 percent mean in terms of the
551.76,4.4,decision i should make in the clinic
553.839,4.0,and so i think in that sense one of the
556.16,3.44,things that
557.839,2.961,we could experiment with doing in the
559.6,2.4,future is rather than showing
560.8,3.36,probabilities that are so
562.0,3.839,fine-grained maybe we can show things
564.16,3.28,like unlikely
565.839,3.921,or this pathology is likely or this
567.44,5.36,pathology is
569.76,5.12,possible in healthcare
572.8,3.52,artificial intelligence is powering a
574.88,3.2,revolution
576.32,3.84,scientists are using artificial
578.08,3.68,intelligence algorithms to sift through
580.16,3.359,seemingly banal data
581.76,4.56,such as the up and down motion of the
583.519,4.88,steps we take every day
586.32,3.92,they're looking for conspicuous patterns
588.399,3.521,that could serve as early warning signs
590.24,3.36,of disease
591.92,3.12,scientists in the english city of
593.6,5.2,birmingham are working on a
595.04,3.76,revolutionary diagnostic method
600.64,4.4,to date there are no specific tests to
603.279,5.361,detect parkinson's disease
605.04,5.2,making diagnosis difficult ai could
608.64,6.0,change that
610.24,4.4,max little is a mathematician at aston
616.839,3.0,university
620.44,3.439,[Music]
623.92,5.359,very good voice changes can be an early
627.04,4.32,indicator of parkinson's
629.279,3.12,max and his team collected thousands of
631.36,2.479,vocal recordings
632.399,3.12,and fed them to an algorithm they
633.839,3.361,developed which learned to detect
635.519,2.56,differences in voice patterns between
637.2,3.84,people with
638.079,4.721,and without the condition in a lab-based
641.04,3.359,study of the recordings the algorithm
642.8,2.88,was able to correctly identify a
644.399,4.481,parkinson's diagnosis
645.68,5.12,nearly 99 of the time max
648.88,3.68,little's work is an example of the
650.8,3.84,far-reaching changes ai
652.56,3.839,is bringing to the field of medicine
654.64,3.759,it's no longer just doctors who are
656.399,4.0,using artificial intelligence to develop
658.399,2.88,new diagnostic methods but data
660.399,3.781,scientists
661.279,8.721,programmers and mathematicians like max
664.18,8.779,[Music]
670.0,5.04,one example when a person walks sensors
672.959,3.981,in their smartphone register the up and
675.04,3.68,down motion of their gate
676.94,3.94,[Music]
678.72,4.4,but what information can be gleaned from
680.88,4.079,such data
683.12,3.44,if we measured a pattern of someone's
684.959,3.921,walking behavior
686.56,4.0,then someone who's healthy might have we
688.88,3.76,might measure the accelerometer
690.56,3.68,to look like that okay so it's just the
692.64,3.36,sort of movement
694.24,3.52,he would have here yeah the hips going
696.0,7.839,up and down regularly that kind of thing
697.76,6.079,along with their pace
706.24,2.96,but if you looked at somebody with
707.44,4.32,parkinson's disease they may have these
709.2,6.0,small steps like this and they may be
711.76,3.92,irregular or they may have patterns like
715.2,2.56,that
715.68,3.2,or they may even freeze and stop like
717.76,2.879,that so you
718.88,2.639,you can see that there's you know
720.639,1.44,there's a difference there's a
721.519,2.401,difference
722.079,3.601,so you can also now train an algorithm
723.92,2.8,for instance to pick out features like
725.68,3.2,what is the
726.72,3.44,the distance between the time distance
728.88,3.12,between these uh these
730.16,3.119,peaks and it could also do the same with
732.0,2.8,this and it would be able to do that
733.279,3.12,very precisely
734.8,3.52,and by doing so we may be able to
736.399,3.841,measure for instance that here that
738.32,4.16,there's large variability in between
740.24,4.56,these um the advantage of the algorithm
742.48,4.88,really comes when
744.8,4.159,the for instance you might have somebody
747.36,3.2,who who is say
748.959,3.201,who measures a pattern which looks like
750.56,5.2,this
752.16,6.799,and there might just be one small
755.76,5.6,change perhaps that that occurs
758.959,3.201,very very um maybe not like that but
761.36,4.08,sort of
762.16,4.0,you know some uh more variation that's
765.44,2.88,right in the
766.16,3.04,in the sequence of these um in the
768.32,3.28,timing of these
769.2,3.04,these events um even to a professional
771.6,1.919,eye
772.24,3.2,because they don't have the level of
773.519,4.241,precision they may not be able to
775.44,3.28,detect that this is outside of so the
777.76,3.36,normal range
778.72,3.919,of um a variation but of course an
781.12,4.88,algorithm connected to a
782.639,5.2,high precision sensor um we'll you know
786.0,3.92,we'll be able to determine that
787.839,4.961,difference and in this case
789.92,5.2,this person here may in fact have um a
792.8,6.159,precursor symptom of the disease
795.12,6.08,so this would mean that this person
798.959,3.201,with the help of an algorithm could be
801.2,3.84,diagnosed
802.16,4.32,as having parkinson whereas the doctor
805.04,5.12,himself
806.48,4.64,would miss him out that could for the
810.16,3.04,first time
811.12,3.76,make it possible to detect precursor
813.2,5.28,symptoms of parkinson's
814.88,3.6,and enable early intervention
818.8,4.8,but what else does the data on our
820.56,3.04,smartphones reveal
824.399,6.081,right now you have already apps
827.44,6.16,tracking your so-called activity yeah
830.48,5.84,so in fact the data
833.6,4.16,might be already there well the data
836.32,3.68,potentially could be there
837.76,4.24,that's right but there are ethics about
840.0,4.16,whether we collect that kind of data
842.0,3.44,and use it for for these sorts of
844.16,2.96,purposes
845.44,4.079,you know clearly we can't just collect
847.12,6.0,this data and
849.519,7.281,start diagnosing people which sure
853.12,4.079,we should not no absolutely we could but
856.8,2.159,we
857.199,3.361,we really wouldn't want to there are
858.959,4.801,very good reasons not to do it
860.56,4.48,and uh there may be good reasons for
863.76,3.36,doing it as well
865.04,3.76,but that's the kind of thing that needs
867.12,4.719,that needs to be worked through in a
868.8,4.66,uh in a proper you know regulated
871.839,5.68,setting
873.46,6.619,[Music]
877.519,3.361,after our interview max little tells me
880.079,2.88,he's received
880.88,3.92,several lucrative offers to join tech
882.959,4.481,giants who smell new business
884.8,2.64,opportunities
887.519,2.88,he turned them down
892.56,4.48,artificial intelligence will undoubtedly
894.959,5.201,improve doctors abilities to detect
897.04,5.599,and diagnose disease

943.759,3.601,and there's a lot to indicate it will
945.279,4.401,meet that goal because the government

1007.199,3.44,there's this real hunger in the city and
1008.88,3.44,it's super fun to talk to young people

1019.759,4.241,i thought what do you mean 996. and they
1022.56,4.56,said we work from 9am
1024.0,4.88,to 9pm six days a week
1027.12,4.48,that's the better model now because they
1028.88,4.4,used to just work non-stop
1031.6,3.12,but no one's stopping no one's hitting
1033.28,3.44,the brakes they work like crazy because
1034.72,4.719,they want to bring about change
1036.72,3.44,as a this restaurant cost 20 million
1039.439,4.081,dollars

1043.52,3.919,this huge sum to digitize the entire

1060.0,5.12,which aspects can be implemented in

1103.52,3.2,public safety for instance that the

1106.72,3.92,dramatically increased the crime solving

1110.64,3.52,it's hard for us to relate to because

1133.28,5.759,i'm fascinated by china but it also
1136.4,2.639,puzzles me

1674.559,4.081,how much does google intervene in the eu
1678.88,3.6,i think the more important question is
1680.399,4.481,the one that lies between the lines
1682.48,4.319,namely how ethically does a company deal
1684.88,3.44,with product development

1887.36,4.72,computers and machines one is all of
1889.679,3.201,this mapping and localization all that
1892.08,3.439,technology
1892.88,3.44,works super well computers can know
1895.519,2.4,where they are
1896.32,3.839,within centimeter maybe sometimes with a
1897.919,3.281,millimeter precision way more than what
1900.159,3.36,is required to drive
1901.2,3.199,computers are not able to look around
1903.519,3.52,and understand
1904.399,4.4,where everybody else's but that's not
1907.039,2.961,that's not what's required for driving
1908.799,3.521,what's really required
1910.0,4.159,is to understand what's going to happen
1912.32,3.599,next in the next three seconds
1914.159,3.201,five seconds next minutes maybe even
1915.919,4.401,sometimes next hour
1917.36,4.24,and so that's the key missing piece and
1920.32,4.56,i think the problem there
1921.6,5.76,is that right now it's very hard
1924.88,3.2,for you to describe to me how you
1927.36,2.72,understand
1928.08,3.12,whether or not a person is going to use
1930.08,3.12,the sidewalk
1931.2,3.04,or is going to use the crosswalk and
1933.2,2.8,cross the street
1934.24,3.76,sometimes you look at the face of a
1936.0,2.799,person and that facial impression gives
1938.0,3.76,them away
1938.799,4.161,and you will slow down sometimes not
1941.76,1.84,they may be looking at the same
1942.96,2.4,direction
1943.6,3.919,they may be standing in the same
1945.36,2.88,location it's just a little face
1947.519,2.64,impression
1948.24,3.2,maybe just the way they stand and
1950.159,4.561,unfortunately that kind of
1951.44,5.52,intuition gut feeling and so on is
1954.72,3.15,very hard for us to program into the
1956.96,2.559,computers
1957.87,4.049,[Music]
1959.519,4.481,it works in a simple lab environment but
1961.919,4.24,in real life settings the algorithms are
1964.0,13.84,still totally out of their depth
1966.159,11.681,not that that bothers advertisers
1979.279,5.041,our test drives were nothing but a
1981.2,3.12,series of glitches
1989.2,7.04,an inexplicable emergency stop
1992.32,3.92,and another one on the second attempt
2000.24,6.48,the sensors on this vehicle were over
2002.159,4.561,taxed by a car parked on the curb
2010.08,9.04,and here this smart car overlooked a car
2012.64,10.32,veering into our lane
2019.12,4.72,well that didn't work talking to the mit
2022.96,2.559,engineers
2023.84,3.12,it becomes clear that to build a
2025.519,3.601,self-driving car
2026.96,5.52,developers need to meet a massive scale
2029.12,5.12,of technical requirements
2032.48,3.6,what i think about fully autonomous cars
2034.24,2.88,is that i think i would be very
2036.08,3.599,surprised
2037.12,4.08,if it happens in less than 10 years also
2039.679,3.201,i will be very surprised i'm a big
2041.2,3.44,believer i'd be very surprised if it
2042.88,3.679,doesn't happen in 20 30 years
2044.64,3.519,i think it will happen at some point but
2046.559,3.84,i do think that people really
2048.159,4.0,underestimate the kind of technology
2050.399,3.76,required to be built
2052.159,4.081,to make your car fully autonomous under
2054.159,3.041,every condition every circumstance every
2056.24,4.459,whatsoever
2057.2,5.93,that's the very hard part
2060.699,4.98,[Music]
2063.13,5.269,[Applause]
2065.679,5.041,ultra fun driving is not as trivial a
2068.399,3.841,process as you might think
2070.72,5.119,and that's because you constantly have
2072.24,3.599,to watch what's going on around you
2076.56,4.24,cyclists pedestrians sometimes you have
2079.2,3.36,to second guess
2080.8,4.48,does this guy want to cross the road or
2082.56,7.279,not it's hard to imagine all that being
2085.28,4.559,calculated automatically
2092.29,3.99,[Music]
2101.99,3.16,[Music]
2105.44,4.0,a self-driving vehicle would have to be
2107.2,4.159,able to deal with all of this too
2109.44,4.159,here we have a truck doing a three-point
2111.359,2.24,turn
2113.68,3.18,i may have to back up now if he doesn't
2115.2,5.429,make it
2116.86,3.769,[Music]
2128.56,4.18,does she want to cross the road or not
2130.56,5.32,some people don't even wait
2132.74,3.14,[Music]
2138.24,4.8,the fully autonomous car is a distant
2140.4,3.6,dream but driver assistance systems are
2143.04,3.92,already making our
2144.0,2.96,roads safer
2155.2,5.2,an accident filmed from a car equipped
2157.52,4.88,with emergency brake assist
2160.4,4.0,the sequence of events can be assessed
2162.4,4.0,in slow motion
2164.4,3.84,the red vehicle ahead overlooks the
2166.4,4.8,upcoming traffic jam
2168.24,3.76,no brake lights appear but the distance
2171.2,3.2,sensor in this
2172.0,4.72,car registers the jam breaks and
2174.4,4.16,prevents a further collision
2176.72,3.84,but which principles should guide
2178.56,4.64,decisions made by technology in an
2180.56,5.2,accident situation
2183.2,4.56,in recent years mit's media lab has been
2185.76,5.44,addressing the ethical questions raised
2187.76,3.44,by artificial intelligence
2192.72,9.119,what moral compass should future smart
2194.88,6.959,devices refer to
2203.53,3.91,[Music]
2205.44,3.52,is one of the world's leading experts on
2207.44,3.36,such issues
2208.96,3.68,he and his team developed a survey
2210.8,3.44,called the moral machine to explore
2212.64,2.56,ethics for programming autonomous
2214.24,4.56,vehicles
2215.2,3.6,like in the event of an accident
2219.44,3.28,most of the time people don't remember
2221.92,3.12,anything
2222.72,4.08,and people have no time to react
2225.04,4.96,everything happens very quickly
2226.8,4.88,so they just are surprised
2230.0,3.2,maybe they see something in front of
2231.68,4.159,them and they just swerve in
2233.2,4.0,some random direction or maybe they just
2235.839,4.961,freak out and
2237.2,6.639,press the brakes so you cannot expect a
2240.8,5.36,human being to do the right thing
2243.839,4.161,in that small exactly in that in such a
2246.16,4.16,small time scale unless you know they
2248.0,3.44,they made a decision beforehand like you
2250.32,3.68,know did they
2251.44,4.32,drink and drive or did they know that
2254.0,4.079,they were going to cross a red light
2255.76,3.839,then you blame them but otherwise you
2258.079,3.76,can't really blame the human
2259.599,3.041,but with a machine because of the speed
2261.839,2.641,of the
2262.64,4.16,electronics because the autonomous car
2264.48,5.84,is evaluating the environment
2266.8,5.44,you know millions of times per second
2270.32,3.519,then time goes much slower for the
2272.24,4.16,machine and it's able to
2273.839,4.321,recalculate the situation and maybe
2276.4,4.959,recalculate the strategy
2278.16,5.679,and this is where we can make
2281.359,3.76,a potentially better judgment than the
2283.839,3.28,whatever random
2285.119,3.041,choice the human used to make in this
2287.119,3.201,situation
2288.16,3.76,now what is better though is a very
2290.32,3.6,interesting question and it's not
2291.92,4.56,obvious and let's see a case where we
2293.92,5.28,have people versus people so now we have
2296.48,3.04,um the vehicle has two people inside of
2299.2,3.68,it
2299.52,6.319,okay and um it's going to either
2302.88,4.8,swerve and hit the barrier so the people
2305.839,4.161,will die in the car
2307.68,4.48,or the car will go straight and kill the
2310.0,3.68,pedestrians the pedestrians
2312.16,3.36,who are crossing illegally but they're
2313.68,4.159,also women and
2315.52,3.92,and these uh the people in the car are
2317.839,3.52,males so now
2319.44,4.32,it gets very complicated very quickly
2321.359,3.921,should you prioritize women over men or
2323.76,3.68,should everybody be the same
2325.28,3.839,should you prioritize pedestrian over
2327.44,3.28,passenger or not
2329.119,3.361,should you take into account the fact
2330.72,4.96,that people are
2332.48,3.84,crossing illegally in this case so as
2335.68,2.88,you can see
2336.32,3.039,once you have multiple dimensions it
2338.56,3.2,becomes
2339.359,4.24,not obvious what the right thing to do
2341.76,5.28,is
2343.599,7.121,a or b who should die
2347.04,6.4,the elderly lady crossing on red
2350.72,3.52,or the child in the self-driving car
2353.44,3.52,what choice
2354.24,4.64,should the algorithm make ead's online
2356.96,3.76,survey presents respondents with various
2358.88,2.56,scenarios each with its own unique
2360.72,2.96,dilemma
2361.44,4.8,respondents are then asked to choose how
2363.68,4.88,they would want an algorithm to decide
2366.24,3.52,so as a result we have 40 million
2368.56,3.44,decisions
2369.76,3.599,and they're still counting from people
2372.0,4.32,all over the world
2373.359,4.321,and it enables us to start analyzing
2376.32,7.519,what do people agree on
2377.68,6.159,but also how do they differ
2384.79,4.97,[Music]
2387.44,4.32,so does our culture influence our moral
2389.76,5.76,judgments
2391.76,6.48,people always agree on saving more lives
2395.52,3.52,saving children saving people who cross
2398.24,3.2,legally
2399.04,3.039,over people who don't cross legally and
2401.44,2.24,so on
2402.079,3.201,the most interesting part is you could
2403.68,4.639,pick a country
2405.28,4.72,like germany yes and you could see how
2408.319,2.241,they compared to the global average you
2410.0,3.359,could see
2410.56,4.08,ah okay so the status is not really
2413.359,4.401,important but what you can see
2414.64,4.4,in germany is preferring in action yeah
2417.76,4.16,so if you don't have to
2419.04,3.84,if you prefer to just go straight yes
2421.92,3.439,which is the default
2422.88,4.32,don't take a decision exactly this means
2425.359,4.081,germans don't like to take a decision
2427.2,2.24,yes
2433.359,5.281,germans don't like other people
2436.48,3.599,you say close your eyes and and go and
2438.64,4.0,just go so so
2440.079,4.0,this means in other words you can see a
2442.64,4.88,bit the acceptance
2444.079,8.401,of technology taking a decision
2447.52,4.96,and the more you say inaction means
2455.359,4.24,a comparison of germany and france
2457.44,5.04,reveals cultural differences
2459.599,8.24,the french tend to favor sparing women
2462.48,5.359,and there's a stronger focus on children
2468.88,4.16,and contrary to germans the french don't
2471.28,3.36,want to leave things to fate
2473.04,4.0,they want the machine to make the
2474.64,2.4,decision
2478.319,3.601,the machine is kind of a mirror for the
2480.88,4.479,first time
2481.92,6.08,something that you did subconsciously or
2485.359,4.161,maybe instinctively in the case of an
2488.0,3.68,accident you know you just
2489.52,3.44,act randomly now you have to make a
2491.68,4.159,conscious choice
2492.96,3.359,and the machine is forcing you to make a
2495.839,3.041,choice
2496.319,4.081,right you cannot you cannot hand wave it
2498.88,3.199,because in the end you have to program
2500.4,3.76,something
2502.079,4.081,driverless cars aren't yet ready for the
2504.16,5.28,road and ethical questions
2506.16,4.88,still abound artificial intelligence
2509.44,3.679,harbors immense potential
2511.04,3.12,to benefit daily life medicine or
2513.119,2.801,mobility
2514.16,3.6,but we also need to look beyond the
2515.92,4.72,technical possibilities
2517.76,3.359,what aim does such progress serve it's a
2520.64,2.8,question
2521.119,3.281,artificial intelligence algorithms can't
2523.44,14.1,answer
2524.4,16.21,only humankind can do that
2537.54,3.07,[Music]
2545.76,2.079,you
