0.0,4.62,what is human computer interaction and
2.76,4.019,honestly it's a great question because
4.62,5.1,just the name human computer interaction
6.779,4.981,is kind of weird and very vague and
9.72,3.9,actually the degree in general is pretty
11.76,4.5,vague so what is a human computer
13.62,4.739,interaction degree and is it worth it
16.26,4.38,and do the costs outweigh the value my
18.359,4.441,name is Sasha C I'm actually a ux
20.64,4.5,designer so I am actually currently in
22.8,4.44,the field getting a masters at DePaul
25.14,3.899,University in human computer interaction
27.24,4.199,and I want to tell you guys a little bit
29.039,4.561,about what exactly it is what to expect
31.439,4.501,and if it's actually worth it so people
33.6,4.979,are fascinated including myself by the
35.94,4.5,connection of computers and people now
38.579,3.841,there are several different fields of
40.44,4.56,study that are growing dedicated to
42.42,4.92,algorithms and studies and research just
45.0,5.16,based on ways on how technology can help
47.34,4.5,improve people's everyday lives so what
50.16,3.66,exactly is human computer interaction
51.84,3.6,what do these weird words even mean so
53.82,3.36,I'm actually just going to read a
55.44,3.72,complete definition and then just kind
57.18,4.68,of give my own definition so human
59.16,6.02,computer action is an area of study that
61.86,3.32,involves better understanding
68.88,4.739,so now
70.38,5.099,muskription of what HCI is so HCI is a
73.619,4.561,really broad term and it's really just
75.479,4.32,the development and research of ways you
78.18,3.299,can improve people's lives through
79.799,3.421,technology that's the best way that I
81.479,2.881,can really describe it you have to like
83.22,3.06,kind of understand that you're
84.36,4.68,incorporating so many different things
86.28,4.56,you're considering the user the business
89.04,3.6,behind whatever you're making so you
90.84,3.0,have to understand what the goal is for
92.64,3.479,whatever you're making are you trying to
93.84,3.84,make money are you trying to educate are
96.119,2.941,you trying to entertain and then you
97.68,3.42,also have to work with what's actually
99.06,3.599,functionally possible such as like
101.1,3.3,developers if you're like putting
102.659,3.361,together this prototype and you give it
104.4,4.14,to a developer and they're like yo I
106.02,5.52,can't do this it won't work there are so
108.54,5.1,many different jobs in that field it is
111.54,4.38,kind of crazy so specifically just for
113.64,5.519,example I'm a ux designer this is really
115.92,5.879,just the idea that I design systems that
119.159,4.561,improve either businesses or people's
121.799,3.301,lives every single day so personally a
123.72,3.359,lot of the clients that I work with are
125.1,3.18,actually business related so a lot of
127.079,2.82,the things that I'm working on are
128.28,3.92,technologies that can help improve
129.899,5.581,business functions and business value
132.2,6.1,there are research scientists where
135.48,5.04,literally like apple or Microsoft will
138.3,4.74,hire you to literally just do simple
140.52,4.38,research on the process of how people
143.04,3.72,are using their technology and then
144.9,5.04,there are product designers they really
146.76,5.94,focus on more visuals I'd say they focus
149.94,5.58,on like UI elements how people visually
152.7,4.38,interact with interfaces online and that
155.52,3.9,goes into another role which you can do
157.08,4.5,which is UI design which is literally
159.42,3.959,just developing user interfaces and a
161.58,3.659,user interface is pretty much just
163.379,4.021,anything that a user can interact with
165.239,5.401,so think of your iPhone screen that's a
167.4,5.419,user interface or a website that is also
170.64,5.04,a user interface there are information
172.819,5.081,Architects and this is pretty much just
175.68,4.74,the research of how people are
177.9,5.28,processing information when going
180.42,4.74,through a design process and I actually
183.18,3.559,think this one can go past just
185.16,4.56,technology I've seen information
186.739,5.681,Architects work on things such as like
189.72,4.439,Hospital systems where physical patients
192.42,3.3,are actually going through a system and
194.159,3.841,they're really researching the process
195.72,4.5,that each patient is going through and
198.0,4.14,developing a better system for it and
200.22,4.379,just to list off a couple more things
202.14,6.179,you can be a tech startup a computer
204.599,5.881,programmer a systems engineer really a
208.319,4.56,lot of front-end development and front
210.48,4.5,end really means like the visuals and
212.879,4.021,what the user is seeing so getting back
214.98,4.02,into the major a little bit and why
216.9,4.38,exactly you would want to study human
219.0,4.019,computer interaction other than just
221.28,4.2,getting these jobs if you're interested
223.019,4.261,in any of these things I'd probably say
225.48,3.479,that yeah you should probably look into
227.28,4.56,it and see if it's a right career path
228.959,5.521,for you if you are interested in solving
231.84,4.56,super complex problems you love working
234.48,4.44,with other people pretty much all day
236.4,4.5,you enjoy working with computers you
238.92,4.14,have a base understanding of how a
240.9,4.5,computer works and you're looking for a
243.06,4.38,challenging yet fulfilling job which
245.4,4.38,honestly pays pretty well that's that's
247.44,4.74,another good side note and if you really
249.78,4.019,want to make impact on people's lives
252.18,3.6,through technology then this is the
253.799,3.601,right major for you so just to list off
255.78,4.139,some of the classes that I've taken so
257.4,4.98,far at DePaul University studying HCI
259.919,5.34,I've completed user research methods
262.38,5.539,statistics and data analysis website
265.259,6.061,design scripting for interactive systems
267.919,6.161,HCI fundamentals Global user research
271.32,5.159,learned Center design Behavioral Science
274.08,4.08,and user experience those are literally
276.479,3.181,just a few classes that I've taken so
278.16,2.94,far but that kind of gives you a little
279.66,2.94,bit of an idea of the classes that you
281.1,4.5,will be taking so the reason you guys
282.6,4.68,are here is it worth it getting a HDI
285.6,4.62,master's degree
287.28,4.56,I would say yes however I think this
290.22,3.9,goes person to person you should always
291.84,3.66,be outweighing your costs how much it is
294.12,3.84,to go to whatever school that you
295.5,4.199,applied to and if the value really
297.96,3.9,outweighs how much you're paying and
299.699,4.141,fortunately when it comes to HCI I think
301.86,4.92,the knowledge and honestly just project
303.84,5.04,earnings that you get when in school far
306.78,4.8,outweigh the cost that you pay this is
308.88,4.56,just me but that's my opinion now since
311.58,3.48,I'm actually working in the industry at
313.44,3.78,the same time getting my Master's Degree
315.06,4.139,you may be asking why are you doing that
317.22,3.72,and honestly it's just because I love
319.199,3.361,learning about the topic and I think
320.94,3.539,getting a master's degree in it just
322.56,3.72,proves that I'm really passionate about
324.479,4.44,it it shows employers that I'm really
326.28,4.259,wanting to do this for a living and it's
328.919,3.12,something that really excites me it's
330.539,3.301,also worth noting that you get paid more
332.039,3.961,when you have a master's degree in it so
333.84,4.139,yes in the end I do think it is worth it
336.0,3.84,getting the degree I think you'll enjoy
337.979,4.021,the studies a lot and you will be
339.84,5.28,challenged a lot a lot of this is a lot
342.0,6.36,of theory and idea seeking understanding
345.12,5.46,statistics and data analysis that is all
348.36,4.08,really critical when doing user research
350.58,3.42,and honestly some of it cannot be very
352.44,3.78,fun like I said there are so many
354.0,5.1,careers that you can really go down and
356.22,4.56,that alone I think is worth the HCI
359.1,3.12,component so one thing that I also want
360.78,4.139,to know because people ask me all the
362.22,5.4,time is will you have to code in this
364.919,4.681,degree and yes you will only for a
367.62,4.38,little bit though my introductory
369.6,3.78,classes were a lot of coding usually a
372.0,3.66,lot of front-end coding I didn't really
373.38,4.98,do a lot of like back end but you will
375.66,4.44,have to learn like JavaScript HTML CSS
378.36,4.32,just the basics you're not going to be
380.1,5.219,like developing a super complex app but
382.68,4.38,you will be making interfaces and making
385.319,3.421,things that people can interact with
387.06,3.9,you'd be surprised how quickly you can
388.74,3.84,catch on and finally before I end the
390.96,3.48,video obviously you have to gain
392.58,3.839,experience you're not going to get these
394.44,4.259,jobs like that just by having a degree
396.419,4.321,you do have to work a little bit find
398.699,3.661,some clients maybe yourself and get some
400.74,4.44,knowledge in the actual field because
402.36,4.92,there are so many skills that the degree
405.18,3.78,may not teach you such as like inner
407.28,3.9,personal skills that you'll have to do
408.96,3.42,literally just in business so I hope
411.18,2.94,that gave you guys a little bit of an
412.38,4.68,idea of what human computer interaction
414.12,4.68,is because it is a very odd name for a
417.06,3.54,degree however I cannot recommend the
418.8,3.3,degree enough I've learned so much and
420.6,2.879,I've had so much fun learning everything
422.1,3.24,in it if you guys want to know anything
423.479,3.961,else or have any questions feel free to
425.34,3.9,comment in the comment section give this
427.44,3.599,video a like give me a subscribe I'm
429.24,3.36,uploading every single week so I hope to
431.039,4.041,catch you guys in the next one I'm out
432.6,2.48,peace
