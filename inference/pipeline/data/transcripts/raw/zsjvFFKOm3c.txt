0.32,5.28,structured query language sql or sql for
3.439,4.081,short is the gold standard language for
5.6,3.68,communicating with relational database
7.52,3.76,management systems you've likely heard
9.28,4.96,of databases like mysql
11.28,4.88,postgres microsoft sql server and oracle
14.24,3.119,all of which are based on sql with their
16.16,2.879,own little variations
17.359,4.241,it was initially developed in the early
19.039,5.761,70s to mutate and retrieve data from
21.6,5.36,ibm's system r database by 1986
24.8,4.08,it was standardized into the syntax that
26.96,4.159,remains extremely popular in technical
28.88,4.24,applications today a relational database
31.119,3.841,organizes data into tables
33.12,3.84,kind of like an excel spreadsheet where
34.96,2.48,columns contain attributes or types of
36.96,2.48,data
37.44,4.16,while each row represents an individual
39.44,2.56,record or data point with its own unique
41.6,2.72,id
42.0,4.239,known as a primary key we can establish
44.32,4.079,relationships between data points
46.239,3.921,by taking the unique id from one row and
48.399,2.561,storing it on a different row in a
50.16,2.96,different table
50.96,4.239,in a special column known as a foreign
53.12,4.079,key in the teams table the team id
55.199,3.601,is the primary key but in the players
57.199,3.52,table it's the foreign key
58.8,4.16,and what that data structure tells us is
60.719,4.72,that a player belongs to one team
62.96,3.199,while a team can have many players what
65.439,2.801,we've done here
66.159,4.401,is structured our data in its smallest
68.24,3.28,normal form to eliminate duplication and
70.56,4.0,redundancy
71.52,3.599,now the role of sql is not only to read
74.56,3.199,create
75.119,3.601,update and delete data but also to join
77.759,2.561,data together
78.72,3.039,based on the relationships embedded
80.32,3.92,within it the syntax
81.759,3.521,is comprised of several key parts if we
84.24,3.199,zoom all the way out
85.28,3.12,we have a statement or a piece of code
87.439,2.961,that does something
88.4,3.92,like reads or writes to the database
90.4,3.52,within a statement we have a variety of
92.32,2.32,keywords that can manipulate the
93.92,2.96,database
94.64,3.519,select can be used to make a query for
96.88,4.16,the columns that you want
98.159,3.681,from a table the column and table names
101.04,2.88,are known as
101.84,3.599,identifiers but we may not want every
103.92,3.36,row in the table so we filter the
105.439,3.36,results with the where keyword to only
107.28,2.159,include records that meet a certain
108.799,2.32,condition
109.439,3.281,it's like looping over every row in the
111.119,3.441,table and only returning rows in the
112.72,2.399,query where the predicate evaluates to
114.56,2.559,true
115.119,3.6,then we might use the join keyword to
117.119,2.241,connect data from an entirely different
118.719,2.4,table
119.36,3.68,by matching the primary key on this
121.119,2.481,table to the foreign key on another
123.04,2.399,table
123.6,3.36,what we've created is a collection of
125.439,3.841,clauses that make up
126.96,3.84,a full sql statement we can now go and
129.28,3.12,execute this code on the hundreds of
130.8,3.6,different databases that support
132.4,3.6,sql this has been structured query
134.4,3.28,language in 100 seconds
136.0,3.04,like and subscribe if you want to see a
137.68,3.199,full sql tutorial
139.04,4.8,thanks for watching and i will see you
