0.0,4.5,let's talk about how to choose a
2.1,4.38,database in a system design interview
4.5,4.5,in these interviews you will often have
6.48,5.039,to choose what database to use and these
9.0,4.2,databases are split into SQL and nosql
11.519,3.421,types and they each have their own
13.2,3.419,strengths and weaknesses and should be
14.94,3.919,chosen appropriately based on the use
16.619,2.24,case
20.34,5.699,first let's define both SQL and nosql
23.22,6.059,databases SQL stands for structured
26.039,6.661,query language SQL databases are table
29.279,6.12,based while nosql are document key value
32.7,4.74,graph or wide column stores SQL
35.399,4.021,databases are vertically scalable while
37.44,4.68,nosql databases are horizontally
39.42,6.78,scalable let's start with the strengths
42.12,6.24,of SQL databases first SQL databases are
46.2,3.72,relational databases which means that
48.36,3.719,they allow easy querying on
49.92,4.979,relationships between data among
52.079,4.32,multiple tables table relationships are
54.899,3.541,really important for effectively
56.399,4.621,organizing and structuring a lot of
58.44,4.32,different data second the data is well
61.02,3.9,structured and the room for potential
62.76,4.2,error is therefore reduced this is
64.92,3.9,because SQL schemas require the data
66.96,4.86,model and format of the data to be known
68.82,5.82,before storing anything third SQL
71.82,5.58,databases are acid compliant this means
74.64,5.1,that transactions are Atomic consistent
77.4,4.38,isolated and durable
79.74,4.019,SQL transactions are groups of
81.78,4.019,statements that are executed atomically
83.759,5.04,this means that they are either all
85.799,5.281,executed or not executed at all if any
88.799,5.041,statement in the group fails with all
91.08,4.079,these strengths SQL sounds great so what
93.84,3.9,are its weaknesses
95.159,4.801,well first structured data might mean
97.74,4.08,fewer errors but it also means that
99.96,4.86,columns and tables have to be created
101.82,4.86,ahead of time so SQL databases take more
104.82,4.2,time to set up compared to nosql
106.68,4.68,databases they're also not effective for
109.02,4.139,storing and querying unstructured data
111.36,4.98,where the format is unknown
113.159,4.92,second SQL databases are difficult to
116.34,4.38,scale horizontally because of their
118.079,4.201,relational nature for read heavy systems
120.72,3.84,it's straightforward to provision
122.28,4.74,multiple read-only replicas but for
124.56,4.199,write heavy systems usually the only
127.02,4.079,option is to vertically scale the
128.759,3.961,database up which is generally more
131.099,4.081,expensive than provisioning additional
132.72,6.3,servers now let's talk about the
135.18,6.54,benefits of nosql databases first nosql
139.02,4.38,databases are more flexible and simpler
141.72,4.08,to set up because they do not support
143.4,4.74,table relationships and data is usually
145.8,4.38,stored in documents or as key value
148.14,4.8,pairs they're a better choice for
150.18,4.919,storing unstructured data second because
152.94,4.26,they're better at handling unstructured
155.099,3.961,data they can also Shard this data
157.2,4.319,across different data stores allowing
159.06,5.7,for distributed databases this makes
161.519,4.8,horizontal scaling much easier and very
164.76,3.36,large amounts of data can be stored
166.319,5.041,without having to purchase a single
168.12,6.72,expensive server but nosql databases
171.36,5.22,also have their weaknesses first nosql
174.84,4.56,databases are typically designed for
176.58,4.5,distributed use cases and write heavy
179.4,3.66,systems can be supported by having
181.08,3.84,multiple right shards for the same data
183.06,5.16,partition this is called peer-to-peer
184.92,5.64,replication however the trade-off is a
188.22,4.439,loss of strong consistency after a right
190.56,4.259,to a shard in a distributed nosql
192.659,3.901,cluster there's a small delay before
194.819,4.5,that update can be propagated to other
196.56,4.74,replicas during this time reading from a
199.319,4.2,replica can result in accessing stale
201.3,3.96,data this weakness of the data
203.519,4.381,eventually being up to date is called
205.26,4.979,eventual consistency eventual
207.9,5.4,consistency isn't exactly a fault of
210.239,5.401,just nosql databases but of distributed
213.3,4.5,databases in general A Single Shard
215.64,4.2,nosql database can be strongly
217.8,4.68,consistent but to fully take advantage
219.84,4.619,of the scalability benefits of nosql the
222.48,3.72,database should really be set up as a
224.459,3.84,distributed cluster and that's it for
