hello everyone
and welcome back to the course of dbms
in this video we will be looking into
the fundamentals
of database systems now let's go through
the outlines of this video
first we will be discussing about what a
data model is and also its categories
the first category of data model is the
high level or conceptual data model
then we have the representational or
implementation
data models and finally low level or
physical data models
and then we will be looking at few
terminologies that we need to
familiarize with
so moving on first let us see what a
data model is
and why we require it one of the most
important characteristics of database
approach is that
it provides data abstraction now what is
data abstraction
it is the hiding of complex details or
details that are not
needed by the database users now to
achieve this data abstraction we have
something called as
data model data model is a collection of
concepts
used to describe the structure of the
database like specifying the data types
constraints etc most data models
include a set of basic operations to
manipulate the data in the database
like retrieval of data from the database
or updates
on the data in the database in addition
to these basic operations
data model also includes concepts to
specify the behavior
of a database application and so it
allows the database designer to specify
a set of valid user defined operations
so this is an introduction to data
models and why we require it that is to
achieve
data abstraction now we can categorize
these data models
based on the types of concepts they use
to describe the structure of a
database the first category high level
or conceptual data model
provides concepts to present data in a
way
or that are close to the way many users
see
or perceive data the conceptual data
model
uses concepts such as entities
attributes
and relationships entities represent
real-world object or concept like for
example
employee student etc these are all
entities as they represent real-world
object
next attributes they further describe an
entity like the student name role number
etc and then we have relationships which
is an association or a link
among two or more entities like for
example
an employee works on many projects so a
relationship
exists between the employee and each
project
so this is about the first category of
data model the high level or the
conceptual data model
the next category is the low level or
the physical data model
this model provides concepts that
describe how data is stored in the
computer
by representing information like the
format
the access path etc an access
path is a structure that makes search
for a particular database record
efficient or in other words i can say
access path is a structure
for efficient searching of a particular
database record
this is the second category the low
level or the physical data model
the next category of data model is
representational or
implementation data model there are
three data models that come
under this category the first is a
relational data model
then we have the network data model and
the hierarchical model
and representational data models
represent data
using record structures and that is why
representational data models
are sometimes called record-based data
models
so these are the categories of data
models
next is the terminologies that we need
to familiarize ourselves with
the first one is database schema
database schema
is a description of a database in our
first video we have seen that metadata
is also a description of a database
now what is the difference between a
metadata and a schema
metadata is data about data or in other
words
it describes the data in the database
whereas schema
is just a plan or a layout or a
blueprint of the database
a schema is a subset of metadata or it
is one of the components of metadata
and a diagrammatic representation of
schema is called a schema diagram or in
other words
it is the displayed schema and this is
how a schema diagram would look like
and each object within the schema is
called
a schema construct like for example the
tables in the database
student course etc these are called as
schema construct a schema isn't supposed
to change
frequently but suppose if we want to add
a new data item say the date of birth to
the student schema
then that is called as schema evolution
but the data in the database can change
frequently and
so the data in the database at a
particular moment
in time or at a particular instant is
called as
a database state or an instance or
snapshot when we define a new database
the database state is empty because it
has no
data when the database is populated or
filled with the initial data
that's when we have the initial database
state
from then on once we start updating the
database we get different database state
so at
any point in time the data in the
database is the current
state of the database so these are few
other terminologies that we need to know
with this we come to the end of this
video hope you all have understood the
fundamental concepts of database systems
which includes
the data model its categories and few
terminologies
thank you
