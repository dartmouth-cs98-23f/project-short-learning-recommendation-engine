6.871,3.167,"In many ways, 
our memories make us who we are,"
10.038,2.0,"helping us remember our past,"
12.038,1.958,"learn and retain skills,"
13.996,2.292,and plan for the future.
16.288,3.625,"And for the computers that often act
as extensions of ourselves,"
19.913,2.208,"memory plays much the same role,"
22.121,1.583,"whether it's a two-hour movie,"
23.704,1.584,"a two-word text file,"
25.288,2.541,"or the instructions for opening either,"
27.829,5.542,"everything in a computer's memory
takes the form of basic units called bits,"
33.371,2.458,or binary digits.
35.829,2.542,Each of these is stored in a memory cell
38.371,3.791,"that can switch between two states
for two possible values,"
42.162,1.875,0 and 1.
44.037,3.125,"Files and programs consist of millions
of these bits,"
47.162,3.25,"all processed in 
the central processing unit,"
50.412,1.334,"or CPU,"
51.746,2.333,that acts as the computer's brain.
54.079,4.583,"And as the number of bits needing
to be processed grows exponentially,"
58.662,2.875,"computer designers face 
a constant struggle"
61.537,3.751,"between size, cost, and speed."
65.288,4.833,"Like us, computers have short-term memory
for immediate tasks,"
70.121,3.292,"and long-term memory 
for more permanent storage."
73.413,1.875,"When you run a program,"
75.288,3.666,"your operating system allocates area
within the short-term memory"
78.954,1.875,for performing those instructions.
80.829,3.542,"For example, when you press a key
in a word processor,"
84.371,5.167,"the CPU will access one of these locations
to retrieve bits of data."
89.538,4.333,"It could also modify them,
or create new ones."
93.871,4.375,"The time this takes is known 
as the memory's latency."
98.246,5.542,"And because program instructions must be
processed quickly and continuously,"
103.788,4.791,"all locations within the short-term memory
can be accessed in any order,"
108.579,3.125,hence the name random access memory.
111.704,4.209,"The most common type of RAM 
is dynamic RAM, or DRAM."
115.913,5.083,"There, each memory cell consists
of a tiny transistor and a capacitor"
120.996,2.0,"that store electrical charges,"
122.996,4.542,"a 0 when there's no charge,
or a 1 when charged."
127.538,1.625,Such memory is called dynamic
129.163,4.208,"because it only holds charges briefly
before they leak away,"
133.371,3.375,"requiring periodic recharging
to retain data."
136.746,3.25,"But even its low latency 
of 100 nanoseconds"
139.996,2.667,"is too long for modern CPUs,"
142.663,3.916,"so there's also a small, 
high-speed internal memory cache"
146.579,1.917,made from static RAM.
148.496,3.208,"That's usually made up 
of six interlocked transistors"
151.704,1.917,which don't need refreshing.
153.621,3.167,"SRAM is the fastest memory 
in a computer system,"
156.788,1.875,"but also the most expensive,"
158.663,3.75,"and takes up three times 
more space than DRAM."
162.413,4.166,"But RAM and cache can only hold data
as long as they're powered."
166.579,3.042,"For data to remain
once the device is turned off,"
169.621,3.375,"it must be transferred 
into a long-term storage device,"
172.996,2.292,which comes in three major types.
175.288,2.458,"In magnetic storage, 
which is the cheapest,"
177.746,5.792,"data is stored as a magnetic pattern on
a spinning disc coated with magnetic film."
183.538,3.666,"But because the disc must rotate 
to where the data is located"
187.204,1.417,"in order to be read,"
188.621,5.875,"the latency for such drives is 100,000 
times slower than that of DRAM."
194.496,4.125,"On the other hand, optical-based storage
like DVD and Blu-ray"
198.621,2.0,"also uses spinning discs,"
200.621,2.208,but with a reflective coating.
202.829,5.209,"Bits are encoded as light and dark spots
using a dye that can be read by a laser."
208.038,3.125,"While optical storage media are cheap
and removable,"
211.163,3.708,"they have even slower latencies 
than magnetic storage"
214.871,2.375,and lower capacity as well.
217.246,5.625,"Finally, the newest and fastest types of
long-term storage are solid-state drives,"
222.871,1.167,like flash sticks.
224.038,1.916,"These have no moving parts,"
225.954,2.667,instead using floating gate transistors
228.621,4.5,"that store bits by trapping 
or removing electrical charges"
233.121,3.333,"within their specially designed 
internal structures."
236.454,3.292,"So how reliable 
are these billions of bits?"
239.746,3.708,"We tend to think of computer memory
as stable and permanent,"
243.454,2.917,but it actually degrades fairly quickly.
246.371,2.625,"The heat generated from a device
and its environment"
248.996,2.75,"will eventually demagnetize hard drives,"
251.746,2.25,"degrade the dye in optical media,"
253.996,3.125,"and cause charge leakage 
in floating gates."
257.121,2.958,"Solid-state drives 
also have an additional weakness."
260.079,4.0,"Repeatedly writing to floating gate 
transistors corrodes them,"
264.079,2.625,eventually rendering them useless.
266.704,2.5,With data on most current storage media
269.204,2.75,"having less than 
a ten-year life expectancy,"
271.954,4.375,"scientists are working to exploit
the physical properties of materials"
276.329,2.334,down to the quantum level
278.663,2.333,"in the hopes of making 
memory devices faster,"
280.996,1.083,"smaller,"
282.079,1.542,and more durable.
283.621,5.417,"For now, immortality remains out of reach,
for humans and computers alike."
