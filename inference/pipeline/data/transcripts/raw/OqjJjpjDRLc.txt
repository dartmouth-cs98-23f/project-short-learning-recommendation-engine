0.06,1.979,I've got a pop quiz for you.
2.04,2.189,What database system has been around
4.23,3.149,for almost 50 years?
7.38,1.559,I guess you can guessed it by the
8.94,1.559,topic of this video.
10.5,2.369,It's a relational database.
12.87,1.0,"Hello, my name is Jamil Spain,"
14.97,1.919,Developer Advocate with the IBM
16.89,1.649,Cloud and Brand Technical
18.54,1.559,Specialists in the U.S.
20.1,1.979,Financial Services market.
22.08,1.589,"And today's talk, we're going to"
23.67,2.249,dive a little bit into relational
25.92,0.869,databases.
26.79,0.989,I'm going to get into some of the
27.78,2.189,characteristics of the database
29.97,2.129,model and also some benefits
32.1,2.159,that it provides for you when making
34.26,1.739,your decision that you want to use
36.0,2.249,this for your next project
38.25,0.959,to get started.
39.21,1.889,Let's talk about the structure
41.1,1.889,of a relational database
42.99,1.049,system.
44.04,2.159,It's going to pretty much map
46.2,2.279,out your data points
48.48,1.889,and bring out the relationships
50.37,1.379,in that. And the way that it
51.75,1.769,accomplishes that is through.
53.52,2.039,"The first thing is making tables,"
55.56,2.369,which represents particular
57.93,1.979,items or nouns or particular
59.91,1.829,entities of your particular
61.74,1.769,system that you want to actually
63.51,1.829,prototype. So let's say I
65.34,1.02,have a bunch of books.
69.33,2.219,Now this is going to be a table.
71.55,2.129,It accomplishes the attributes
73.68,2.969,of these books by having columns
76.65,1.529,and columns will be things like
78.18,1.0,name.
81.52,1.0,Date.
83.85,1.2,"OK, maybe author."
86.63,1.349,"Of course, got to have a author for"
87.98,1.56,a book and every.
90.61,2.159,"Table is going to have an ID, feel"
92.77,2.129,some way to uniquely identify
94.9,2.309,it. Each each row
97.21,1.0,of this.
99.37,1.919,Database table represents an
101.29,1.839,"actual record or an item,"
103.13,1.159,a type of book.
104.29,2.399,That's how it really fulfills
106.69,1.979,that ability to hold the database
108.67,1.0,system there.
111.76,1.919,"And then as you wait, you"
113.68,2.279,kind of query out this particular
115.96,3.029,system is through what we call a
118.99,2.219,you will a structured query
121.21,1.409,language.
122.62,1.379,"And it's a particular system, you"
124.0,1.469,can say select.
127.33,1.289,All the books.
132.01,2.129,And give me all this data out
134.14,1.559,for me to use.
135.7,2.219,Now we have one particular item
137.92,1.889,"here books, but where it really"
139.81,1.619,"comes, you really see the power of a"
141.43,1.409,relational database.
142.84,2.249,Let's say now I want to
145.09,1.169,show the authors.
150.25,1.229,And the way that relational
151.48,2.129,databases can really provide
153.61,1.589,the structure of relating these two
155.2,1.979,entities together is by
157.18,2.009,describing them through a
159.19,2.339,particular entity or relationships.
161.53,1.589,You have one that you're here about
163.12,2.069,where books can have multiple
165.19,1.589,"authors, so maybe a one."
167.8,1.619,To many.
171.58,1.949,You can have a one
173.53,1.139,to one.
175.86,1.619,And just a couple of relationships
177.48,2.009,you can you can kind of mirror
179.49,1.859,"within the database system, so one"
181.35,1.839,way that I can have this kind of a
183.19,2.359,normalized structure is to say
185.55,1.829,definitely the authors
187.38,1.0,is going to have.
189.39,2.069,Its own particular ID
191.46,2.069,"and name any, any any"
193.53,1.679,any particular order of attributes
195.21,2.249,"that I want to describe there,"
197.46,2.249,but I can also one of these fields
199.71,2.579,can be an actual number
202.29,1.89,that actually relates to the ID.
206.4,1.319,"Of this feel, and this is what's"
207.72,1.409,known as a foreign key.
210.45,1.229,"And of course, there will be a name"
211.68,1.649,"there, so when I do my query, the"
213.33,2.009,"next query I do, I"
215.34,1.889,can reference both these tables
217.23,2.249,"and say, Hey, give me all the books"
219.48,1.379,and give me more of the author
220.86,2.309,information from this table using
223.17,1.859,this foreign key to
225.03,2.159,describe that particular structure
227.19,0.899,there.
228.09,1.349,And you can imagine you'll be
229.44,1.439,running a lot of these queries a
230.88,2.099,"lot, and there are some benefits"
232.98,1.439,or some things that are provided to
234.42,1.859,help with those to speed
236.28,1.949,up these queries and make them
238.23,2.729,operate as efficiently as possible.
240.96,1.529,You have the database will provide
242.49,1.289,ways that you can kind of set an
243.78,1.889,index. Let's say that I'm often
245.67,1.949,querying and always trying to pull
247.62,1.829,out by name or by date.
249.45,1.38,I can set an index.
252.2,1.919,"On this particular column,"
254.12,2.069,which will automatically index all
256.19,1.739,"the values, so the next time you"
257.93,1.619,"run, this query is going to pull"
259.55,2.009,from what we like to call this cache
261.56,1.469,of all the values.
263.03,1.829,"Most importantly, every"
264.86,2.939,"time new roles are added,"
267.8,2.249,records are added to this particular
270.05,2.339,table. The index keeps building
272.39,1.829,"this recent, I like to say,"
274.22,1.709,"cache of all these values, so it's"
275.93,2.069,always keeping up to date
278.0,1.289,to work there.
279.29,1.709,So this is all the characteristics
281.0,2.039,of what you kind of have to model
283.04,1.949,out your particular
284.99,1.469,application that you want to build
286.46,1.919,and describe how the entities
288.38,2.099,are related to each other.
290.48,1.469,Now let's switch over here to some
291.95,1.619,of the benefits that you're going to
293.57,1.929,get out of the box with
295.5,1.699,a relational database
298.31,1.149,that you want to use.
299.46,1.819,The first we'll talk about
301.28,2.249,is actual
303.53,1.0,consistency.
310.08,1.649,"Now, this is useful because let's"
311.73,1.529,say there is some point where I want
313.26,1.439,to run multiple of these
314.7,0.899,transactions.
315.6,1.619,Let's say I'm modeling an inventory
317.22,1.559,system for an E commerce
318.78,2.069,"application, and I have the need"
320.85,1.949,to write several
322.8,2.009,queries in a row that may
324.81,1.829,manage a couple of
326.64,1.499,different subsystems.
328.14,2.339,"But if one of those queries fails,"
330.48,2.009,I want the option to be able
332.49,2.099,to roll back.
336.97,1.889,The whole set of all
338.86,1.229,"those queries, just to make sure"
340.09,2.639,that my data always maintains
342.73,1.949,some consistency there.
344.68,1.949,The second is the option
346.63,3.909,to do stored procedures.
350.54,1.979,Sounds like a very complicated
352.52,1.079,word there.
353.6,2.429,But think of store procedures as
356.03,2.159,the ability to write multiple blocks
358.19,1.979,"or functions of code,"
360.17,1.139,or if there are a certain amount of
361.31,1.739,queries that I continue to always
363.05,2.189,"run, I can kind of model"
365.24,1.859,these. So it takes me less
367.1,1.769,code to write that particular
370.19,1.769,to access that same functionality
371.96,1.409,with less SQL code.
373.37,1.919,And as you start to get into more
375.29,2.309,SQL writing with
377.6,2.039,"relational databases, you'll see"
379.64,1.829,queries can get pretty big.
381.47,1.859,Another way
383.33,1.409,"you can do this, as well as another"
384.74,1.739,topic code views here.
386.48,1.169,Definitely want to introduce some of
387.65,1.889,these keywords as you do your deeper
389.54,1.859,dove. You were able to see a lot
391.4,1.979,of these and it'd be familiar
393.38,0.809,to you.
394.19,2.729,And the last one is a mechanism
396.92,1.859,to handle locking
398.78,1.0,in the database.
401.33,1.14,And concurrency.
405.84,1.439,Why is that important?
410.51,1.919,"Well, at some"
412.43,1.949,point multiple users are going
414.38,1.619,"to want to use the database, maybe"
416.0,1.709,"at the same time, maybe two"
417.71,1.439,applications are going to be adding
419.15,0.899,in books.
420.05,2.099,And if the first application
422.15,1.889,is making a particular
424.04,1.589,insert into this table.
426.63,1.199,You're going to want to make sure
427.83,2.009,that the database is locked until
429.84,1.829,that right is done and then
431.67,2.009,the second application has its
433.68,1.859,ability to go in and make its insert
435.54,0.809,as well.
436.35,2.489,So these are all built into
438.84,1.679,a lot of the relational databases
440.52,0.959,that you use.
441.48,1.679,A lot of these benefits will be
443.16,1.829,"provided for you out of the box, not"
444.99,2.189,necessarily something you'll have to
447.18,1.949,"write in code, but just know"
449.13,2.489,that you'll have this at top of mind
451.62,2.219,when you are kind of selecting
453.84,1.739,to use a relational database for
455.58,1.709,your next project.
457.29,1.289,I hope this is good for you to
458.58,1.889,understand the foundation of
460.47,1.919,relational databases.
