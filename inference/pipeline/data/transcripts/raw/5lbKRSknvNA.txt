0.06,3.48,tonight A Stark warning that artificial
2.22,3.78,intelligence could lead to the
3.54,4.2,extinction of humanity have you ever
6.0,4.44,wondered what could happen if we combine
7.74,5.64,Ai and quantum computers it's both
10.44,4.859,exciting and scary quantum computers are
13.38,3.899,incredibly powerful and can solve
15.299,4.581,complex problems much faster than
17.279,5.34,regular computers but there's a catch
19.88,4.899,renowned physicist Michio Kaku has
22.619,4.08,discovered something terrifying and it
24.779,5.881,could lead to the extinction of humanity
26.699,6.421,so the two of them the chat Bots that
30.66,4.2,are revolution in software and then
33.12,3.84,quantum computers which are Revolution
34.86,4.68,and Hardware when they get together
36.96,5.279,watch out join us as we explore the
39.54,5.1,world of quantum computers and AI their
42.239,4.561,revolutionary potential and the shocking
44.64,4.2,warning from Michio Kaku
46.8,4.2,quantum computers are exceptional
48.84,3.84,computers that revolutionize Computing
51.0,3.96,by operating on the principles of
52.68,4.559,quantum mechanics unlike classical
54.96,4.68,computers that use bits to store and
57.239,4.741,process information quantum computers
59.64,5.339,utilize Quantum bits which are commonly
61.98,6.48,called qubits while classical bits can
64.979,5.161,only be in two states zero or one qubits
68.46,4.08,possess the incredible ability of
70.14,3.839,superposition this means that a qubit
72.54,4.259,can exist in multiple States
73.979,4.861,simultaneously representing both zero
76.799,4.201,and one at the same time
78.84,4.38,this is not just a little advancement in
81.0,4.02,the basis of computation we are talking
83.22,3.84,about a large leap that provides
85.02,4.32,possibilities for solving highly complex
87.06,3.48,problems that our modern computers are
89.34,3.779,limited to
90.54,5.34,the power of quantum computers lies in
93.119,4.561,their capacity for parallel computation
95.88,4.199,by exploring different states and
97.68,4.68,possibilities simultaneously they can
100.079,4.621,potentially solve specific problems much
102.36,4.98,faster than classical computers
104.7,4.44,undoubtedly there is a widespread debate
107.34,2.94,about the use of this revolutionary
109.14,2.88,system
110.28,3.54,at first you could liken it to the
112.02,4.08,regular developments we are making on
113.82,4.74,classical computers increasing the
116.1,4.339,processing power of a single chip
118.56,4.62,but the argument here is quite different
120.439,4.601,the Improvement comes from the basic
123.18,4.32,unit of computing
125.04,4.74,Quantum bits outperform classical bits
127.5,4.2,and this leads to the wide gap between
129.78,4.02,the processing power of quantum
131.7,3.539,computers and conventional computer
133.8,3.9,systems
135.239,3.781,now let's walk through the history of
137.7,3.36,this invention
139.02,5.04,quantum computers have a rich history
141.06,5.399,dating back to the early 1980s when
144.06,4.319,physicist Richard Feynman introduced the
146.459,3.301,Revolutionary concept of quantum
148.379,3.421,computation
149.76,3.54,Feynman envisioned a new kind of
151.8,3.72,computer that could leverage the
153.3,4.68,principles of quantum mechanics to
155.52,5.04,tackle complex problems beyond the
157.98,5.52,capabilities of classical machines
160.56,4.56,however it wasn't until the 1990s that
163.5,3.36,significant breakthroughs in this field
165.12,5.22,began to emerge
166.86,6.54,back in 1994 a mathematician named Peter
170.34,4.979,Shore working at Bell Labs unveiled an
173.4,3.72,algorithm that sent shock waves through
175.319,4.021,the scientific community
177.12,4.32,this algorithm was a game changer for
179.34,4.14,quantum computers because it had an
181.44,4.62,incredible ability to efficiently Factor
183.48,4.74,large numbers now you might be wondering
186.06,4.98,why factoring numbers is such a big deal
188.22,4.92,well it turns out that factoring plays a
191.04,4.5,crucial role in many encryption methods
193.14,4.14,used to protect sensitive information in
195.54,3.96,our digital world today
197.28,4.319,Shore's algorithm opened up a whole new
199.5,4.44,realm of possibilities and sparked both
201.599,4.801,excitement and concerns among scientists
203.94,4.2,it showed how powerful quantum computers
206.4,4.44,could be in Breaking the encryption
208.14,6.36,systems we rely on so throughout the
210.84,5.46,1990s and early 2000s researchers rolled
214.5,3.54,up their sleeves and started exploring
216.3,3.54,different ways to build practical
218.04,3.72,quantum computers
219.84,4.44,one of the most promising approaches
221.76,5.339,involved tinkering with individual atoms
224.28,4.98,or ions to act as qubits which are the
227.099,3.661,building blocks of quantum computers and
229.26,3.72,are the fundamental units of information
230.76,5.52,in Quantum computing
232.98,5.819,in 2001 a group of scientists at IBM
236.28,4.62,achieved a major breakthrough they
238.799,4.381,successfully demonstrated the concept of
240.9,4.559,quantum Computing by using nuclear
243.18,5.339,magnetic resonance to control qubits
245.459,5.7,think of it as an Eureka moment in the
248.519,4.981,world of science this achievement showed
251.159,4.381,that Quantum computation was not just a
253.5,4.56,wild idea but something that could
255.54,4.74,actually work it lit a fire under
258.06,3.6,researchers pushing them to progress
260.28,3.96,even more
261.66,4.319,as time went on scientists made
264.24,4.14,incredible strides in developing
265.979,4.921,stronger and more reliable qubit systems
268.38,4.62,they explored different types of qubits
270.9,4.5,like superconducting circuits and
273.0,4.259,trapped ions each with its own set of
275.4,3.72,advantages and challenges
277.259,3.841,they were trying out different Tools in
279.12,4.74,a Quantum toolbox to see which worked
281.1,4.62,best all these advancements paved the
283.86,4.559,way for the construction of increasingly
285.72,5.28,powerful quantum computers the number of
288.419,4.621,qubits kept growing allowing for more
291.0,4.5,complex calculations and simulations
293.04,5.879,it's like going from a basic calculator
295.5,6.66,to a supercomputer later in 2013
298.919,4.981,something great happened Google and NASA
302.16,4.86,joined forces to create a quantum
303.9,5.04,computer called the d-wave 2. picture it
307.02,4.02,as a high-tech Powerhouse that was going
308.94,4.38,to be housed at NASA's Ames Research
311.04,4.32,Center but guess what a government
313.32,4.26,shutdown came along and threw a wrench
315.36,4.14,in the works it disrupted the project
317.58,4.74,and stopped the quantum computer from
319.5,5.46,reaching its full potential why
322.32,4.26,well it had to do with worries about the
324.96,3.56,potential risks that could come from
326.58,4.14,using such an advanced Computing system
328.52,4.239,even though the computer was up and
330.72,4.259,running the shutdown put a halt to
332.759,4.681,further progress and plans until NASA
334.979,4.981,could get back on track fast forward to
337.44,5.58,2019 and Google was in the headlines
339.96,5.34,again blowing Minds left and right they
343.02,4.86,achieved what's called Quantum Supremacy
345.3,5.339,with their super duper Quantum processor
347.88,5.46,called Sycamore what does that mean
350.639,3.961,well they tackled a complex math problem
353.34,3.54,that would have taken classical
354.6,5.159,computers thousands of years to solve
356.88,5.22,and more interestingly Google's team
359.759,4.261,cracked it in the blink of an eye
362.1,3.9,this accomplishment showed just how
364.02,4.739,incredibly powerful quantum computers
366.0,4.68,can be for specific tasks it got
368.759,4.081,everyone excited and pumped up about the
370.68,4.68,potential of this technology which led
372.84,6.48,to even more investment in the field
375.36,7.559,then in 2020 IBM dropped a bombshell
379.32,5.4,they introduced the ibmq system 1 the
382.919,4.5,very first fully integrated quantum
384.72,4.259,computer designed for commercial use it
387.419,3.78,was like the ultimate dream come true
388.979,4.321,for making quantum computers accessible
391.199,4.141,and practical in the real world
393.3,4.679,just imagine having a quantum computer
395.34,5.52,right at your fingertips ready to tackle
397.979,4.801,all sorts of mind-bending problems
400.86,3.48,all these advancements in Quantum
402.78,3.419,Computing caught the attention of
404.34,4.38,governments and industries worldwide
406.199,4.801,they couldn't resist the Allure of this
408.72,4.319,transformative technology so they
411.0,4.5,started pouring in big bucks to support
413.039,5.041,quantum research initiatives they even
415.5,4.319,set up fancy schmancy Quantum research
418.08,5.1,centers and Labs that brought together
419.819,4.861,smart folks from Academia industry and
423.18,3.6,government agencies
424.68,3.959,although the discovery and full adoption
426.78,4.259,of quantum computers are still in their
428.639,4.761,infancy there are theories that claim
431.039,5.16,that quantum computers or perhaps
433.4,4.96,systems that operate using the logic of
436.199,4.5,quantum Computing might have been in
438.36,4.679,existence in our universe already
440.699,4.681,we are talking about black holes
443.039,3.841,according to Modern scientists the
445.38,3.659,existence of extraterrestrial
446.88,3.12,intelligent life is believed to be
449.039,3.541,probable
450.0,4.74,one intriguing possibility is that they
452.58,4.2,might be utilizing black holes as
454.74,4.62,quantum computers which could explain
456.78,4.919,why we haven't detected their presence
459.36,4.559,this scenario is related to the Fermi
461.699,4.741,Paradox which has puzzled astronomers
463.919,4.081,and cosmologists for years
466.44,3.78,despite the high likelihood of Life
468.0,4.199,existing elsewhere in the universe we
470.22,2.879,are yet to find widespread evidence of
472.199,3.06,it
473.099,5.04,the heart tippler conjecture offers an
475.259,4.921,explanation for this Paradox if Advanced
478.139,4.381,extraterrestrial civilizations have
480.18,5.04,emerged in our galaxy we should observe
482.52,4.5,signs of their activity throughout this
485.22,3.78,conjecture aims to address the question
487.02,3.72,of why we have not encountered clear
489.0,4.86,indications of extraterrestrial
490.74,4.98,civilizations despite the probabilities
493.86,4.739,in connection to this line of debate
495.72,4.74,Michio Kaku suggests the Intriguing
498.599,5.521,notion of an extraterrestrial
500.46,5.579,superhighway beyond Earth a laser-based
504.12,4.68,network through which billions of alien
506.039,5.28,beings may be traversing the Galaxy
508.8,4.679,however determining the existence of
511.319,4.16,such a phenomenon requires us to
513.479,4.381,question our technological capabilities
515.479,4.661,we currently lack the means to
517.86,3.72,definitively prove or disprove the
520.14,3.839,existence of this hypothetical
521.58,5.1,superhighway which could potentially be
523.979,4.741,situated right outside the Earth's orbit
526.68,4.26,as Quantum Computing progresses
528.72,4.26,researchers are busy tackling the
530.94,4.92,remaining technical challenges and
532.98,4.799,striving to scale up Quantum systems the
535.86,4.56,ultimate goal is to unleash the true
537.779,4.74,power of quantum computers enabling them
540.42,4.74,to beat problems that classical machines
542.519,4.741,find incredibly difficult we're talking
545.16,4.56,about highly sophisticated tasks like
547.26,4.98,large-scale optimization complex
549.72,5.28,simulations and supercharged machine
552.24,4.92,learning since qubits act like they have
555.0,4.44,a split personality but in a good way
557.16,4.32,their superposition property allows
559.44,4.26,quantum computers to perform parallel
561.48,4.799,computations and explore multiple
563.7,4.62,possibilities simultaneously it's like
566.279,4.74,having an army of tiny workers tackling
568.32,5.22,different tasks all at once but here's
571.019,4.561,the catch to make Quantum Computing a
573.54,4.44,reality we need to manipulate and
575.58,4.259,control those qubits effectively that's
577.98,5.46,where various physical systems come into
579.839,6.12,play think atoms ions superconducting
583.44,4.44,circuits or even photons
585.959,3.661,systems are carefully crafted and
587.88,4.139,engineered to preserve the delicate
589.62,4.68,Quantum states of the qubits allowing us
592.019,4.021,to perform operations on them
594.3,3.42,when it comes to crunching numbers in
596.04,3.84,the quantum world we have something
597.72,3.84,similar to classical logic gates called
599.88,3.84,Quantum Gates
601.56,4.5,these gates are like the conductors of a
603.72,4.38,Quantum Symphony they dance and
606.06,4.56,manipulate the quantum states of qubits
608.1,4.56,to carry out specific computations
610.62,4.38,by applying a sequence of these gates to
612.66,4.5,a group of qubits we can run Quantum
615.0,5.1,algorithms and solve difficult problems
617.16,5.16,but there's more Quantum Computing has
620.1,5.04,another Edge characteristic quantum
622.32,5.28,entanglement it's like the BFF mode for
625.14,4.44,qubits when qubits become entangled
627.6,4.08,their Fates become intertwined
629.58,3.78,regardless of how far apart they are
631.68,3.599,it's like they're in constant
633.36,4.38,communication no matter the physical
635.279,5.881,distance Einstein once called this
637.74,5.82,spooky action at a distance we like to
641.16,4.799,think of it as a superpower the beauty
643.56,4.68,of entanglement is that it allows qubits
645.959,4.741,within a quantum computer to establish
648.24,5.159,intricate relationships they can work
650.7,5.34,together as a Dream Team processing vast
653.399,4.921,amounts of information simultaneously
656.04,4.62,this gives quantum computers additional
658.32,4.8,potential to solve certain problems way
660.66,4.08,faster than classical computers it's
663.12,4.5,like they have a turbo boost for
664.74,5.58,computational tasks so with qubits
667.62,5.04,superposition Gates and entanglement on
670.32,4.68,the side the future of quantum Computing
672.66,4.14,looks bright they have shown impressive
675.0,4.26,performance in many areas where
676.8,4.92,classical computers struggle for example
679.26,5.1,their Wizards at complex optimization
681.72,5.16,super Speedy at factorizing those big
684.36,4.86,numbers pros at simulating Quantum
686.88,4.139,systems and even masters of advanced
689.22,3.9,machine learning tasks
691.019,3.841,one cool application of quantum
693.12,4.26,computers is in the realm of
694.86,4.2,optimization they can come to the rescue
697.38,3.6,when it comes to solving real world
699.06,4.14,problems like figuring out the best
700.98,4.5,routes managing Supply chains
703.2,4.68,efficiently or allocating resources
705.48,4.44,smartly it's like having a genius
707.88,3.78,advisor who knows all the tricks to
709.92,2.82,optimize things and make our lives
711.66,3.419,easier
712.74,4.32,but hey there's another side to the
715.079,4.32,quantum coin when it comes to
717.06,5.339,cryptography Quantum Computing has
719.399,4.861,caused quite a stir many cryptographic
722.399,4.62,systems rely on the difficulty of
724.26,5.28,factoring in those gigantic numbers and
727.019,4.44,guess what quantum computers can Breeze
729.54,5.22,through that task thanks to a Nifty
731.459,5.521,algorithm called Shores algorithm they
734.76,3.96,have the key to unlock encryption
736.98,4.5,secrets in a Flash
738.72,4.799,a five to ten year time frame Quantum
741.48,3.9,Computing will break encryption as we
743.519,4.681,know it today now this brings up a big
745.38,5.04,concern as quantum computers continue to
748.2,4.199,evolve and become more powerful they
750.42,5.0,pose a Potential Threat to our beloved
752.399,5.641,cryptographic systems but fear not
755.42,4.419,researchers are on the case actively
758.04,4.44,developing what they call Quantum
759.839,5.161,resistant cryptographic algorithms
762.48,4.56,these algorithms are like secret Shields
765.0,3.12,that can withstand attacks from quantum
767.04,2.58,computers
768.12,3.3,they're building them with fancy
769.62,4.32,techniques like lattice based and
771.42,4.02,code-based cryptography to ensure the
773.94,2.94,long-term security of our digital
775.44,4.139,infrastructure
776.88,4.98,quantum computers also hold promise in
779.579,4.081,simulating Quantum systems classical
781.86,3.659,computers struggle to accurately
783.66,4.26,simulate the behavior of quantum
785.519,5.161,particles at the microscopic level due
787.92,5.159,to the complexities of quantum mechanics
790.68,4.08,this limitation has been evident in many
793.079,4.32,simulation systems from space
794.76,5.22,exploration to simulate events across
797.399,4.801,the cosmos especially those related to
799.98,4.2,the microscopic details classical
802.2,4.139,computers have not been the best in
804.18,3.3,performance in terms of accuracy and
806.339,4.381,precision
807.48,5.039,also in fields like medicine simulations
810.72,3.96,aimed at understanding the full
812.519,4.081,functioning of the human body have been
814.68,4.8,limited by the available computational
816.6,5.76,power and Precision in many cases
819.48,4.62,in contrast quantum computers are
822.36,4.38,naturally suited for simulating the
824.1,3.9,behaviors of tiny particles and Quantum

1257.48,2.76,harness the power of quantum computers
1259.28,3.6,fully
1260.24,4.74,also the ethical concerns regarding the
1262.88,4.5,potential impact of quantum computers on
1264.98,4.62,encryption in people's privacy really
1267.38,3.6,bother experts about the wide use of
1269.6,3.18,these systems
1270.98,4.079,since Quantum Computing could break
1272.78,4.019,current encryption methods there is a
1275.059,3.48,need for standardization and more
1276.799,4.021,complex encryption techniques to
1278.539,4.52,eliminate privacy risks before the
1280.82,5.219,general adoption of quantum computers
1283.059,4.601,additionally since Quantum Computing can
1286.039,3.12,have significant implications for
1287.66,4.2,artificial intelligence and machine
1289.159,5.041,learning as we know it today it is

1294.2,4.219,a manner that upholds privacy and
1296.0,5.22,security ensuring responsible use
1298.419,5.14,however just like any other invention
1301.22,4.319,quantum computers should not be too
1303.559,3.841,difficult to handle once rules are set
1305.539,3.781,for their regulated use
1307.4,5.04,by addressing technical challenges
1309.32,5.46,focusing on appropriate applications and

1316.58,5.099,computers and harness their benefits
1318.799,6.36,while safeguarding privacy and societal
1321.679,5.88,values so in simpler terms Quantum
1325.159,4.621,Supremacy has been achieved meaning that
1327.559,4.681,quantum computers can outperform digital
1329.78,4.98,computers in certain problems however
1332.24,5.22,there are concerns raised by physicist
1334.76,5.1,Michio Kaku regarding the combination of
1337.46,5.16,quantum computers and AI
1339.86,4.439,the danger lies in the fact that AI chat
1342.62,3.539,Bots lack the ability to distinguish
1344.299,4.5,between correct and incorrect
1346.159,5.941,information posing risks if not
1348.799,5.88,regulated by laws there is no fact
1352.1,6.48,checker for chat Bots let me repeat that
1354.679,6.421,again there is no fact checker for chat
1358.58,3.959,Bots that is the whole ball of wax
1361.1,3.18,that's the reason why they're so
1362.539,4.081,dangerous because they can they don't
1364.28,3.84,know these chatbots are machines they
1366.62,3.0,don't know what is correct what is
1368.12,4.439,incorrect it's all the same to them
1369.62,4.679,according to physicist Brian Greene it
1372.559,4.561,is plausible that highly Advanced
1374.299,4.681,civilizations May self-destruct offering
1377.12,2.939,a possible explanation for the Fermi
1378.98,4.02,paradox
1380.059,5.521,if life exists beyond Earth why haven't
1383.0,4.44,we encountered it the reasoning is that
1385.58,3.839,civilizations capable of interstellar
1387.44,3.599,travel may have annihilated themselves
1389.419,3.661,before reaching us
1391.039,4.741,tragically this scenario aligns with
1393.08,4.8,historical events on our own planet we
1395.78,4.08,can't be too careful a high-level
1397.88,4.5,Computing system like quantum computers
1399.86,4.199,should be cautiously linked with AI in a
1402.38,3.659,way that we can control
1404.059,4.441,considering these uncertainties and
1406.039,4.26,potential risks Is it wise to Grant
1408.5,4.38,control to machines whose capabilities
1410.299,4.74,remain uncertain we must weigh the
1412.88,4.2,dangers and make informed decisions
1415.039,4.76,despite the Allure of technological
1417.08,2.719,advancements
