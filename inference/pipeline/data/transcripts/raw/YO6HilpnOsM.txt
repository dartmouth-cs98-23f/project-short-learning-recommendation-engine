1.86,4.26,hi guys this is a Claudio motion
4.08,4.92,designer from Brussels of Belgium today
6.12,5.899,we are going to talk about the languages
9.0,5.4,for data visualization and animations
12.019,4.661,there are essential tools for conveying
14.4,4.98,complex information in account size and
16.68,4.74,easy to understand way there are a
19.38,4.94,variety of programming languages out
21.42,5.519,there that can be used for these tasks
24.32,4.9,some are better suited than others for
26.939,5.181,the job of course whether you are a
29.22,5.1,novice programmer or an experienced one
32.12,5.02,learning the best programming languages
34.32,5.52,for data visualization and animation can
37.14,6.96,help you create effective graphs and
39.84,7.62,charts from JavaScript to python to
44.1,5.22,After Effects and Beyond today we are
47.46,4.02,going to explore which are the best
49.32,4.5,programming languages for data
51.48,6.599,visualization as well as the advantages
53.82,7.2,and disadvantages of each one so let's
58.079,5.941,see in detail which are these languages
61.02,3.0,JavaScript
65.339,4.14,JavaScript is an object-oriented
67.26,5.16,programming language that's mainly used
69.479,6.68,for client-side scripting although it's
72.42,6.3,often used for front-end web development
76.159,4.96,JavaScript can be used for many others
78.72,5.759,data visualization and animation tasks
81.119,5.241,such as creating interactive graphs and
84.479,5.041,charts for example
86.36,5.259,d3.js is a popular JavaScript library
89.52,4.94,for visualization but it's not the only
91.619,6.201,one there are literally tens and tens of
94.46,7.18,lib libraries that you can use to create
97.82,5.2,data visualizations and interactive
101.64,3.659,animations
103.02,4.44,as I said there are many other libraries
105.299,4.021,and tools that are compatible with
107.46,4.199,JavaScript making The Versatile
109.32,4.439,programming language JavaScript is an
111.659,5.041,easy programming language to learn and
113.759,5.82,get started with making it a good choice
116.7,5.58,for beginners additionally JavaScript
119.579,4.68,runs on every device and platform making
122.28,4.74,it an excellent choice for creating a
124.259,5.761,cross-platform applications
127.02,3.0,python
130.739,5.401,python is a general purpose programming
133.44,5.519,language that is often used for data
136.14,5.58,analytics and data science and
138.959,5.701,scientific Computing it has a wide range
141.72,4.98,of libraries and tools that allow you to
144.66,4.88,create sophisticated data visualizations
146.7,5.58,and animations for example the
149.54,5.26,matplotlib library allows you to create
152.28,5.34,the charts and graphs and the Seaborn
154.8,5.82,Library allows to create statistical
157.62,4.86,graphs very easily the Python
160.62,3.72,programming language is an excellent
162.48,4.08,choice if you are looking to create data
164.34,5.28,visualization and animation with a lot
166.56,6.179,of complexity and details
169.62,5.58,python is also easy to learn and has a
172.739,5.101,friendly syntax making it a good choice
175.2,5.1,for beginners since python is a
177.84,4.8,cross-platform and open source it's
180.3,5.4,widely used in many Industries and
182.64,6.239,organizations which means that it has a
185.7,5.84,large and active community of users and
188.879,2.661,Developers
193.26,5.399,C plus plus
195.84,4.979,but C plus passage is a general purpose
198.659,4.141,of programming language that is used for
200.819,3.661,everything from web development to
202.8,4.14,computer graphics
204.48,4.619,it's a compiled and object-oriented
206.94,4.439,programming language that allows you to
209.099,4.981,create sophisticated and detailed data
211.379,4.681,visualizations C plus plus has many
214.08,4.739,features that make it an excellent
216.06,5.759,choice for database and animation such
218.819,5.521,as the ability to handle large data sets
221.819,5.521,and high performance functions
224.34,5.22,it has a larger number of libraries and
227.34,4.619,tools that you can use
229.56,5.58,for data visualization such as the
231.959,5.761,opengl library which is used to create a
235.14,4.739,3D computer graphics
237.72,4.439,plus plus is a relatively difficult
239.879,5.041,programming language to learn and isn't
242.159,4.981,ideal for beginners it is however a good
244.92,4.679,choice if you are looking to create a
247.14,4.799,detailed data visualizations with high
249.599,4.34,complexity
251.939,4.98,processing
253.939,5.501,processing is a programming language and
256.919,5.581,environment that is used for visual arts
259.44,5.28,design and computer art it was
262.5,4.68,originally developed for artists and
264.72,3.259,designer to create visual art pieces and
267.18,3.9,images
267.979,4.66,processing Simplicity and ease of use
271.08,3.42,make it a good choice for new
272.639,3.62,programmers to create data
274.5,4.32,visualizations and animations
276.259,5.081,additionally its cross-platform
278.82,5.46,compatibility makes it a good choice for
281.34,5.76,creating web visualizations
284.28,4.8,to visualize your data you can use the
287.1,4.68,built-in functions to create the
289.08,5.839,interactive graphs and visualizations if
291.78,5.34,you are looking to create more complex
294.919,4.06,charts you can use the programming
297.12,4.62,language which is similar to C plus plus
298.979,6.981,on Java and allows you to create a more
301.74,4.22,sophisticated and detailed pieces
305.97,3.81,[Music]
308.18,3.82,Matlab
309.78,5.639,Matlab is a programming language and
312.0,5.639,environment for technical computing
315.419,5.28,personally I used it for the first time
317.639,5.161,during my engineering Statics at the
320.699,4.201,University it's commonly used for
322.8,4.76,Advanced Data animations and
324.9,4.92,visualizations such as 3D
327.56,4.479,visualizations all thought it's mainly
329.82,4.56,used for more advanced and Technical
332.039,4.5,visualizations Matlab is also suitable
334.38,5.58,for non-programmers who are just getting
336.539,6.0,started with database it's a
339.96,6.92,cross-platform and open source making it
342.539,4.341,a good choice for web visualizations
349.8,5.94,r r is not only a letter of the alphabet
353.4,3.54,but it is also an interpret programming
355.74,4.56,language
356.94,6.0,designed in 1993 for statistical
360.3,4.739,Computing and graphics it's commonly
362.94,4.44,used in data science and Big Data
365.039,5.1,applications or data visualization and
367.38,4.98,animation are Essentials
370.139,4.861,are these reviews and accessibility
372.36,4.619,mechanical choice for non-programmers to
375.0,5.639,create visualizations additionally it's
376.979,6.241,across cross-platform and open source so
380.639,4.801,this is a good choice for web data
383.22,5.099,visualizations projects
385.44,5.34,or has many built-in functions that
388.319,4.141,allow you to create statistical graphs
390.78,3.72,and visualizations
392.46,5.519,if you are looking to create more
394.5,6.539,complex data visualizations you can
397.979,6.241,create more complex functions as our
401.039,5.701,supports procedural programming with
404.22,6.259,functions and for some cases object
406.74,3.739,oriented programming as well
413.3,5.8,after effects
415.52,5.739,after effects is a visual effects and
419.1,4.86,Motion Graphics software used to create
421.259,4.621,visualizations and animations it's
423.96,4.079,commonly used for Motion Graphics and
425.88,4.98,web animations transitioning between
428.039,5.641,scenes and animated graphics in general
430.86,5.64,it has a lot of built-in functions and
433.68,6.299,tools that allow you to quickly create
436.5,5.4,animated videos After Effects also
439.979,4.56,allows you to create very artistic
441.9,6.6,animations you can create graphs and
444.539,6.181,charts either 2D or 3D with ease if you
448.5,4.979,are looking to create more complex data
450.72,4.02,visualizations you can use the scripting
453.479,4.5,languages
454.74,5.16,and expressions which are included in
457.979,3.541,After Effects and are based on
459.9,3.299,JavaScript
461.52,4.079,if you are a motion designer and need to
463.199,4.741,create a bar chart races and bytes pie
465.599,4.38,charts you can choose Barber chart which
467.94,4.62,is a bar chart race script for After
469.979,5.16,Effects but if you don't like script in
472.56,5.16,our expression so there's really large
475.139,6.0,number of data visualization templates
477.72,5.94,for after effects on the internet I'm
481.139,4.741,gonna link leave some links in the
483.66,4.159,description below
485.88,4.86,foreign
487.819,4.961,data visualizations and animations with
490.74,4.5,programming languages is a great way to
492.78,4.859,present data in an engaging and easy to
495.24,4.2,understand way when choosing which
497.639,4.261,programming language to use you should
499.44,5.099,consider your skill level the complexity
501.9,4.979,of your project and the oppressed in
504.539,5.1,system of your target device or platform
506.879,5.16,note that you know more about the best
509.639,5.28,programming languages for data
512.039,6.68,visualization and animation it's time to
514.919,6.661,put your newfound knowledge to good use
518.719,5.5,ultimately the best choice of language
521.58,5.759,or framework will depend on your
524.219,5.461,specific needs and goals as well as your
527.339,4.021,existing skills and experience it's
