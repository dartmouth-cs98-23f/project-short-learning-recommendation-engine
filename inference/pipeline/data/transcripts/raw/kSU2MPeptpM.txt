0.0,2.134,Dear students welcome to Gate Smashers
2.334,1.61,In this video I am going to explain
4.144,2.804,SDLC that is Software Development Life Cycle
7.148,2.074,If we talk about this topic
9.422,1.838,Or even if talk about software engineering
11.46,1.853,This subject is a lot in demand
13.513,1.812,We get a lot of comments
15.525,1.037,We also get a lot of mails
16.762,1.037,That start this subject
17.999,2.767,But if tell you personally and genuinely
20.966,1.663,I had not started this subject because
22.829,2.889,I have not studied this subject with heart
25.918,2.512,Whenever we used to study this subject in B.Tech
28.63,1.085,Or whenever we have studied
29.915,1.286,We have studied just to pass the exam
31.401,1.405,We always used to feel that
33.006,2.368,This is theory so you can just mug up the theory
35.574,2.995,What is it's importance in real life
38.769,0.904,Where is it used
39.873,2.054,What is it's purpose actually
42.127,0.908,That we had not seen
43.235,1.239,Actually we had never felt
44.674,1.743,But if I talk now
46.617,1.18,Then I can tell you now that
47.997,3.012,Yes actually I am telling with my own experience
51.209,2.502,That this subject has got a lot of importance
53.911,2.398,If I give it's real life example
56.509,1.906,Then when we do a startup
58.615,1.76,Or if we go in entrepreneurship
60.575,1.489,Then actually we come to know that
62.264,2.598,This theory is quite important
65.062,3.612,We actually complete phases one by one
68.874,6.511,And I will tell all these points with my own experience with real life example
75.585,1.899,So that you don't find it boring
77.684,3.469,You come to know that yes actually it is important
81.353,1.567,The theory that we study
83.12,1.881,That is actually important
85.201,3.98,So that I am telling you first of all we will talk about software development life cycle
89.381,5.102,Because I have already made a video on the basic
94.683,3.306,So the first important topic that comes is
98.189,1.196,Software development life cycle
99.585,2.378,In which we talk about there is a cycle
102.163,2.435,Cycle means we have different phases
104.798,4.144,We are developing a software through those phases
109.142,4.404,And to develop a software a cycle or a systematic way
113.746,1.318,Why is it necessary
115.264,5.651,Because customer is investing his time and his money
121.115,2.449,And the company which is providing him service
123.764,2.117,Somewhere it has to make its name
126.081,1.494,So that it can get multiple projects
127.775,2.957,So somewhere the requirement of customer
130.932,2.208,We have to satisfy it properly
133.34,3.663,We have to properly implement the requirement of customer
137.203,2.322,And my cost also should be genuine
139.725,2.221,I have to work within time frame
142.146,3.188,So when we have to do all these things actually in real life
145.534,2.719,When we need a systematic approach
148.453,3.012,That is actually a software development life cycle
151.665,1.783,Over here we have 2 entities
153.648,1.34,One is the customer
155.188,3.661,There are 2 people one is customer and another is the service provider
159.049,2.431,There can be one customer also and multiple customer also
161.68,2.645,And a service provider obviously there is a very big team
164.525,1.199,Small team can also be there
165.924,2.584,That depends but if we see a general aspect
168.708,2.515,Then there is a customer and a service provider
171.423,3.077,So over here as we are making our platform
174.7,6.354,So we are the customer and the company with which we have done the tie up is a service provider
181.254,2.727,So which is the first phase? Planning phase
184.181,3.203,Planning phase means it is initial time
187.584,3.008,When we have an idea in mind that we are doing this work
190.792,2.082,We have this unique idea
193.074,2.762,We implemented that idea in market
196.036,1.48,As we talk about youtube
197.716,1.991,Our channel is quite famous
199.907,5.857,Now we want that we can provide many good courses to students through this channel
205.964,1.947,And it is not that only one thing
208.111,1.271,Like if I talk about myself
209.582,1.913,Then only I cannot do all the things
211.695,2.844,Because we also have our quality constraint
214.739,1.225,That we have to give the best quality
216.164,1.882,So I cannot teach all the things alone
218.246,1.913,I also have to bring multiple instructors
220.359,0.885,Each and everything I have to do
221.444,2.382,So over there comes a planning phase
224.026,2.621,I want all those things in planning phase
226.847,2.779,"I want this type of dashboard, students should be able to login like this"
229.826,2.77,In that which type of content students should get
232.796,0.91,How will they get PDF
233.906,1.178,How will they get video lectures
235.284,1.405,How they can give quiz
236.889,1.636,How should be the landing page
238.725,2.191,This comes in our mind
241.116,1.389,This is my planning
242.705,2.109,Now along with that planning I also know that
245.014,1.41,How much cost I can give
246.624,1.322,How much time do I have
248.146,3.978,In that I have kept an idea in my mind
252.324,1.943,Now what will I do I will call
254.467,5.521,Obviously nowadays in social media and online also marketing is available
260.188,1.537,So over there I can put that
261.925,2.302,That this is my requirement
264.427,2.342,So tell me if anyone has such a company
266.969,1.664,Or if any person is working on this
268.833,0.5,Then tell me
269.508,3.789,Obviously multiple service provider will reach me
273.497,1.063,They will call me
274.76,2.54,So over there the first phase will be there of planning
277.5,1.493,And then what they will do
279.193,1.614,I will get quotations from them
281.007,1.775,Tell me how much cost will be incurred
282.982,1.225,I will tell all the things to them
284.407,4.163,So you can see over here our verbal communication will be there
288.77,3.379,Informal or formal kind of communication can be done
292.349,3.496,Defensive the project is very big then obviously formal will be more
296.045,1.908,If it is a limited or small project
298.153,1.928,Then informal kind of communication will also do
300.281,2.53,And after that when I have told all my things
303.011,3.067,So after that comes defining or analysis phase
306.278,2.46,Now a person has an idea in his mind
308.938,2.685,Service provider has got an idea in his mind
311.823,1.478,That this is customers requirement
313.501,3.473,Now we will share that requirement with his team
317.174,1.806,After sharing it with team
319.18,4.719,He will get an estimation that I can keep this much price
324.099,1.813,I will require this much staff
326.112,3.487,The estimation work COCOMO and line of code
329.799,0.575,Function point
330.574,2.031,All that funda comes on this point
332.805,4.012,What you will do all the analysis on the basis of which he will tell this will be my cost
337.017,1.378,I will take this much charges
338.595,0.72,I will take this much time
339.515,1.541,Then customer will tell about him
341.256,1.501,That I can pay only this much money
342.957,1.929,Or I want to get the work done within this much time
345.086,2.289,So somewhere they will do the negotiation
347.575,2.071,Now after doing the negotiation
349.846,6.929,Nawab after that a proper documentation comes that is called as SRS documentation
356.975,1.245,It comes over here in this phase
358.42,2.272,When they had communication with each other
360.892,1.273,Verbal communication is done
362.365,2.872,But in the end I want it in written
365.437,2.339,So in return we got a formal document from them
367.976,2.709,But these will be the modules and we have told them each and everything
370.885,4.255,But it does not mean that over here customers work is over
375.34,2.15,Now customer cannot do any changes
377.69,2.979,Customers can do his changes afterwards also
380.869,3.351,But what happens is customer might tell something earlier
384.42,2.279,And after that he keeps on making the changes again and again
386.899,1.876,So somewhere you will be stuck in this loop only
388.975,2.432,Over here only customer and service provider will be stuck
391.607,4.928,So you can tell that 70-60% idea is to be delivered
396.735,1.859,It is there in his mind
398.794,3.223,Now whatever changes you want to add on in this
402.217,0.728,That you will keep on doing it
403.145,1.447,According to the time
404.792,2.179,So this SRS document work is done
407.171,2.219,After that designing phase comes
409.59,2.196,What comes in designing phase
411.986,2.116,Now in this the customer does not have any major role
414.302,1.262,Service provider has a major role
415.764,3.426,Designing phase cohesion and coupling comes
419.39,0.971,Which functions are there
420.561,1.154,How are the modules
421.915,1.997,What will be the cohesion and coupling between them
424.112,2.461,Other than this if we talk DFD's and all
426.773,3.691,If you make any project in your university or college
430.664,2.97,You might have used DFD and UML in it
433.834,1.994,So that comes in designing phase
436.028,2.734,Now if I talk about real life example in designing phase
438.962,1.999,You will get a lot in theory
441.161,1.601,If I talk about real life example
442.962,1.96,So it is possible that somewhere
445.122,2.598,Let you can tell design at your end
447.92,1.131,I want this designing
449.251,2.341,I want this type of front page I want this type of landing page
451.792,1.187,You told each and everything
453.179,4.31,May be you took example of 3 to 4 website and told them
457.689,1.561,That I want this type of work
459.45,1.741,You can bring more advancement in this
461.391,2.153,In the same way service provider also told you that
463.744,1.338,We will do designing in this way
465.282,1.272,These are the phases
466.754,2.211,Each and everything came over there in designing phase
469.165,5.378,Designing helps in coding and implementation part
474.743,5.135,It is not that the coding person will directly start coding the SRS document
480.078,0.627,Let us not like that
480.905,3.378,In designing phase a whole layout is prepared
484.483,2.713,Let I want to make things this way
487.396,1.696,And these are my platforms
489.292,3.287,They have made a layout and designing phase
492.779,2.191,Like we make a map before making the house
495.17,0.768,From an architect
496.138,1.239,Designing phase is similar
497.577,1.657,And if we talk about DBMS
499.434,0.915,Like ER modelling
500.549,1.691,That comes in designing phase
502.44,3.111,Now later on it will be added to the implementation phase
505.751,3.402,You will put it in coding phase which platform you are using
509.353,3.136,At backend which technology you are actually using
512.689,1.498,Which language you are using
514.387,1.6,All that things come over here
516.187,5.572,So somewhere service provider will use latest technique and technologies
521.959,2.864,He will do this coding and implementation part
525.023,1.381,Then testing
526.604,1.814,Very important phase because
528.618,2.332,Whatever project you have
531.15,1.888,It is not that the project is deployed
533.238,1.772,We have launched it in the market
535.21,1.657,That means it will be a hit
537.067,2.223,And all the things that we want will be working
539.49,0.5,No
540.077,2.758,When actually the product comes into the market
543.035,5.104,Then we actually come to know that it has some problem
548.339,2.048,When it will come in the hand of customer
550.587,2.033,And customer will give it to its users ahead
552.82,2.492,When users tell on daily basis
555.512,1.562,That actually these are the changes
557.274,1.316,These things are missing in it
558.79,2.046,So somewhere the testing phase
561.036,1.628,There are many type of testing
562.864,1.841,Unit testing is there integration testing is there
564.905,1.139,There are different levels
566.244,2.466,Other than that system testing alpha beta
568.91,1.977,If we talk about types of testing
571.087,2.165,White box testing is there black box testing is there
573.452,1.915,So they are the different types
575.567,1.556,But if you talk about deployment
577.323,2.355,Okay your product is delivered
579.878,1.196,Testing and all is done
581.274,1.297,You have deployed it
582.771,0.605,Properly
583.576,2.671,And along with that also maintenance comes
586.447,2.468,In maintenance generally Technical Support comes
589.115,1.54,If I talk in real life example
590.855,2.244,Then they give it to you like Technical Support
593.299,2.176,They give you time of 3 months
595.675,2.129,After delivering they will give you a complete demo
598.004,1.619,That it works in this way
599.823,2.847,You tell your users how to log in
602.87,0.981,Each and everything they will tell you
604.051,1.636,And they will also give you time of 3 to 4 months
605.887,2.493,That whatever changes you want to get done in 3 to 4 months
608.58,0.956,You get it done
609.736,3.012,And if you want to do anything after that
612.948,2.928,Then there are also some charges on that basis
616.076,2.061,Those charges can be on yearly basis
618.337,1.203,They can also be on monthly basis
619.74,0.567,That depends
620.507,2.909,Then the maintenance fund comes
623.616,2.621,After that the whole cycle
626.437,1.15,Is completed
627.787,5.843,Now over here if we talk and anywhere it is asked to you in college or university exam
633.83,0.915,Or in any interview
634.945,2.744,So I feel this from my experience
637.889,4.366,Yes in real life actually it is important
642.455,2.19,Because we think this as a theory part
644.845,1.906,Baby still you might feel it as a theory part
646.951,3.87,But later on when you will work in a software company
651.021,2.47,Or as a startup or when you will go as an entrepreneur
653.691,4.374,Then you will actually feel that this thing is very important
658.265,4.77,This tells you how you have to work in a systematic way
663.235,2.852,Or how you have to make your employees work
666.287,2.656,Or the company with which you have done the tie up
669.143,2.053,How you have to give them input
671.396,1.467,How you have to arrange meetings with them
673.063,1.405,How in a proper way
674.668,1.355,Your platform your website
676.223,1.423,Your app each and everything
677.846,1.161,You want to get it developed
679.207,1.475,So this whole concept
680.882,3.808,This is actually called the software development life cycle
684.89,3.302,And this if you talk from olden times till now
688.392,1.776,There are many different models
690.368,1.705,Like waterfall model
692.273,1.67,It is very important waterfall model
694.143,2.919,In which iterative waterfall is also there or if we talk about
697.262,2.771,Your traditional waterfall model is there
700.233,1.497,Then prototype is there
701.93,1.031,Spiral model is there
703.161,0.727,Then RAD is there
704.088,1.721,Other then that V-model is there
706.009,1.898,"Agile is there, latest technology"
708.107,1.735,So these are the different models in it
710.042,1.984,Again that is also a theoretical part
712.226,2.785,But I am actually telling you the scenario
715.211,2.273,That how do we implement it
717.684,2.374,What is its importance in real life
720.258,0.531,Thank you
