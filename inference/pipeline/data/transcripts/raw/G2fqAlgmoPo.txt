0.0,1.125,GWENDOLYN STRIPLING: Hello.
1.125,2.894,"And welcome to Introduction
to Generative AI."
4.019,2.671,"My name is Dr.
Gwendolyn Stripling."
6.69,2.85,"And I am the
artificial intelligence"
9.54,5.08,"technical curriculum developer
here at Google Cloud."
14.62,3.87,"In this course, you learn
to define generative AI,"
18.49,4.59,"explain how generative AI works,
describe generative AI model"
23.08,5.31,"types, and describe
generative AI applications."
28.39,3.57,"Generative AI is a type
of artificial intelligence"
31.96,4.21,"technology that can produce
various types of content,"
36.17,4.88,"including text, imagery,
audio, and synthetic data."
41.05,3.04,"But what is artificial
intelligence?"
44.09,1.94,"Well, since we are
going to explore"
46.03,2.53,"generative artificial
intelligence,"
48.56,2.57,let's provide a bit of context.
51.13,2.01,"So two very common
questions asked"
53.14,2.67,"are what is artificial
intelligence"
55.81,4.41,"and what is the difference
between AI and machine"
60.22,1.26,learning.
61.48,4.38,"One way to think about it
is that AI is a discipline,"
65.86,2.43,like physics for example.
68.29,2.94,"AI is a branch of
computer science"
71.23,3.78,"that deals with the creation
of intelligence agents, which"
75.01,5.54,"are systems that can reason,
and learn, and act autonomously."
80.55,4.14,"Essentially, AI has to do
with the theory and methods"
84.69,5.5,"to build machines that
think and act like humans."
90.19,2.83,"In this discipline, we
have machine learning,"
93.02,2.57,which is a subfield of AI.
95.59,4.62,"It is a program or system that
trains a model from input data."
100.21,2.61,"That trained model can
make useful predictions"
102.82,3.06,"from new or never
before seen data"
105.88,4.08,"drawn from the same one
used to train the model."
109.96,1.98,"Machine learning
gives the computer"
111.94,4.53,"the ability to learn without
explicit programming."
116.47,2.97,"Two of the most common classes
of machine learning models"
119.44,4.35,"are unsupervised and
supervised ML models."
123.79,1.95,"The key difference
between the two"
125.74,3.929,"is that, with supervised
models, we have labels."
129.669,5.011,"Labeled data is data that comes
with a tag like a name, a type,"
134.68,1.56,or a number.
136.24,4.39,"Unlabeled data is data
that comes with no tag."
140.63,2.76,"This graph is an
example of the problem"
143.39,2.82,"that a supervised model
might try to solve."
146.21,3.57,"For example, let's say you
are the owner of a restaurant."
149.78,2.59,"You have historical
data of the bill amount"
152.37,3.77,"and how much different people
tipped based on order type"
156.14,3.36,"and whether it was
picked up or delivered."
159.5,3.48,"In supervised learning, the
model learns from past examples"
162.98,4.26,"to predict future values,
in this case tips."
167.24,2.73,"So here the model uses
the total bill amount"
169.97,4.26,"to predict the future tip amount
based on whether an order was"
174.23,2.79,picked up or delivered.
177.02,1.82,"This is an example
of the problem"
178.84,3.49,"that an unsupervised
model might try to solve."
182.33,2.75,"So here you want to look
at tenure and income"
185.08,2.97,"and then group or
cluster employees"
188.05,3.12,"to see whether someone
is on the fast track."
191.17,3.36,"Unsupervised problems
are all about discovery,"
194.53,4.41,"about looking at the raw data
and seeing if it naturally"
198.94,2.81,falls into groups.
201.75,2.9,"Let's get a little deeper
and show this graphically"
204.65,2.88,"as understanding
these concepts are"
207.53,4.26,"the foundation for your
understanding of generative AI."
211.79,4.08,"In supervised learning,
testing data values or x"
215.87,2.01,are input into the model.
217.88,4.62,"The model outputs a prediction
and compares that prediction"
222.5,3.36,"to the training data
used to train the model."
225.86,4.89,"If the predicted test data
values and actual training data"
230.75,3.63,"values are far apart,
that's called error."
234.38,2.55,"And the model tries
to reduce this error"
236.93,4.65,"until the predicted and actual
values are closer together."
241.58,4.13,"This is a classic
optimization problem."
245.71,1.7,"Now that we've
explored the difference"
247.41,3.06,"between artificial intelligence
and machine learning,"
250.47,3.39,"and supervised and
unsupervised learning,"
253.86,2.669,"let's briefly explore
where deep learning"
256.529,4.111,"fits as a subset of
machine learning methods."
260.64,1.95,"While machine learning
is a broad field that"
262.59,2.49,"encompasses many
different techniques,"
265.08,2.31,"deep learning is a type
of machine learning"
267.39,2.4,"that uses artificial
neural networks,"
269.79,3.18,"allowing them to process more
complex patterns than machine"
272.97,1.5,learning.
274.47,3.41,"Artificial neural networks are
inspired by the human brain."
277.88,3.81,"They are made up of many
interconnected nodes or neurons"
281.69,4.44,"that can learn to perform tasks
by processing data and making"
286.13,1.14,predictions.
287.27,2.49,"Deep learning models
typically have many layers"
289.76,2.67,"of neurons, which
allows them to learn"
292.43,3.45,"more complex patterns than
traditional machine learning"
295.88,0.84,models.
296.72,4.12,"And neural networks can use
both labeled and unlabeled data."
300.84,2.69,"This is called
semi-supervised learning."
303.53,2.73,"In semi-supervised
learning, a neural network"
306.26,2.88,"is trained on a small
amount of labeled data"
309.14,3.45,"and a large amount
of unlabeled data."
312.59,2.61,"The labeled data helps
the neural network"
315.2,2.55,"to learn the basic
concepts of the task"
317.75,3.21,"while the unlabeled data
helps the neural network"
320.96,3.58,to generalize to new examples.
324.54,3.18,"Now we finally get to
where generative AI"
327.72,2.67,fits into this AI discipline.
330.39,3.18,"Gen AI is a subset of
deep learning, which"
333.57,2.97,"means it uses artificial
neural networks,"
336.54,3.87,"can process both labeled
and unlabeled data using"
340.41,5.49,"supervised, unsupervised,
and semi-supervised methods."
345.9,5.42,"Large language models are also
a subset of deep learning."
351.32,2.99,"Deep learning models, or machine
learning models in general,"
354.31,5.325,"can be divided into two types,
generative and discriminative."
359.635,2.655,"A discriminative model
is a type of model"
362.29,4.23,"that is used to classify or
predict labels for data points."
366.52,1.56,"Discriminative
models are typically"
368.08,2.88,"trained on a data set
of labeled data points."
370.96,3.57,"And they learn the relationship
between the features"
374.53,2.82,"of the data points
and the labels."
377.35,3.13,"Once a discriminative
model is trained,"
380.48,4.7,"it can be used to predict the
label for new data points."
385.18,3.21,"A generative model
generates new data instances"
388.39,5.22,"based on a learned probability
distribution of existing data."
393.61,4.46,"Thus generative models
generate new content."
398.07,2.19,Take this example here.
400.26,2.73,"The discriminative model learns
the conditional probability"
402.99,2.79,"distribution or the
probability of y,"
405.78,4.29,"our output, given x, our
input, that this is a dog"
410.07,4.41,"and classifies it as
a dog and not a cat."
414.48,3.78,"The generative model learns the
joint probability distribution"
418.26,3.84,"or the probability of
x and y and predicts"
422.1,3.15,"the conditional probability
that this is a dog"
425.25,4.18,"and can then generate
a picture of a dog."
429.43,2.54,"So to summarize,
generative models"
431.97,4.56,"can generate new data instances
while discriminative models"
436.53,4.94,"discriminate between different
kinds of data instances."
441.47,2.13,"The top image shows
a traditional machine"
443.6,1.98,"learning model which
attempts to learn"
445.58,3.3,"the relationship between
the data and the label,"
448.88,1.71,or what you want to predict.
450.59,2.88,"The bottom image shows
a generative AI model"
453.47,3.51,"which attempts to learn
patterns on content so that it"
456.98,3.12,can generate new content.
460.1,3.74,"A good way to distinguish
what is gen AI and what is not"
463.84,2.53,is shown in this illustration.
466.37,5.01,"It is not gen AI when the
output, or y, or label is"
471.38,4.38,"a number or a class, for
example spam or not spam,"
475.76,1.86,or a probability.
477.62,5.55,"It is gen AI when the output is
natural language, like speech"
483.17,5.44,"or text, an image or
audio, for example."
488.61,3.42,"Visualizing this mathematically
would look like this."
492.03,2.31,"If you haven't seen
this for a while,"
494.34,4.56,"the y is equal to f of
x equation calculates"
498.9,4.38,"the dependent output of a
process given different inputs."
503.28,2.1,"The y stands for
the model output."
505.38,3.69,"The f embodies the function
used in the calculation."
509.07,4.21,"And the x represents the input
or inputs used for the formula."
513.28,3.379,"So the model output is a
function of all the inputs."
516.659,4.741,"If the y is the number,
like predicted sales,"
521.4,2.04,it is not gen AI.
523.44,3.3,"If y is a sentence,
like define sales,"
526.74,4.74,"it is generative as the question
would elicit a text response."
531.48,4.23,"The response would be based
on all the massive large data"
535.71,3.54,"the model was
already trained on."
539.25,4.2,"To summarize at a high level,
the traditional, classical"
543.45,2.55,"supervised and unsupervised
learning process"
546.0,3.93,"takes training code and
label data to build a model."
549.93,2.49,"Depending on the
use case or problem,"
552.42,2.88,"the model can give
you a prediction."
555.3,3.33,"It can classify something
or cluster something."
558.63,3.81,"We use this example to show
you how much more robust"
562.44,2.85,the gen AI process is.
565.29,3.78,"The gen AI process can take
training code, label data,"
569.07,2.46,"and unlabeled data
of all data types"
571.53,1.77,and build a foundation model.
573.3,3.12,"The foundation model can
then generate new content."
576.42,6.18,"For example, text, code,
images, audio, video, et cetera."
582.6,2.58,"We've come a long away from
traditional programming"
585.18,3.12,"to neural networks
to generative models."
588.3,1.98,"In traditional
programming, we used"
590.28,3.06,"to have to hard code the rules
for distinguishing a cat--"
593.34,7.05,"the type, animal; legs,
four; ears, two; fur, yes;"
600.39,2.67,likes yarn and catnip.
603.06,2.25,"In the wave of
neural networks, we"
605.31,2.61,"could give the network
pictures of cats and dogs"
607.92,4.85,"and ask is this a cat and
it would predict a cat."
612.77,2.97,"In the generative
wave, we as users"
615.74,3.03,"can generate our own
content, whether it"
618.77,4.32,"be text, images, audio,
video, et cetera, for example"
623.09,3.27,"models like PaLM or
Pathways Language Model,"
626.36,3.78,"or LAMBDA, Language Model
for Dialogue Applications,"
630.14,3.3,"ingest very, very large data
from the multiple sources"
633.44,2.85,"across the internet and
build foundation language"
636.29,4.5,"models we can use simply
by asking a question,"
640.79,2.94,"whether typing it into
a prompt or verbally"
643.73,2.17,talking into the prompt itself.
645.9,2.9,"So when you ask it
what's a cat, it"
648.8,3.81,"can give you everything it
has learned about a cat."
652.61,2.4,"Now we come to our
formal definition."
655.01,2.52,What is generative AI?
657.53,2.49,"Gen AI is a type of
artificial intelligence"
660.02,2.88,"that creates new content
based on what it has"
662.9,2.25,learned from existing content.
665.15,2.37,"The process of learning
from existing content"
667.52,3.06,"is called training and
results in the creation"
670.58,3.3,"of a statistical model
when given a prompt."
673.88,4.38,"AI uses the model to predict
what an expected response might"
678.26,3.72,"be and this generates
new content."
681.98,2.37,"Essentially, it learns
the underlying structure"
684.35,2.58,"of the data and
can then generate"
686.93,4.5,"new samples that are similar
to the data it was trained on."
691.43,4.44,"As previously mentioned, a
generative language model"
695.87,2.85,"can take what it has learned
from the examples it's"
698.72,2.91,"been shown and create
something entirely new"
701.63,1.77,based on that information.
703.4,4.41,"Large language models are
one type of generative AI"
707.81,4.5,"since they generate novel
combinations of text"
712.31,3.87,"in the form of natural
sounding language."
716.18,2.97,"A generative image
model takes an image"
719.15,5.35,"as input and can output text,
another image, or video."
724.5,2.84,"For example, under
the output text,"
727.34,2.34,"you can get visual
question answering"
729.68,5.1,"while under output image, an
image completion is generated."
734.78,4.53,"And under output video,
animation is generated."
739.31,3.45,"A generative language
model takes text as input"
742.76,4.83,"and can output more text, an
image, audio, or decisions."
747.59,2.1,"For example, under
the output text,"
749.69,1.71,question answering is generated.
751.4,4.34,"And under output image,
a video is generated."
755.74,3.03,"We've stated that generative
language models learn"
758.77,2.97,"about patterns and language
through training data,"
761.74,4.77,"then, given some text, they
predict what comes next."
766.51,4.23,"Thus generative language models
are pattern matching systems."
770.74,4.15,"They learn about patterns
based on the data you provide."
774.89,2.28,Here is an example.
777.17,2.76,"Based on things it's learned
from its training data,"
779.93,3.76,"it offers predictions of how
to complete this sentence,"
783.69,5.74,"I'm making a sandwich with
peanut butter and jelly."
789.43,2.67,"Here is the same
example using Bard,"
792.1,3.3,"which is trained on a
massive amount of text data"
795.4,2.31,"and is able to
communicate and generate"
797.71,4.02,"humanlike text in response
to a wide range of prompts"
801.73,1.8,and questions.
803.53,2.32,Here is another example.
805.85,3.2,The meaning of life is--
809.05,2.97,"and Bart gives you
a contextual answer"
812.02,3.66,"and then shows the highest
probability response."
815.68,4.65,"The power of generative AI comes
from the use of transformers."
820.33,2.85,"Transformers produced
a 2018 revolution"
823.18,2.22,in natural language processing.
825.4,2.55,"At a high level, a
transformer model"
827.95,2.68,"consists of an
encoder and decoder."
830.63,2.39,"The encoder encodes
the input sequence"
833.02,2.58,"and passes it to
the decoder, which"
835.6,3.12,"learns how to decode
the representation"
838.72,2.43,for a relevant task.
841.15,5.19,"In transformers, hallucinations
are words or phrases"
846.34,2.85,"that are generated
by the model that"
849.19,4.47,"are often nonsensical or
grammatically incorrect."
853.66,3.52,"Hallucinations can be caused
by a number of factors,"
857.18,4.25,"including the model is not
trained on enough data,"
861.43,4.2,"or the model is trained
on noisy or dirty data,"
865.63,3.81,"or the model is not
given enough context,"
869.44,3.57,"or the model is not
given enough constraints."
873.01,2.52,"Hallucinations can be a
problem for transformers"
875.53,4.5,"because they can make the output
text difficult to understand."
880.03,1.83,"They can also make
the model more"
881.86,4.83,"likely to generate incorrect
or misleading information."
886.69,3.12,"A prompt is a
short piece of text"
889.81,3.6,"that is given to the large
language model as input."
893.41,4.17,"And it can be used to control
the output of the model"
897.58,1.74,in a variety of ways.
899.32,2.58,"Prompt design is the
process of creating"
901.9,3.09,"a prompt that will
generate the desired output"
904.99,2.66,from a large language model.
907.65,4.08,"As previously mentioned,
gen AI depends a lot"
911.73,3.03,"on the training data that
you have fed into it."
914.76,3.51,"And it analyzes the patterns
and structures of the input data"
918.27,1.95,and thus learns.
920.22,3.66,"But with access to a browser
based prompt, you, the user,"
923.88,3.54,can generate your own content.
927.42,4.15,"We've shown illustrations of the
types of input based upon data."
931.57,2.39,"Here are the
associated model types."
933.96,1.68,Text-to-text.
935.64,3.06,"Text-to-text models take
a natural language input"
938.7,2.01,and produces a text output.
940.71,2.52,"These models are trained
to learn the mapping"
943.23,2.19,"between a pair of text, e.g."
945.42,4.32,"for example, translation
from one language to another."
949.74,1.2,Text-to-image.
950.94,3.99,"Text-to-image models are trained
on a large set of images,"
954.93,3.36,"each captioned with a
short text description."
958.29,3.15,"Diffusion is one method
used to achieve this."
961.44,3.03,Text-to-video and text-to-3D.
964.47,3.78,"Text-to-video models aim to
generate a video representation"
968.25,1.65,from text input.
969.9,4.02,"The input text can be anything
from a single sentence"
973.92,1.5,to a full script.
975.42,4.8,"And the output is a video that
corresponds to the input text."
980.22,3.57,"Similarly, text-to-3D
models generate"
983.79,4.41,"three dimensional objects that
correspond to a user's text"
988.2,1.41,description.
989.61,5.3,"For example, this can be used
in games or other 3D worlds."
994.91,1.59,Text-to-task.
996.5,4.62,"Text-to-task models are trained
to perform a defined task"
1001.12,3.0,or action based on text input.
1004.12,2.52,"This task can be a
wide range of actions"
1006.64,4.26,"such as answering a question,
performing a search,"
1010.9,4.33,"making a prediction, or
taking some sort of action."
1015.23,2.99,"For example, a
text-to-task model"
1018.22,5.34,"could be trained to navigate a
web UI or make changes to a doc"
1023.56,1.44,through the GUI.
1025.0,3.69,"A foundation model is a
large AI model pre-trained"
1028.69,4.649,"on a vast quantity of data
designed to be adapted or fine"
1033.339,3.931,"tuned to a wide range
of downstream tasks,"
1037.27,5.04,"such as sentiment analysis,
