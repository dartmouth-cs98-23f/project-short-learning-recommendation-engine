0.16,3.2,web-based and non-web-based transaction
2.24,3.36,processing systems
3.36,3.919,a brief overview so we're going to take
5.6,3.36,a look at the two classifications of
7.279,2.481,these types of transaction processing
8.96,3.679,systems
9.76,4.16,side by side so firstly is web-based
12.639,1.92,where the storage location of the
13.92,2.8,database
14.559,3.681,file is accessed by the internet in
16.72,2.88,order to connect to a server
18.24,3.119,so you need to be connected to the
19.6,2.48,internet if you're going to access this
21.359,2.401,system
22.08,3.68,and that's how you'll get to the server
23.76,3.599,there probably are areas on site too
25.76,2.08,where you can access the actual server
27.359,2.32,as well
27.84,3.359,but predominantly it has internet
29.679,1.92,connection and thus users from over the
31.199,2.321,world
31.599,5.281,could connect to this actual web-based
33.52,5.6,tps on the flip side a non-web-based tps
36.88,4.48,means that the database file is stored
39.12,4.32,locally on the system or more so
41.36,4.96,accessed through a local area network
43.44,3.599,to a specific server so it can be on a
46.32,2.96,network
47.039,3.36,just the network is not on the internet
49.28,2.64,to connect to that server
50.399,4.32,you've got to have some sort of land set
51.92,4.639,up with wired or wireless mediums
54.719,3.601,and hardware set up to connect you to
56.559,2.881,that server so it's more of a private
58.32,2.8,network
59.44,3.919,so if we look at this visually on the
61.12,3.6,web-based side we have our computer
63.359,2.721,we need to connect the internet and
64.72,2.16,through the internet we can connect to a
66.08,2.96,server
66.88,3.2,whereas with the non-web-based tps i've
69.04,2.64,got my system
70.08,4.0,and it connects to the server through
71.68,3.759,the network makeup that i'm using
74.08,3.2,so let's look at the advantages and
75.439,2.72,disadvantages of web-based and look the
77.28,2.72,big advantage
78.159,3.441,of this is the systems database can be
80.0,3.04,accessed from all over the world
81.6,2.72,through the internet and this is great
83.04,2.24,if you've got a commercial business that
84.32,2.159,you're working with
85.28,3.36,because you could have customers all
86.479,3.921,over the world accessing a site signing
88.64,3.119,up to it and entering their own details
90.4,2.0,in order to become a part of your
91.759,2.0,service
92.4,3.52,and they can all do that through the
93.759,3.601,internet and you're going to see
95.92,2.559,access is everything really with the
97.36,2.079,difference between web-based and
98.479,2.241,non-web-based because on the
99.439,3.601,disadvantaged side of things
100.72,3.84,it's prone to a higher security risk due
103.04,3.359,to the internet technologies you've got
104.56,3.44,more entry points through the internet
106.399,3.521,for hackers to get into the system so
108.0,4.479,that's a disadvantage of it there
109.92,4.96,also access is dependent on the internet
112.479,3.121,being online so if the internet does go
114.88,2.64,down
115.6,3.119,we can't access the actual network if
117.52,2.72,we're working from
118.719,3.521,home or whatever especially if i'm a
120.24,3.28,participant of this system and i need to
122.24,3.04,use the internet to get through to it in
123.52,3.12,order to do my work for the company i'm
125.28,3.119,with
126.64,3.36,on the flip side for the non-web-based
128.399,2.56,tps the advantages are the higher
130.0,3.36,security
130.959,3.201,due to the limited access to the actual
133.36,2.56,server
134.16,3.84,okay because it is within a private
135.92,3.84,network there is more control there
138.0,4.64,of course there's always ways to get in
139.76,4.72,but it doesn't have a global access as
142.64,3.36,is the case with a web-based tps
144.48,3.36,which works to its favor in relation to
146.0,3.2,security okay but then on the
147.84,2.96,disadvantaged side of things
149.2,3.52,you need to be within the side of the
150.8,2.64,network in order to access the actual
152.72,2.159,system
153.44,4.159,alright so you've got to be within that
154.879,4.08,lan okay or a private when in order to
157.599,3.041,get into that system
158.959,3.36,okay in order to access the server you
160.64,3.92,can't be accessing it from home
162.319,3.28,because at home you are not near the
164.56,3.2,place of works
165.599,3.681,system so it's not possible there so i
167.76,2.24,hope this gives you just an idea of the
169.28,3.36,differences between
170.0,4.879,the two types of categories of web-based
172.64,4.16,and non-web-based tps's and essentially
174.879,3.28,it all comes down to the internet
176.8,3.359,one you can use the internet to get into
178.159,5.36,the system the other it's more likely a
180.159,3.36,private network
