2.621,1.53,All right.
4.151,2.112,Good afternoon.
6.263,2.003,"Come on, guys."
8.266,1.019,I need some energy.
9.285,2.44,I know this is before the break.
11.725,2.731,All right.
14.456,1.566,Much better. Much better.
16.022,2.804,"Hope you're having a great time
here."
18.826,3.35,This summit.
22.249,2.731,"Yes, yes,"
24.98,0.765,"yes, you are."
25.745,1.784,I know you are.
27.529,3.896,"Anyway, you've heard that we have launched"
31.498,3.023,"the era of quantum utility, right?"
34.521,4.114,"So in addition to bringing useful quantum
computing to the world,"
38.745,4.078,"we are committed to, focused on,
and have also made"
42.823,3.896,"great progress
in making the world quantum safe."
46.792,4.552,"So what does making the world
quantum safe really mean?"
51.417,2.658,What it means is that we are going to work
54.075,4.334,"collaboratively
with our clients across industries"
58.481,2.695,and partners across the ecosystem
61.176,3.969,to chart a course for the development
65.291,6.045,"and deployment of quantum
technologies in a responsible manner."
71.409,0.473,What does
71.882,4.115,"then, therefore responsible
quantum computing mean?"
76.07,4.624,It is simply expressed as
80.767,2.549,having an intention
83.316,3.387,to develop and deploy
86.775,7.32,quantum technologies in the most
94.168,1.82,inclusive
95.988,3.86,"as well as accountable
and transparent manner."
99.921,4.297,"That's what responsible quantum computing
really means."
104.291,2.658,"Now, in order to guide us through this,"
106.949,2.986,we have come up with five principles
109.972,4.988,"that we wish apply to see
whether anyone is following"
115.07,2.221,responsible quantum computing or not.
117.291,4.552,The first is you choose your use cases in
121.843,4.333,"such a way that they do create
positive societal impact."
126.285,4.625,"The second: anticipate
potential side effects,"
130.91,3.095,"if you will, unanticipated side effects"
134.005,3.023,of even these positive use cases.
137.173,5.608,The third is represent the
142.854,5.207,"capabilities as well as the limitations
of quantum computing."
148.134,2.695,"In other words, don't overhype. Right?"
150.829,3.678,"And the fourth is
we want to be intentional"
154.507,4.406,"about being consistent and transparent
in making decisions."
158.986,4.333,"And finally,
we want to build an inclusive ecosystem"
163.574,4.224,"that represents
the diversity of the world at large."
167.871,0.619,All right.
168.49,2.84,"Now, while we believe
in these principles,"
171.33,2.476,"and we are committed to doing this,"
173.806,3.423,we fully recognize that others outside
177.229,4.152,may not be. One such classical case
181.49,1.639,where this may happen
183.129,5.535,"is with the application of quantum
computing to break encryption."
188.736,0.401,"Now, let"
189.137,2.986,"me double click into that
and talk a little bit more."
192.232,3.569,"As quantum technology advances,"
195.874,2.403,we find that
198.277,4.443,"the standard problem
of prime factorization,"
202.792,3.205,"which is what modern day
cryptography depends"
205.997,5.171,"upon, becomes a solvable problem
with a quantum computer."
211.277,3.204,"So when a cryptographically relevant
quantum"
214.481,3.314,"computer becomes available in the future,"
217.904,4.698,"one can apply Shor's algorithm
to solve the problem"
222.602,3.751,"of prime factorization
in a matter of hours."
226.425,4.662,"What that means is
there are two key things that it leads to."
231.159,4.152,One is that the cryptography
235.311,4.333,"that we rely on
for all our digital communications, right,"
239.717,3.35,"including the cell phone,
including the WhatsApp that you have"
243.14,2.549,"and text messages you send,"
245.689,4.661,"is all likely to be vulnerable
or even be broken."
250.459,3.751,"That is a reality
of the existential threat."
254.283,4.297,"The second is even more concerning,
if you will, in that"
258.58,3.35,"there is this notion of harvest
now and decrypt later."
262.003,3.131,What that means is bad actors
265.134,3.023,can exfiltrate data today
268.157,3.022,"with absolutely no means of decryption,"
271.252,3.022,but they'll sit on it for several years.
274.384,4.296,"And then when your quantum computer
of sufficient scale and capacity"
278.753,5.353,"available, they can apply that to decrypt
the data that they exfiltrated today."
284.179,3.896,"Both of these are problems
that need to be solved."
288.148,2.549,So what is being done to solve them?
290.697,1.639,"In 2016, NIST"
292.336,4.006,"announced a competition
inviting submission of algorithms"
296.596,4.443,"that cannot be broken by quantum computer
as well as classical computers."
301.112,3.787,"We submitted a set of algorithms
for that, along with others,"
304.899,3.86,"and there were 80 plus submissions.
Fast forward to last July."
308.832,3.423,"Four algorithms were selected around
which standards"
312.255,3.568,"are going to be built,
and three of them came from IBM."
315.896,1.238,We didn't stop there.
317.134,3.715,"We continue to come up with new algorithms
that are somewhat"
320.849,4.296,"special purpose
and submitted three more for consideration"
325.218,4.661,"called Oil
and Vinegar, Mayo and SQI Sign."
329.952,0.255,Right?
330.207,3.678,"So we have continued
our work in that progress."
333.958,3.423,"Now, while we have been doing this,"
337.49,1.93,the US Federal government
339.42,4.916,"and some key agencies have continued
to publish certain guidelines."
344.591,2.003,So NSA published the
346.594,4.406,CNSA 2.0 guidelines that called for
351.109,4.261,"national security agencies
to be quantum safe by 2034."
355.406,1.821,They laid out a very clear schedule
357.227,3.75,"as to when what needs to happen
in order to achieve that."
361.05,4.516,"The US President issued Executive Order
and national security memorandums"
365.748,6.117,"that called for government agencies
to become quantum safe and also asked them"
371.865,5.39,"to submit an annual inventory
of cryptography on an annual basis."
377.328,3.24,"Now, in anticipation of this
and responding to this,"
380.568,4.334,"we created a quantum safe roadmap
and also a set of technologies"
384.902,5.207,"to support our clients in their migration
or journey towards becoming quantum safe."
390.291,3.023,And we announced this in May of this year.
393.35,3.168,"Subsequently,
we also released a technology"
396.518,3.933,"capability
called IBM Quantum Safe Explorer."
400.524,0.874,I'll talk about that
401.398,3.714,"in a minute
and even show you a demonstration of that."
405.185,1.711,We released that in October.
406.896,4.188,"So we are working diligently
to provide technology capabilities"
411.302,4.188,"that will enable our clients
to not just to start this journey,"
415.636,2.731,"but continue this journey
and also maintain"
418.367,3.496,"the level of cryptography
on an ongoing basis."
421.935,3.933,"Right? Now, all of these have been done"
425.868,3.678,"not a backroom lab situation or scenario,"
429.619,4.078,"but in our work
with existing clients, right?"
433.77,3.496,"There are a number of clients here
who have been part"
437.266,3.896,"of our initial set of clients,
and I will call them"
441.344,3.351,"a couple of them, I would say, as
they move forward at the appropriate time."
444.767,3.241,"So the bottom line is, these were"
448.081,3.387,"capabilities and ideas
that were tested in the field"
451.686,6.118,"and our response of solutions
was that it was a reaction to that. Now,"
457.877,2.694,"earlier
I talked about working in collaboration"
460.571,3.787,"with industries and industry consortiums
and ecosystem partners."
464.358,2.04,"Right? Consisting with that,"
466.398,3.896,"in 2020 we announced the Open Quantum Safe
Consortium."
470.367,0.51,Right?
470.877,2.148,"We have been
an active participant of that."
473.025,1.275,"And it has it has,"
474.3,4.916,"you know, pushed the boundaries on open
quantum safe quite a bit."
479.325,3.969,"Next,
we are an active participant in the NCCoE,"
483.294,3.714,"as it's called, the National Cybersecurity
Center of Excellence."
487.081,4.625,"And we were also the first
to announce an industry"
491.706,5.753,"consortia in the telco space
called the Post Quantum Telco Network."
497.569,3.677,"And we announce that in collaboration
with GSMA and Vodafone."
501.465,2.731,"And a shout out to Luke Ibbetson
from Vodafone,"
504.196,2.877,"who is here
who has been a tremendous partner,"
507.073,2.877,"not just in driving this,
but in collaborating with us."
509.95,1.966,"Thank you, Luke."
512.025,0.292,And we
512.317,4.952,"are also a partner or a leader I should say
driving two of the four workgroups"
517.487,5.026,"in the Post Quantum Cryptography Coalition
led by MITRE."
522.585,3.241,"I also wish to share with you
that we are close to announcing"
526.045,4.224,"a couple of other consortiums
in the payment space with Nacha, in North"
530.269,6.3,"America and Emerging Payments Association
in the Australia Space."
536.751,4.697,"So we are expanding from telco into
financial services and payments as well."
541.667,4.479,"This is the industry play
that we have been sort of talking about."
546.219,3.277,"Now. I started with what is responsible
quantum"
549.496,4.187,"computing, called out
what the potential risky use cases"
553.683,3.46,"there is with respect to Shor's algorithm
being applied"
557.252,4.77,"and breaking cryptography and laid out
what has been done, you know,"
562.022,5.208,"in the last few years to get prepared
for addressing that challenge."
567.303,2.512,"Now to go a little bit deeper
into the specific"
569.815,4.843,"technologies that we have developed,
approaches and technologies"
574.731,1.457,that will help clients
576.188,3.969,"migrate through their journey
to becoming quantum safe."
580.23,1.784,"Now, again, all of this was"
582.014,3.751,"based on the work that we have done
over the past year or so, year"
585.765,4.151,"plus in a way with various clients,
and we learned a lot from that."
589.989,2.986,So we created a three stage approach.
593.157,4.188,"One of the common problems
that we saw first was that almost"
597.345,5.17,"all of the clients
didn't know comprehensively and completely"
602.625,4.151,"where all cryptography
is being used within their enterprise."
606.849,3.641,"I'm not talking fingers at anyone,
but I'm pointing out the reality that"
610.636,4.115,"keeping track of every little cryptography usage
within the enterprise"
615.006,4.406,"is not part of what people do now,
and they don't have a good handle on that."
619.667,3.459,"So discovery of cryptography
and creating that inventory"
623.126,3.569,"of where cryptography is being used
becomes a very important step."
626.913,1.311,And that is step one.
628.224,3.35,"And we have a tool called IBM Quantum Safe
Explorer"
631.756,2.986,that helps identify that or discover that.
634.815,4.151,"And as I indicated earlier, I will have
a demo of that for you shortly."
639.076,3.714,"The second stage is having discovered
what you have,"
642.826,3.314,you have to augment that with what other
646.213,2.622,"cryptography
that may exist that you observe"
648.835,3.532,"in the actual execution of the system,
in the network."
652.44,4.807,"So observe, it's about observing
the dynamic cryptography exchange"
657.429,3.423,"by looking at traffic
that goes across your network"
660.997,4.552,"and using that information
wisely to prioritize."
665.622,2.877,"What do you go after first
and how do you sequence"
668.499,3.969,"your operations of remediation
such that you are quite effective?"
672.686,2.44,"I talked about the harvest now
and decrypt later"
675.126,5.171,"problem. For example,
if you know what your critical assets are,"
680.37,1.893,"crown jewels, as they're called,"
682.263,3.46,"if you know what your crown jewels are,
you want to protect them first."
685.796,2.002,And that's prioritization.
687.798,3.278,"Plus, observe is also about observability"
691.149,3.35,"so that it is not a once and done
kind of a solution."
694.681,2.986,"But you can apply the capabilities
of observe"
697.849,3.823,"to really observe on an ongoing basis
so you can continue"
701.672,3.205,"to manage the problem
in real time as well."
704.95,2.986,"The tool that supports
that is IBM Quantum Safe"
707.936,4.588,"Advisor and I will show you
a short demo of that as well."
712.597,3.168,The last piece is around transformation.
715.874,6.518,"So having discovered and prioritized
the work that needs to be done,"
722.465,3.35,"how do you go about beginning
the transformation of your cryptography"
725.815,3.969,"in the application and infrastructure
to support what you need to do?"
729.857,2.367,That is what transformation is all about.
732.224,2.986,"And we have a tool
called Quantum Safe Remediator,"
735.283,4.516,"which is a collection of codified
best practices and patterns"
739.908,2.986,"that we have observed in the field
and recorded that"
742.894,3.787,"and that you can apply today
so you don't have to wait for standards"
746.681,4.26,"to be announced sometime
next year or published, I should say,"
751.16,2.986,"sometimes next year around
the four selected algorithms."
754.219,3.787,"You can begin that work today
to prevent yourself from being caught"
758.224,2.986,"in this harvest now, decrypt later issue."
761.465,3.751,"Now, earlier I talked about calling out
certain clients and thanking them."
765.289,2.512,Here is where I'd like to
767.874,2.731,"call out
the excellent support that we have had,"
770.605,5.499,"and we learned together in this exercise,
is Customs and Border Protection."
776.177,4.078,"They have been extremely supportive
and they actually exercise..."
780.255,3.824,"I know you know, CTO, Sunil and Doug"
784.079,3.058,"Mace are here in the audience
and the team is there."
787.137,1.603,So a shout out to you guys.
788.74,2.075,Thank you for your support.
790.815,2.986,"They exercise all three of these, right?"
793.801,3.496,"In a limited manner, of course,
but they have gained a lot from this."
797.479,1.202,So did we. Right.
798.681,3.896,"So this how we experiment in the field
as well as learn from that"
802.759,2.877,and begin to sharpen this product. Right.
805.636,3.314,So now let me move over
808.95,3.095,"and begin
to show you a demo of the Explorer"
812.264,11.834,as well as the Advisor.
824.171,2.986,"So I start off with the Explorer,"
827.266,0.874,and I indicated
828.14,3.569,"that the Explorer
is about discovering cryptography"
831.891,4.078,"and it discovers cryptography
and static code; it discovers cryptography"
835.969,4.261,"in your software programs
and some object code as well."
840.303,2.33,And it creates an inventory.
842.633,4.479,"And this inventory is created in the form
of a cryptographic building materials."
847.185,3.824,"It is a standard that we have created
that is going to be part of the detector"
851.009,1.82,on the X 1.6 version.
852.829,2.112,"And if I remember right,"
854.941,3.678,"and it's going to be published
as a standard for folks to use."
858.838,3.314,"So it's critical
that we create this inventory"
862.152,3.168,"in the standard form that others
and other tools can also consume."
865.575,3.641,"So what it does is it has three
modes of operation."
869.398,3.35,"One is a VS code developer view,"
872.785,3.932,"which is what I'm going to show
to illustrate the capability of this tool."
876.79,3.132,"The second is a command line
interface that you can use"
880.14,3.678,"because if you are a large enterprise,
you're not going to go have a developer"
883.818,2.039,"go through every single
one of the modules."
885.857,1.53,You want to run a batch program
887.387,3.241,"that points to the GitHub repository
and say, go rip through that,"
890.846,3.787,"find out all the cryptography
and create an inventory place."
894.706,3.86,"That's what the command line interface
really interface accomplishes."
898.785,4.515,"The third is, okay, I've done this now
how do I manage this on an ongoing basis"
903.409,4.916,"For that they provide an API interface
that you can integrate into your CICD pipeline"
908.544,3.787,"so that every time somebody does a commit,
an automatic scan occurs"
912.331,4.005,"and you have a report of what you need
to get from a cryptography standpoint."
916.519,3.058,"So it is not
just about discovering it once,"
919.577,3.387,"but also about managing it
on an ongoing basis."
923.182,2.877,"So simply, if I go and scan"
926.059,3.787,"this program called Fund Portfolio
Analysis,"
929.919,4.661,"you will see on the lower right
hand side some stats begin to appear."
934.653,9.359,"And let me make this window a little
bit so that you can see."
944.084,0.947,So now
945.031,8.485,it has completed the scan and
953.589,0.837,there you go.
954.426,2.877,It discovered 32 artifacts.
957.303,3.605,This program had both C++ and Java code.
960.908,3.35,"We currently support five languages
C, C++, Java,"
964.258,3.787,"Python, Dart,
and it can also scan jar files."
968.082,3.969,We are currently working on C# and
972.124,2.439,next in line is Node.js and ABAP.
974.563,3.788,"So you have the ability to add languages
at a regular basis"
978.351,1.675,depending on the client's need.
980.026,4.333,"So we discovered this number of artifacts
and let me just highlight"
984.468,1.675,"the ones in Java, right?"
986.143,2.986,"So you have seven a library
called Bouncy Castle"
989.239,4.151,"and 12 from another library
called CryptoUtils, right?"
993.535,1.566,This is what you discovered.
995.101,2.986,"You can go in and see what
where is this coming from?"
998.269,4.334,"All of a sudden you find that
there is code that pops up in the window"
1002.603,6.227,"above you and some red highlight appears
this is exactly the line"
1008.83,3.932,"where this cryptography
is used within that program."
1012.835,1.202,So we are able to pinpoint
1014.037,2.949,"down to the line
where this cryptography is being used."
1016.986,3.169,"So in case you need to know
more about that or you are looking"
1020.155,1.347,"for remediating it,"
1021.502,4.843,"you know, it's taking you directly
to the area where you need to focus on."
1026.418,0.983,"In addition,"
1027.401,5.025,"you can also go in and say,
I did talk about"
1032.499,4.297,"I did talk about C bomb
or an inventory being created."
1036.869,5.061,"And do you see that the C bomb
gets created here as a JSON file,"
1042.04,2.294,which is nothing but
1044.334,3.532,"a JSON expression
of what the inventory looks like."
1047.939,5.207,"So what we have done here is
we scanned a software program,"
1053.255,3.678,"identified all the cryptographic usage,
and there is a number of other stats"
1056.933,1.967,"that I am not showing
you and other features,"
1058.9,3.095,"but just to get the point across
that we have the ability"
1061.995,3.787,"to scan languages,
extract cryptographic usage, document"
1065.855,4.333,"it and create the inventory
which is required for the C-SAW"
1070.188,3.277,"in the organization
to get a comprehensive view"
1073.611,4.77,"of where our cryptography is being used.
That's what this accomplished."
1078.454,4.661,"Now, one thing
I'd like for you to remember is this"
1083.225,1.311,point I
1084.536,5.753,"called out about 12 different artifacts
that are being used in Java,"
1090.362,4.879,"sorry, 19 being used in Java and 12
coming from a library called CryptoUtils."
1095.46,4.879,"Okay, let's hang onto that thought
and then let me go back to this slide."
1100.449,4.224,"Can we go back to the slide
please, to talk about what Advisor is."
1104.746,2.949,So I talked about
1107.695,3.241,Explorer being the static view
1111.009,2.731,that complemented with the dynamic view
1113.74,4.297,"that comes from advisor
is what completes the picture."
1118.146,3.023,"So the comprehensive picture
comes from adding the static view"
1121.169,5.462,"and the dynamic view. Advisor
takes data from six different sources"
1126.704,4.333,"and puts them together in an intelligent
manner for you to draw insights out of."
1131.037,4.734,"The six sources are standard
network scanning information"
1135.771,4.442,"that you currently have from your network
monitoring tool, whether it be Nessus,"
1140.286,3.096,Tenable Nessus or Qualys or Rapid7
1143.564,3.605,"or whatever you know your network
scanning tool may generate."
1147.169,4.697,"So we know that the data that you know,
running across your network."
1152.012,4.624,"The second is your configuration
management database or CMDB database."
1156.709,2.986,The third is the asset database that you have
1159.695,3.35,"that calls out all the assets
that you have, including the endpoints."
1163.118,3.095,"And the fourth one
is the provisioning database."
1166.213,3.678,"So we know what's being provisioned
where. And two other sources,"
1169.891,4.443,"which are the C bomb file
from the scanning that we just completed"
1174.407,2.949,and additional metadata that this Explorer
1177.356,3.715,"tool creates about all the other goodies
that that I didn't show you."
1181.143,4.807,"So these six things put together is
what gives you a comprehensive view."
1186.023,3.824,"Now, what problem does this solve?
This solves the problem of a C-SAW"
1189.847,3.204,not having a comprehensive view
1193.124,4.916,"of what's happening in cryptography
across that enterprise. Now"
1198.04,9.54,"With that thought in mind,
let's switch over to the Advisor demo."
1207.653,5.39,Let me make this a little bit bigger.
1213.115,1.639,All right.
1214.754,3.751,Good enough for now.
1218.578,2.439,"Right away,
you have a dashboard where you can show"
1221.017,4.152,"your selected set of metrics
that you would like to track."
1225.278,3.022,"And that's
what is shown on the top, right?"
1228.3,1.421,So you see a number of metrics.
1229.721,4.77,"What is my cipher suite strength?
How many endpoints"
1234.491,3.568,"am I managing,
and what are the various TLS"
1238.132,2.877,"protocols that I'm running?
What version of them am I running"
1241.009,3.459,"and how many different libraries
are being used by my developers?"
1244.468,4.188,"All these are interesting things,
and this graph that is half visible"
1248.729,3.569,is about the cryptographic posture.
1252.407,4.224,"How many violations
did the enterprise encounter"
1256.777,3.86,"in the month of January,
February and March?"
1260.709,3.824,"So you see a significant drop month
after month after month."
1264.788,2.731,And the story here is that
1267.592,1.566,they started implementing
1269.158,3.896,"policies to manage cryptography
in the December-January time frame."
1273.163,2.695,"And slowly
you find that people are adopting it"
1275.858,3.496,following it and it is decreasing now
1279.426,4.844,"to a stage where you are now at a very
small number in the month of November."
1284.306,5.644,"So the idea is the CSAW has a view of
what's happening across the enterprise,"
1290.169,3.459,can create policies that will help address
1293.737,2.95,the hot areas that they want to address.
1296.687,4.443,"One of them could be I don't want any more
use of TLS 1.0 or 1.1,"
1301.239,3.314,"or they may say, Here
are the set of libraries that are allowed."
1304.589,4.006,"Any other usage need should not be
permitted, so on and so forth."
1308.704,2.84,"And on that point,
I do want to call out that this fund"
1311.544,3.824,"portfolio analysis application
that we just scanned appears"
1315.368,3.641,"here in a compliance violation
for applications."
1319.118,5.463,"If we drill down and look at that,
you'll find that there are 12 instances"
1324.581,4.697,"occurring and these are the 12 instances
that we saw in the CryptoUtils"
1329.497,5.207,"that Explorer called out
saying there are seven from Bouncy Castle"
1334.704,1.784,12 from CryptoUtils
1336.488,3.86,"and the policy states that Bouncy
Castle is the recommended library."
1340.421,3.496,"The crypto is that the used is not
therefore it is trapped"
1343.917,1.493,as an exception here.
1345.41,3.496,"And not only that
you can take action on it and say"
1348.906,4.406,"go create a ticket
and send it to the ticketing system"
1353.385,1.675,and make sure that
1355.06,5.17,we are able to manage that in real time.
1360.34,2.039,Real life demo.
1362.379,2.877,As you see
1365.256,2.658,"anyway,
you'll be able to create the ticket"
1367.914,2.986,and send it to the user and
1370.9,2.513,"they can be
they can take care of handling that."
1373.413,2.075,So the bottom line is Advisor
1375.488,3.569,"gives you the dynamic view and together
you have a comprehensive"
1379.057,3.059,"view of what's been happening in the
in the enterprise."
1382.298,3.277,"Now, we didn't do this"
1385.648,0.91,in isolation.
1386.558,3.168,"We did that,
you know, working over the past year"
1389.836,4.26,"with a dozen clients in six
or plus in six or seven industries."
1394.205,4.261,"And these and these clients,
as I called out CBP,"
1398.684,3.642,we delivered tangible quantum safe solutions
1402.399,4.624,"across going across to discover,
observe and transform stages."
1407.096,1.347,That's what this is about.
1408.443,4.443,"Now, talking of
clients, I'd like to invite"
1412.959,3.022,for the next session here.
1416.163,1.748,This is a client panel discussion
1417.911,3.969,"session,
and leading off that discussion is"
1421.953,4.953,"the IBM Quantum Safe public sector leader
Charles Robinson."
1427.088,6.773,Charles.
1433.934,6.481,Thank you.
1440.488,1.821,Good afternoon.
1442.309,5.134,"My name is Charles
Robinson and I work for the IBM team."
1447.516,3.023,And I've spent 30 years
1450.648,3.605,"working in the intelligence community
and in DOD,"
1454.326,4.37,"in the national security community,
and we have a treat today."
1458.768,3.023,We're privileged to have
1461.864,4.114,a gentleman who spent most of his career
1466.088,2.731,"working for one of the largest
telecommunications"
1468.819,3.022,companies in the world.
1471.841,2.986,"And I want to introduce to you today,"
1474.864,5.134,Brian Miles.
1479.998,4.698,Brian.
1484.805,0.983,"Hey, Charles."
1485.788,2.913,"Hi, Brian. How are you? Good."
1488.701,3.314,So I prepared some questions for you.
1492.088,2.986,And I want to start with
1495.219,2.185,something fairly simple.
1497.404,2.367,Okay.
1499.771,3.496,Introduce yourself in your role at AT&T.
1503.376,2.039,Yeah. So my name's Brian Miles.
1505.415,3.715,"I worked at AT&T
for a couple of decades now."
1509.203,4.224,"I've been in cybersecurity
for about six years and"
1513.5,1.128,I spent about five years
1514.628,4.953,"working on the quantum security aspects,
trying to learn quantum."
1519.654,4.479,"And really that started off as a little
like kind of almost a little side project."
1524.205,5.135,"And the last couple of years
I've been working on that full time now,"
1529.413,1.529,and I'm leading the crypto agility
1530.942,3.642,and crypto inventory efforts within AT&T.
1534.656,1.056,Awesome.
1535.712,3.897,"So what does it mean for AT&T
to be committed to"
1539.682,2.949,"security innovation
alongside the technology progress?"
1542.631,4.734,"And how does quantum safe
figure into that responsibility?"
1547.438,2.403,"Yeah, so"
1549.841,1.348,there's a
1551.189,3.495,"as far as commitment,
I see commitment starting to show up,"
1554.794,2.986,"I think across a lot of companies
a lot of enterprises,"
1557.889,2.294,"especially ones
with critical infrastructure."
1560.183,3.496,"The federal government
has issued a number of memorandums"
1563.679,3.022,"and joint statements
and some other guidance."
1566.774,2.331,That's I think helping with that.
1569.105,2.694,"For example, the NSA, CISA"
1571.799,3.897,"and NIST
just published some joint guidance on"
1575.768,5.244,"quantum readiness and kind of the path
or the steps you need to take"
1581.085,4.261,"for your your migration to post quantum
cryptography."
1585.418,0.765,Outstanding.
1586.183,4.188,"I know we have some individuals
in the audience from CISA,"
1590.444,3.641,"and so we appreciate
you guys getting the word out."
1594.158,2.549,"What led you to start
your journey in quantum"
1596.707,3.022,safe cryptography now?
1599.948,3.678,"Yeah, so there's a number of reasons."
1603.698,1.348,It's going to take many years.
1605.046,1.238,This is a huge problem.
1606.284,2.513,"There's going to be it's
just going to take a lot of work."
1608.797,1.747,So it's going to take a long time.
1610.544,4.589,"If you just look at SHA-1 as an example
you know, that was an algorithm"
1615.133,3.022,"known to be vulnerable for a long time
and it took over a decade."
1618.228,3.605,"And for that to finally get deprecated
and kind of worked out of common use."
1621.906,4.187,So that's definitely one big reason.
1626.166,1.712,It's also going to take a village.
1627.878,3.204,"You know, it's not a small team within
a company is going to be able to do this."
1631.082,3.824,"You know, it's going to affect a lot of,
you know, your network infrastructure,"
1635.015,2.804,"your your applications
if you have IoT devices."
1637.819,2.076,"I mean, there's
a lot of different things to consider."
1639.895,4.297,"So it's going to take involvement
from a lot of people across enterprise."
1644.264,1.421,So that's going to take some time.
1645.685,3.641,"That's also a reason to get started, now."
1649.399,1.638,It's getting costly.
1651.037,2.549,So some recent reports somewhere
1653.586,3.788,"in the neighborhood of $170, $180"
1657.446,4.115,is the cost per record breached.
1661.634,1.712,"You know, that in itself
doesn't sound like much."
1663.346,0.691,And I'll start multiplying
1664.037,4.079,"that by the millions of potential records
that could be breached by a"
1668.225,2.221,"cryptographically relevant
quantum computer,"
1670.446,3.751,and that starts to become a big number.
1674.27,0.328,We don't
1674.598,3.787,"know exactly when it's going to manifest
itself."
1678.458,1.238,"You know, what's the timeline?"
1679.696,1.93,"Is it five years out, you know, this"
1681.626,3.714,"cryptography relevant on quantum computer
or is it 15 years out or 10 years out."
1685.34,2.331,"You know, we just don't really know."
1687.671,2.184,"There's a lot of indications
suggesting that maybe,"
1689.855,2.44,"you know, more in the 5 to 10 year range,
but we don't really know."
1692.295,2.768,But that's another reason to start now.
1695.063,4.151,"And then finally, the whole harvest
now decrypt later problem."
1699.287,1.893,"You know, that's the first quantum attack."
1701.18,1.457,It's a two part attack.
1702.637,2.513,"That first is happening now
and it's been happening."
1705.15,3.75,"At least there are some indications it's been happening
for a number of years now."
1708.973,2.513,"So it's it's not all
data has a shelf life."
1711.486,3.896,"It's very important
to start securing the more sensitive data"
1715.382,4.588,"and the data with the long shelf
life sooner versus later."
1720.043,3.095,"Outstanding. And I agree,"
1723.248,0.91,"you know,"
1724.158,3.387,"it's best to start now sooner
rather than later."
1727.654,5.28,"So what opportunities do you see
in terms of cybersecurity modernization,"
1733.007,4.369,"cryptographic agility
in crypto, bill of materials, etc.,"
1737.376,3.824,that AT&T is planning for and ultimately
1741.309,3.969,"executing on quantum safe
they're trying to transition?"
1745.351,0.364,Yeah.
1745.715,4.407,"So as far as opportunities, one
I guess right off the top,"
1750.194,3.605,"the opportunity to transform a,"
1753.872,2.913,"you know, cybersecurity infrastructure is,"
1756.785,2.003,"you know, it's decades old at this point."
1758.788,3.715,"We've kind of kept adding to it
and adding more features and"
1762.575,1.202,different types of security to it.
1763.777,3.459,"But, you know, original concept is decades
old at this point."
1767.236,2.331,So that's definitely an opportunity.
1769.567,5.681,"Quantum is providing that impetus
to make those changes."
1775.32,1.566,Having a good visibility
1776.886,4.843,"of your crypto
estate is another key point."
1781.839,2.622,"You know, putting this the C bomb
or the cryptographic"
1784.461,5.389,"inventory in place
and just getting a good visibility into"
1789.923,3.35,"where
all your cryptography is at, who owns it."
1793.346,3.313,"And you know what exact cryptography is
being used across"
1796.696,1.821,an enterprise is a big thing.
1798.517,4.442,"And you quantum
is providing an opportunity for that."
1803.032,5.098,"There's been a lot of work towards looking
more at risk and risk quantification,"
1808.239,1.275,"I think around business general,"
1809.514,3.896,"but specifically around quantum
I've seen here lately."
1813.519,4.734,"So being able to use
a risk centric approach to prioritize"
1818.326,3.532,"your work efforts, I think that's another"
1821.931,4.079,"opportunity
that's coming out of this whole"
1826.082,1.566,program or problem.
1827.648,4.115,"So I wanted to ask you,
how do you see AT&T"
1831.763,6.3,"and the entire industry making progress
in this space in the coming years?"
1838.136,0.728,"So, you"
1838.864,3.751,"know, those opportunities,
Of course, crypto inventory is a big one."
1842.688,2.439,I see a lot of
1845.127,3.751,"security solutions
that are starting to emerge."
1848.951,4.297,"There's a lot of vendors out there and
there's some you know, there's a number of"
1853.357,3.86,"different technologies that are starting
to kind of bubble up as being,"
1857.29,2.075,"you know, getting to the point
of being commercially viable."
1859.365,3.023,"So those are good things,"
1862.57,3.459,"you know, the opportunity
to build crypto agility"
1866.102,5.098,"into the our I.T infrastructure,
that's a big, you know, big deal."
1871.273,3.022,"I think that, you know,
one of the things I think comes out of"
1874.295,3.97,"that is not only
from a security perspective, but"
1878.374,3.933,"we've seen a lot of companies
carry this technical debt"
1882.379,2.95,"just over the years of
just not having the I.T."
1885.329,1.639,"budgets
to deal with some things that you know,"
1886.968,3.86,"maybe some older
systems in that. So I think"
1890.9,2.732,this presents some great opportunities
1893.632,1.529,"to get rid of some of the technical debt,"
1895.161,2.185,"you know, retire
some of that older technical debt"
1897.346,3.095,"and hopefully crypto agility
and having that agility in place"
1900.441,4.261,"and automation helps minimize
future technical debt."
1904.774,3.205,"I love that concept of
technical debt."
1908.052,3.496,"Most of the systems that we use in
this country"
1911.62,2.914,has been layered upon for many years.
1914.534,3.35,"And so this is an inflection
point opportunity"
1917.956,2.841,"to change the security posture
of those systems."
1920.797,1.675,I love that concept.
1922.472,5.426,"So finally, I want to ask you,
what advice do you have for others"
1927.97,5.062,"who are starting to think about their own
quantum safe readiness and"
1933.105,2.84,transformation plans?
1935.945,6.482,"Yeah, So just I think one of the things
that helped, frankly, helped us,"
1942.5,2.658,"I guess, get a good foothold is awareness."
1945.158,4.151,"I think just awareness across
an enterprise is a big thing."
1949.382,2.695,"There's starting to be some awareness, but"
1952.077,2.767,"just, you know, a lot of companies
I talked to a lot of different people."
1954.844,3.132,"It seems like awareness is still lacking
and a lot, a lot of ways."
1957.976,1.202,"I mean, obviously here we're good,"
1959.178,3.241,"but you get outside of this room
and there just isn't awareness."
1962.419,0.546,There needs to be.
1962.965,3.095,"So I think awareness is a key thing
and that's not just of leadership."
1966.06,4.188,"You know, it's also different stakeholders
within the enterprise, you know, people"
1970.284,3.824,"over different business units and things
like that, and also the workforce."
1974.144,1.165,"You know, it's going to take a village."
1975.309,3.824,"So making sure your workforce
is up to speed understands what's coming"
1979.133,2.695,"and why it's coming.
I think those are all things."
1981.828,4.952,"And, you know, one of the benefits that
can come out of just awareness alone is"
1986.853,3.569,as just in the normal cycle of things.
1990.494,2.294,These tech refresh cycles
1992.788,2.149,have an awareness across the company.
1994.937,3.933,"You know, maybe somebody says,
I got to replace this platform over here."
1998.979,4.37,"I should look at a quantum, you know,
secure or a quantum safe replacement."
2003.349,1.238,As I work to upgrade that.
2004.587,4.115,So I think those are all good things.
2008.774,2.622,"Mitigation, strategy and having a roadmap,"
2011.396,4.771,"the mitigation strategy
being more of the kind of,"
2016.239,3.569,"I guess, the North Star kind
of having here's where we're at today,"
2019.808,3.241,"here's what we want to get to, can use
that as your guiding North Star"
2023.085,4.37,"to make sure you're focused
on the right things."
2027.528,0.947,And then the roadmap.
2028.475,2.767,"You know, this is going to be spread out
over a number of years."
2031.242,2.294,"It's going to take a long time
to make all these changes."
2033.536,4.152,"So just mapping it out year by year,
kind of having a good roadmap"
2037.797,5.389,"where you go and as we saw with
IBM earlier today. And then"
2043.259,2.112,"the C bomb,
you know, we talked about the inventory"
2045.371,3.678,in the crypto bill of materials.
2049.122,1.42,"If you don't know who owns it,"
2050.542,3.751,"what cryptography is being used
and where it's at, you know, it really"
2054.366,3.932,"it limits your ability to really move
forward in a post quantum world."
2058.298,2.477,So that's absolutely paramount.
2060.775,4.151,"And then finally, supply chain."
2065.035,1.602,"You know, there's"
2066.637,2.622,"I think pretty much all companies
have a lot of suppliers, right?"
2069.259,4.552,"So if you're not working to secure
your supply chain, you kind of miss it."
2073.811,4.297,"You know, that's a big segment of your
security profile, security posture."
2078.181,2.986,"So I think it's really, really important
to start having the conversation"
2081.167,2.767,"with your suppliers
and ask you'll just ask, you know,"
2083.934,3.241,"to see their quantum roadmap
to give you some visibility"
2087.175,4.698,"as to whether they're prepared
or not prepared kind of thing."
2091.945,1.894,"Yeah, Ray mentioned"
2093.839,3.022,that we work with many clients
2097.08,4.115,from a quantum safe perspective and
2101.304,1.894,we're appreciative
2103.198,4.479,"to have the kinds of partnerships
that can make the impact."
2107.677,3.532,"And I want to thank you, Brian,
for working with us"
2111.209,3.496,and we really appreciate
2114.777,2.404,the partnership with IBM and AT&T
2117.181,3.022,over the years. Brian Miles.
2120.24,4.733,Thanks. So
2125.046,1.42,so I'll close.
2126.466,6.519,"and I want to thank Ray Harihankar
for that illuminating technology"
2132.985,5.243,"brief on the quantum safe
technology capabilities."
2138.301,2.294,The one thing I will share with you
2140.595,4.152,is a concept that my colleague John
2144.819,3.241,"Buselli has often said to me,"
2148.17,5.316,"and that is don't panic, just plan."
2153.595,5.353,"Although there may be a complex,
transformational journey"
2159.058,2.876,"coming down the path,"
2161.934,1.894,you have partnerships
2163.828,3.022,and capabilities that can help.
2167.069,2.476,"And with that,
I just want to thank you for your time."
