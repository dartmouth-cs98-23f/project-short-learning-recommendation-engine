Hello and welcome to our video on NoSQL databases!
What is a NoSQL database?
NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL."  
It refers to a class of database management 
systems that do not use the traditional SQL  
relational database model. Instead, NoSQL 
databases use a variety of different  
models for storing and retrieving data, such as 
key-value pairs, documents, or graph structures.
Brief history of NoSQL databases
NoSQL databases have been around for about two  
decades, but they have gained popularity in recent 
years due to the explosion of data being collected  
and stored by businesses and organizations. NoSQL 
databases are often used in situations where the  
data being stored is too large or complex to be 
easily managed with a traditional SQL database.
NoSQL database features
NoSQL databases are highly  
flexible and can handle a wide variety of data 
types and structures. They are also often designed  
for horizontal scalability, which means that 
they can easily handle a large volume of data by  
adding more servers to the database cluster. Some 
NoSQL databases offer features such as automatic  
sharding and replication, which can improve the 
performance and reliability of the database.
Types of NoSQL databases
There are several different  
types of NoSQL databases, including key-value 
stores, document databases, and graph databases.  
Key-value stores are designed to store data as 
a simple key-value pair, with the key being used  
to retrieve the value. Document databases store 
data as documents, which can contain complex data  
structures. Graph databases are used to store 
and query data that has complex relationships.
When should NoSQL be used?
NoSQL databases are well-suited for  
use in applications with a large volume of data 
or a high number of users. They are also often  
used in web applications, where they can help 
to improve performance and scalability. However,  
NoSQL databases may not be the best choice for 
all situations, and it is important to carefully  
consider the specific needs of your application 
before deciding which type of database to use.
