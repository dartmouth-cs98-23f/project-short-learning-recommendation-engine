0.64,4.24,hello everyone welcome again in this
3.28,4.4,software testing tutorial
4.88,4.16,we are going to understand what is
7.68,4.4,software testing
9.04,5.12,now this is very very important question
12.08,3.2,when you go for any interview in
14.16,3.68,software testing
15.28,3.68,or even if you are trying to learn
17.84,3.519,software testing and
18.96,3.2,get into software testing job you need
21.359,2.721,to understand
22.16,3.039,basically what is software testing
24.08,4.0,before you can learn
25.199,3.521,any other concepts all right so first
28.08,2.959,thing
28.72,3.44,we need to understand what is software
31.039,3.841,testing
32.16,4.72,watch this video till end so that you do
34.88,3.839,not miss any of the key concepts that
36.88,2.96,i'm going to explain in this particular
38.719,3.441,tutorial
39.84,3.84,before we understand software testing
42.16,4.879,let's first understand
43.68,5.12,what is testing in general sense say for
47.039,3.52,example you go into the market you buy
48.8,4.239,any product
50.559,3.041,you take it back home as soon as say for
53.039,2.801,example
53.6,3.439,it is an electronic appliance or any
55.84,4.399,kitchen appliance
57.039,6.401,you plug it in and it you know
60.239,6.001,it doesn't work it doesn't turn on it
63.44,4.32,or if it turns on it it doesn't function
66.24,3.68,properly
67.76,4.32,what is your feeling in that particular
69.92,3.36,case you are really annoyed or we get
72.08,4.399,really annoyed
73.28,4.879,with the company or the product uh
76.479,3.28,you know the company that has provided
78.159,5.041,that product and
79.759,4.241,we question the quality assurance or the
83.2,3.919,quality
84.0,6.32,criteria that that company has
87.119,5.841,for their product line right now how do
90.32,5.36,the companies ensure that they are
92.96,3.199,delivering the quality product it is
95.68,3.119,through
96.159,3.361,the testing right so it doesn't matter
98.799,2.721,whether you
99.52,3.84,you are buying a car you are buying any
101.52,5.68,electronic appliances or anything
103.36,6.24,else there is always a level of testing
107.2,5.279,involved in any of the product that
109.6,3.6,goes into the market that you buy all
112.479,3.92,right
113.2,4.959,so even if you are you know
116.399,3.68,taking any of the services say for
118.159,4.801,example you are you know
120.079,4.801,opting for any services you also
122.96,4.0,consider the quality of the service
124.88,4.48,right how the customer services
126.96,3.84,so quality is everywhere whether it's a
129.36,3.68,service or product
130.8,3.2,now when it comes to products it is
133.04,4.4,basically
134.0,7.36,ensured through a defined a predefined
137.44,5.519,process of testing so that is in general
141.36,3.519,what testing is
142.959,3.761,if we talk about the product or any
144.879,3.601,other you know like industries
146.72,3.2,car manufacturing electronic
148.48,3.839,manufacturing etc
149.92,4.48,so they have their own defined processes
152.319,4.56,and tools to ensure
154.4,3.76,that the products that are coming out of
156.879,3.921,the assembly line
158.16,3.76,are being tested properly and work
160.8,3.2,properly before
161.92,5.28,they are you know brought into the
164.0,6.56,market and being sold to the consumers
167.2,6.399,and they use it right now when we
170.56,5.52,correlate that to software
173.599,4.081,when you test the software it becomes a
176.08,4.239,software testing
177.68,4.32,so what exactly software software is any
180.319,4.801,application say for example
182.0,5.12,any website you take any application uh
185.12,3.199,which which has complex functionality
187.12,3.52,around you know
188.319,4.081,front and back and web services so any
190.64,5.44,application which
192.4,6.24,fulfills the business logic is
196.08,4.0,sort of software if it is you know like
198.64,4.56,a mobile app
200.08,5.519,um or any other application that is
203.2,6.0,available out there over the internet
205.599,7.441,right so these sort of applications
209.2,4.24,are known as software so softwares are
213.04,2.4,built
213.44,3.359,into you know using many different
215.44,4.719,programming languages
216.799,4.881,for example like cc plus plus java there
220.159,2.64,are n number of programming languages
221.68,2.96,that can be used
222.799,3.44,now you have mobile devices where you
224.64,4.56,have apps so these are
226.239,4.241,all software when you are testing these
229.2,4.239,softwares
230.48,5.039,it is known as software testing now
233.439,2.961,software testing is not a standalone
235.519,3.761,activity
236.4,4.16,it's a predefined process that you need
239.28,4.159,to follow
240.56,3.599,from step by step and ensure that the
243.439,5.44,particular
244.159,8.08,product that you are trying to you know
248.879,4.56,put it to the market or say for example
252.239,3.28,an app you want to
253.439,3.76,install or you want to launch it into
255.519,3.84,the app store
257.199,4.641,prior to launching the app you want to
259.359,4.881,ensure that whatever functionality
261.84,3.76,that particular app needs to provide to
264.24,4.64,the customers
265.6,4.24,it works as expected i'll take an
268.88,3.84,example of
269.84,5.919,the app say for example whatsapp okay
272.72,3.039,very widely used
277.919,3.201,so say for example you are building
279.52,2.48,something similar or you are you are
281.12,3.6,creating something
282.0,3.6,similar to whatsapp so there will be
284.72,2.72,coding done
285.6,3.84,right so once the coding is done there
287.44,4.64,will be features added so for example
289.44,3.44,i should be able to you know send text
292.08,4.08,messages
292.88,5.84,to other people when i you know add them
296.16,4.16,in my contact list right when i add them
298.72,3.84,in the in the contact list
300.32,4.08,i should be able to call them so these
302.56,3.12,are you know like some of the features
304.4,3.92,that
305.68,4.4,in the whatsapp or the app scenario you
308.32,5.2,will basically
310.08,6.16,test before you actually say that yes
313.52,3.84,this functionality say functionality one
316.24,4.399,functionality two
317.36,5.679,is uh you know make call all right
320.639,3.521,so i should be able to make call i
323.039,6.481,should be able to
324.16,9.12,text to other person functionality three
329.52,3.76,add contacts right
333.6,6.24,and then functionality for say for
336.84,3.0,example
340.24,3.76,add profile picture
344.479,3.041,right at profile pic so these are some
347.039,4.16,of the
347.52,7.6,functionalities in this particular app
351.199,7.921,now this is the app now say for example
355.12,6.24,you want to test an e-commerce website
359.12,2.24,okay
362.8,6.16,so e-commerce website so what
366.08,3.76,functionalities that e-commerce website
368.96,3.359,will have
369.84,3.84,sorry about my handwriting um but this
372.319,4.561,is e-commerce website
373.68,7.04,so say for example functionality one is
376.88,7.039,you know add items add items
380.72,6.16,to cart then
383.919,2.961,functionality to
387.36,5.36,remove items right remove items if i
391.199,4.641,want to
392.72,3.12,from cart
396.96,3.519,okay so similarly there'll be you know
398.88,3.36,like different
400.479,3.361,so this is the example of the app this
402.24,2.72,is example of the website which will
403.84,3.68,have you know like
404.96,3.2,you know all different interfaces
407.52,3.84,built-in
408.16,4.4,integration built-in and then you as a
411.36,3.04,tester will follow a
412.56,3.52,defined process so you have this
414.4,2.88,requirement this functionality say for
416.08,3.519,example it will have
417.28,4.16,the requirement or it will come as a
419.599,4.801,user story if you are following scrum
421.44,3.36,methodology or agile agile approaches
424.4,3.04,then
424.8,4.08,you will basically go through those user
427.44,3.44,stories
428.88,3.12,and analyze the user stories write the
430.88,4.319,test cases to
432.0,4.0,ensure that these you know requirements
435.199,2.641,that are mentioned
436.0,4.4,say for example adding items into the
437.84,6.24,card you write test cases you will then
440.4,6.239,ensure that those test cases actually
444.08,4.48,work as expected right so you run the
446.639,4.56,website you launch the website
448.56,4.4,that is being built um and then you will
451.199,3.681,run those test cases what you will do is
452.96,3.359,you will add the items into the cart you
454.88,3.439,will try to add the items you will try
456.319,4.72,to remove the items from the card
458.319,4.561,and then proceed further so you'll say
461.039,2.321,yes these test cases have passed or
462.88,2.8,these
463.36,4.08,test cases have failed so if any of the
465.68,3.76,functionality doesn't work as
467.44,3.36,it is defined in the requirement you
469.44,5.199,will say it has
470.8,6.959,failed right so this is the overall
474.639,5.601,example or with example um
477.759,5.12,to explain you what exactly is software
480.24,5.679,testing it is not a standalone activity
482.879,6.32,it is a you know a life cycle
485.919,4.96,and it basically consists of um all the
489.199,2.481,static approaches and the dynamic
490.879,2.481,approaches so
491.68,3.519,there are a lot of activities that need
493.36,3.679,to be involved there say for example
495.199,3.921,once you get the requirement you analyze
497.039,2.961,those requirement as the testing team or
499.12,3.44,tester
500.0,3.599,and see whether there are any gaps into
502.56,4.16,those requirement
503.599,4.88,so that analysis is the static part when
506.72,3.599,you design your test cases you ensure
508.479,4.56,that all the coverage
510.319,4.321,for that particular requirement is there
513.039,4.401,for that particular
514.64,5.04,user story or the requirement all right
517.44,5.68,so that analysis
519.68,5.2,part is the static part when you execute
523.12,4.0,the code or when you run the code and
524.88,5.92,actually launch the website or actually
527.12,6.399,launch the whatsapp on ios or android
530.8,4.32,and then you know click on it or test or
533.519,3.76,follow different steps that's the
535.12,2.88,dynamic part of the software testing
537.279,3.281,right
538.0,4.399,so this is basically you know what
540.56,3.6,exactly software testing that's the
542.399,3.761,first part it is process it is it
544.16,5.2,consists of static and dynamic
546.16,6.32,testing the second thing is that
549.36,5.44,it is um meant to find
552.48,3.6,the defects prior to launching the
554.8,4.0,application right
556.08,4.24,before you launch any of the you know
558.8,5.52,app or application
560.32,8.88,to the customer software testing ensures
564.32,7.36,that your testing team is able to find
569.2,4.4,those errors well in advance before you
571.68,5.68,actually go into the production right
573.6,5.04,now 100 um defect removal or identifying
577.36,4.159,hundred percent defect
578.64,4.4,or making sure that your your product is
581.519,4.721,100 defect free
583.04,5.12,is not possible but yes still software
586.24,4.32,testing ensures that
588.16,3.04,most of the critical scenarios or the
590.56,3.279,basis
591.2,3.92,basic scenarios are still working the
593.839,3.12,edge scenarios
595.12,3.76,yes there could be possibility it is not
596.959,4.161,possible to test hundred percent
598.88,4.0,it is possible uh that there will be
601.12,3.2,still some you know production defects
602.88,3.199,and that's where that maintenance
604.32,4.88,testing comes into place
606.079,5.681,so this is a brief introduction and
609.2,3.84,correlation of software testing with any
611.76,3.519,other testing
613.04,3.84,into the market and with the you know
615.279,5.68,any of the application or
616.88,6.8,app that you test within the software
620.959,3.12,space so that's all for this tutorial
623.68,3.44,hope
624.079,4.641,i was able to clarify the question
627.12,3.279,what is software testing this is the
628.72,3.119,first and foremost
630.399,4.321,question if you're going for an
631.839,3.201,interview and our fresher or you know
634.72,2.72,like
635.04,3.52,new graduate you will be asked this
637.44,3.76,question so you need to
638.56,4.56,you need to know how you can correlate
641.2,4.639,it with the real life examples
643.12,4.959,and explain to the interviewer along
645.839,5.041,with you know
648.079,3.281,learning the overall software testing
650.88,3.28,from
651.36,4.0,here on so that's all for this tutorial
654.16,4.88,hope you like it
655.36,3.68,thank you very much for watching
