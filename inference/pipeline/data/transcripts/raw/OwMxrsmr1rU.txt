14.24,2.56,they do
15.2,3.44,i'm shaheen parks an innovation
16.8,3.84,strategist and i'm excited to be here
18.64,3.68,today with dr micah takeda who will be
20.64,2.799,discussing quantum error correction with
22.32,2.719,us
23.439,3.6,dr takita is a research staff member at
25.039,4.16,ibm quantum with expertise in
27.039,4.961,experimental quantum computation
29.199,5.2,she joined ibm in 2015 from princeton
32.0,4.399,university after completing her phd in
34.399,4.16,electrical engineering
36.399,4.16,dr taquita specializes in the control
38.559,4.281,characterization and benchmarking of
40.559,4.721,multi-qubit quantum
42.84,4.199,systems today michael will discuss her
45.28,3.2,work in taking quantum error correction
47.039,2.561,from theoretical to practical
48.48,2.399,application
49.6,3.279,she'll first give us a very quick
50.879,3.921,tutorial in what error correction means
52.879,3.761,in this context and then talk with us
54.8,3.759,about innovations on both the hardware
56.64,4.719,and software side that are enabling
58.559,3.84,practical experimentation
61.359,3.041,she'll then take us through some
62.399,4.481,experimental results and show us how
64.4,6.0,these relate to ibm's quantum roadmap
66.88,5.68,with that i'll hand it over to micah
70.4,4.48,thank you shaheen for introduction
72.56,5.28,today i will tell you about how to make
74.88,5.76,quantum error correction more practical
77.84,3.68,so here's an overview of my talk
80.64,3.76,first
81.52,5.36,why do we need quantum error correction
84.4,5.44,quantum systems are inherently noisy and
86.88,5.12,we need a way to deal with these noises
89.84,4.16,the way classical computers also use
92.0,3.6,some type of error correction i'll
94.0,3.439,discuss some similarities and
95.6,3.36,differences when working with quantum
97.439,3.601,systems
98.96,4.08,i will then introduce you to a popular
101.04,4.32,quantum era correction code a surface
103.04,4.96,code that is ideal for near-term to
105.36,5.439,realize with current hardware technology
108.0,4.88,and tell you more on the innovations ibm
110.799,4.561,has made in co-designing new heavy
112.88,4.32,hexagon code that is more practical when
115.36,4.24,building the hardware
117.2,4.08,the main focus of this talk will be on
119.6,4.32,the progress we have made in
121.28,4.72,superconducting qubits at ibm and recent
123.92,4.479,demonstration of the decos 2 error
126.0,6.4,detection code that we have done using
128.399,6.161,one of ibm's 27 qubit falcon processor
132.4,4.96,finally to wrap up the talk i'd like to
134.56,6.28,discuss how ibm quantum hardware roadmap
137.36,5.92,aligns with future work on quantum air
140.84,4.84,correction faulty quantum systems
143.28,5.92,require some type of error correction
145.68,5.919,but first what do i mean by faulty
149.2,4.319,quantum systems are inherently noisy and
151.599,3.441,easily influenced by environmental
153.519,3.681,fluctuation
155.04,4.24,some typical errors in quantum systems
157.2,5.119,are qubit decoherence
159.28,5.599,which is a loss of quantum information
162.319,4.721,so here is a blocked sphere representing
164.879,4.881,single qubit with zero state on the
167.04,5.6,north pole and one in the south pole
169.76,5.6,t1 relaxation time is decay from one to
172.64,4.48,zero state as you see here in a big blue
175.36,4.48,arrow
177.12,4.72,qubits only have zero and one state but
179.84,3.92,can also be in a superposition state
181.84,3.759,where phase of the state also carry
183.76,4.64,information
185.599,5.521,t5 dephasing time is randomization of
188.4,6.16,the phase phi as you see here in green
191.12,6.88,arrow and these two t1 and t5
194.56,6.56,contributes to t2 coherence times
198.0,5.599,both t1 relaxation time and t2 coherence
201.12,4.56,times have improved over the years
203.599,4.401,as you may have heard how recently we
205.68,5.68,have reached average of about 300
208.0,6.0,microsecond t1 and t2 on a large 27
211.36,4.72,cubic falcon processor
214.0,4.72,nonetheless this is still a large source
216.08,4.96,of air in our systems
218.72,3.68,other errors in the systems are gate
221.04,3.839,errors that could come from poor
222.4,5.119,calibration state preparation and
224.879,4.801,measurement errors crosstalk errors and
227.519,6.0,leakage errors that takes your qubit out
229.68,6.639,of the computational basis to name a few
233.519,4.72,so quantum systems are faulty and to
236.319,4.161,build a universal quantum computer to
238.239,4.321,solve large and complex problems
240.48,3.28,we will need some type of quantum error
242.56,2.879,question
243.76,4.24,so let's start from reviewing how
245.439,5.44,classical error correction works
248.0,6.239,in a classical system each physical bit
250.879,6.961,0n1 can be encoded into many zeros and
254.239,5.52,ones in this example seven copies
257.84,4.4,when there is some noise some of the
259.759,5.44,bits can flip from zero to one and one
262.24,6.399,to zero in this example the third and
265.199,5.521,the six bits in red have flipped but as
268.639,4.081,long as less than half of the copies
270.72,4.32,experience a bit flip you can look at
272.72,4.64,the bit string and simply do a majority
275.04,3.599,vote to decode back into the correct
277.36,3.52,state
278.639,4.081,here the code distance d
280.88,4.8,roughly indicates the amount of noise
282.72,6.8,tolerance and as you see here you can
285.68,6.079,expect a lower logical error pl as you
289.52,6.64,increase the distance d with some error
291.759,7.041,rate p which is between 0 to 1.
296.16,5.52,so that was classical error correction
298.8,5.04,now how about quantum error correction
301.68,4.16,can we do the same
303.84,3.919,similar to classical error correction
305.84,4.32,quantum error correction relies on
307.759,3.521,encoding dealing with some noise and
310.16,3.84,decoding
311.28,5.52,but key differences are that we can't
314.0,4.72,copy an unknown quantum state as proved
316.8,4.56,in no cloning theorem
318.72,5.919,but as you see in this example rather
321.36,7.119,than making a copy of psi you can encode
324.639,8.081,psi logical into a state like 0 0 0 plus
328.479,7.201,1 1 1 and use that as your logical qubit
332.72,5.199,another difference is that
335.68,3.84,when you measure a qubit it can destroy
337.919,3.361,entanglement
339.52,4.239,and end the computation
341.28,4.479,so to get around this we can use another
343.759,4.401,ancillar qubit that we use to measure a
345.759,4.961,parity of data qubits
348.16,4.72,so let's talk a bit more about parity
350.72,4.479,measurement next
352.88,4.48,the circuit shown here in the left
355.199,4.72,of the slide is a sample circuit that
357.36,3.52,will provide a parity of the two qubits
359.919,3.201,used
360.88,4.4,using a third on silicubit
363.12,4.32,and the left plot is to illustrate what
365.28,3.52,parity measurements are and the right
367.44,3.12,table
368.8,4.08,is an example where we can use the
370.56,4.479,parity to detect errors
372.88,4.64,parity of the bit string could be even
375.039,5.041,or odd and we can find this by measuring
377.52,4.56,the z z operator
380.08,4.48,zc parity measurements can have either
382.08,5.76,plus one or minus one eigenvalues which
384.56,5.759,corresponds to even or odd parity
387.84,4.639,in this circuit measuring zero on down
390.319,5.121,silicubit corresponds to plus one
392.479,5.761,eigenvalue or even state and measuring
395.44,4.96,one corresponds to minus one eigenvalue
398.24,4.48,or odd state
400.4,4.32,if you follow the colors here the zero
402.72,4.319,the white and the green input showed
404.72,5.199,zero zero and one one which have even
407.039,5.361,parities when you run this circuit and
409.919,4.961,probe using the third on silicubit what
412.4,4.88,you measure is zero that tells you that
414.88,4.0,it has an even parity
417.28,4.0,the red and the blue
418.88,4.24,one zero and zero one states have odd
421.28,3.68,parities which are confirmed when
423.12,4.079,running through this circuit that leads
424.96,5.679,to ancillar qubit being one which
427.199,5.761,corresponds to negative eigenvalue
430.639,4.721,using the circuit by projecting parity
432.96,4.32,onto the third on silicubit it allows
435.36,3.6,you to measure the parity of the input
437.28,3.759,qubits without destroying the
438.96,4.16,entanglement if present
441.039,4.481,so this looks like a good way to detect
443.12,4.799,bit flip errors
445.52,4.399,qubits unlike classical bits can have
447.919,4.881,face flip errors along with big flip
449.919,4.56,errors so let's consider an example
452.8,2.799,where you can detect both types of
454.479,3.761,errors
455.599,6.241,to the right is a toy model where a bell
458.24,7.2,state 0 0 plus 1 1 is our target state
461.84,6.24,by measuring both zz and xx operators
465.44,4.56,you can measure both types of errors
468.08,4.88,and you can simultaneously measure these
470.0,5.199,two operators since they commute
472.96,5.28,the target state without any error will
475.199,4.961,have plus one eigenvalue for both z z
478.24,4.32,and xx operators
480.16,3.52,but if you have a bit flip error an x
482.56,3.919,error
483.68,6.799,it will have minus one eigenvalue for zz
486.479,6.801,operator and plus one for xx operator
490.479,5.761,now with the phase flip error z air it
493.28,4.479,will be plus one for z z but minus one
496.24,4.0,for x x
497.759,5.201,and finally if you have both bit and
500.24,5.12,face flip air a y error
502.96,6.16,that will lead to -1 eigenvalues for
505.36,5.76,both zz and xx operators
509.12,4.24,my colleagues at ibm did an experimental
511.12,4.799,demonstration on this parity checks back
513.36,3.84,in 2015 using four superconducting
515.919,4.0,qubits
517.2,5.199,and note that this example stabilizes a
519.919,5.04,single state but does not protect a code
522.399,5.041,space to protect the logical qubit
524.959,4.88,so let's look at an example of how we
527.44,4.0,can encode a logical qubit and protect
529.839,4.401,it
531.44,4.64,surface code is a very popular code
534.24,3.84,where you only need to have nearest
536.08,3.6,neighboring coupling with relatively
538.08,3.36,high threshold
539.68,3.839,so i will get back to the concept of
541.44,3.68,threshold in a bit but let's look at the
543.519,3.841,layout first
545.12,4.719,this is a picture of decals 5 surface
547.36,3.84,code which can detect and correct any
549.839,3.201,two errors
551.2,3.04,and black qubits are called the data
553.04,3.44,qubits
554.24,4.56,and blue squares denote that the four
556.48,4.4,black data qubits on its corners are
558.8,4.159,checked for their bit parity and the
560.88,3.76,pink squares check for their phase
562.959,3.361,parity
564.64,3.68,you detect errors by running these
566.32,4.88,parity checks both bit and phase
568.32,4.959,parities over and over and based on the
571.2,4.079,outcome of the parity measurement we can
573.279,3.441,keep track of what errors happen on
575.279,3.441,which qubit
576.72,4.0,so i won't go into details on how
578.72,4.48,logical gates are implemented on this
580.72,6.4,code but we'll give you an example using
583.2,3.92,a smaller distance to code later on
587.2,3.68,so i mentioned
588.88,4.16,how one of the appeals of working with
590.88,3.519,surface code is that it has a relatively
593.04,3.6,high threshold
594.399,4.801,so what does that mean
596.64,4.56,here i have a simulation plot of logical
599.2,4.24,air at different distances
601.2,5.759,while you sweep the air of a physical
603.44,5.839,qubits you use to encode a logical qubit
606.959,4.161,so let's focus on the two curves the
609.279,4.721,black where it has smallest number of
611.12,5.44,qubits with smallest distance three and
614.0,4.959,the magenta curve with more qubits with
616.56,5.6,distance 13.
618.959,5.041,so when the physical air is high
622.16,4.32,above the threshold where it's shown in
624.0,4.959,purple line larger than the larger the
626.48,4.08,distance with more qubits result in
628.959,4.88,higher logical air
630.56,3.279,but below this purple line
634.079,4.561,at the low physical air as you increase
636.24,3.68,the distance you can get lower and lower
638.64,3.68,logical air
639.92,4.8,so you see the benefit in using more
642.32,5.84,qubits to encode a logical qubit if you
644.72,6.0,have low enough physical errors
648.16,4.0,the surface code is an attractive choice
650.72,4.239,especially for the superconducting
652.16,4.88,cubist community due to these properties
654.959,3.88,which is the reason ibm had followed the
657.04,5.12,path in building this lattice in the
658.839,5.641,past although what we had found was that
662.16,4.239,the surface code requiring four nearest
664.48,3.68,neighbors to run the parity checks are
666.399,4.961,difficult to make
668.16,5.119,so the main difficulties come from one
671.36,4.56,frequency crowding that leads to
673.279,4.8,collisions that make it harder or even
675.92,5.2,impossible to tune up gates
678.079,5.841,and two crosstalk because there are so
681.12,6.32,many qubits coupled to each one
683.92,5.44,so ibm has been developing larger and
687.44,4.24,larger superconducting qubit system in
689.36,4.0,the recent years but we have modified
691.68,3.599,the connectivity so that it is in a
693.36,4.159,heavy hexagon lattice
695.279,4.641,and in this lattice there are at most
697.519,4.56,three nearest neighbors on each cubits
699.92,4.64,and a lot of them the black and the
702.079,4.481,orange qubits in this picture only have
704.56,4.16,two nearest neighbors
706.56,4.0,this change in qubit layout increases
708.72,4.0,the yield of fabricating a
710.56,2.959,collision-free device
712.72,2.64,so
713.519,4.241,now we don't have the nice square
715.36,4.479,lattice that you can map surface code to
717.76,4.319,but the theorists from ibm came up with
719.839,4.881,the new hybrid code called the heavy
722.079,4.961,hexagon code that you can encode logical
724.72,3.52,qubits similarly to how it was done in
727.04,3.28,surface code
728.24,5.039,and the threshold for one type of error
730.32,6.88,is around point four five percent which
733.279,6.401,is not much lower than the surface code
737.2,4.4,so now that you have a bit of background
739.68,4.24,in quantum error correcting code i'm
741.6,5.039,going to start describing the details of
743.92,4.64,experimental demonstrations that is now
746.639,4.801,possible because of improvements in
748.56,4.64,coherence lower gate errors frequency
751.44,4.48,collision reduction due to the lattice
753.2,4.56,design and most importantly improvement
755.92,4.719,in measurement
757.76,5.519,this example code is called the 4-1-2
760.639,5.2,error detection code where you encode
763.279,6.0,one logical qubits into four physical
765.839,5.041,qubits which is a distance to code
769.279,4.641,since the arbitrary error you can
770.88,5.519,correct is d minus one over two which is
773.92,5.2,half this is not an error correcting
776.399,5.12,code but an error detecting code so in
779.12,5.04,this code we have four data qubits and
781.519,4.961,three ancilla qubits
784.16,5.2,similar color scheme as before pink
786.48,4.799,square denotes that the four orange data
789.36,4.24,qubits in its corner are checked for
791.279,5.601,their first parties using the pink on
793.6,5.52,silicubits and these two blue qubits are
796.88,4.079,also used as flat qubits for phase
799.12,4.32,parity checks
800.959,5.12,blue rectangles check for the bit parity
803.44,6.0,using the blue qubits again this time as
806.079,6.241,z parity and silicubits
809.44,6.16,this code can be mapped onto a section
812.32,6.0,of ibm's 27 qubit falcon processor
815.6,4.4,and the parity checks or the stabilizers
818.32,5.44,that we will measure are weight four
820.0,5.6,extracts and two weight two z-checks
823.76,2.96,logical gates and states are defined
825.6,3.2,here
826.72,3.359,and you can apply these logical gates to
828.8,2.64,the state
830.079,3.521,to the right
831.44,4.079,and in the surface code example i
833.6,4.72,mentioned how we repeat the parity
835.519,5.68,checks over and over to keep detecting
838.32,5.36,errors to do this we need to keep
841.199,5.681,measuring and reusing the ancilla qubits
843.68,5.92,as you run more and more parity checks
846.88,5.28,suncilla qubits are initialized each
849.6,4.88,time after the measurements and this is
852.16,4.96,done by applying a conditional reset
854.48,5.52,using fpga to determine the state of the
857.12,4.959,qubit and apply a bit flip depending on
860.0,4.0,the outcome of the measurement
862.079,5.2,this is a very difficult task when
864.0,6.639,trying to run very fast in similar times
867.279,5.68,as what your gates are running
870.639,4.64,the ibm team has designed a quantum
872.959,4.961,device that allows us to measure and
875.279,5.12,reset with high fidelity in less than
877.92,4.4,800 nanoseconds using state-of-the-art
880.399,4.481,control electronics
882.32,5.44,so how about other errors
884.88,5.04,this device has sub 1 percent error for
887.76,3.439,both two qubit and measurement reset
889.92,3.52,errors
891.199,4.32,in combining all the gates measurement
893.44,4.639,and reset times necessary to run these
895.519,6.161,parity checks the time it takes to run
898.079,6.161,one z check is around 1.7 microsecond
901.68,5.04,and extracts takes about 2.9
904.24,5.039,microseconds
906.72,4.64,in this slide you'll see an air plot
909.279,3.92,against time or rounds
911.36,3.52,and rounds are defined in the circuit
913.199,4.401,drawn in the right
914.88,4.399,where one pink region and one blue
917.6,3.2,corresponds to one round of error
919.279,3.201,detection
920.8,3.599,so earlier in the talk i discussed
922.48,5.52,several errors that can be present on a
924.399,6.321,quantum system here to compare how well
928.0,5.199,we can preserve our encoded state let's
930.72,4.72,first consider air that arises from t1
933.199,4.64,relaxation time
935.44,4.319,a qubit when prepared in one state
937.839,3.601,decays to zero state with average
939.759,3.52,lifetime t1
941.44,5.519,and seven qubits we use for this
943.279,6.081,experiment has t1 times ranging from 96
946.959,5.361,to 193 microseconds which is shown in
949.36,5.2,yellow lesion region in the plot
952.32,4.24,and longer you try keeping the qubit in
954.56,5.279,one state it is more likely for the
956.56,6.16,qubit to experience the bit flip error
959.839,5.12,now the distance two four one two code
962.72,4.64,encodes one logical qubits into four
964.959,3.921,physical qubits and as you see in the
967.36,3.68,circuit here
968.88,3.12,the first part is how we encode the
971.04,3.2,qubit
972.0,5.36,and pink part of the circuit is how you
974.24,5.44,detect phase errors and finally blue
977.36,4.88,checks for bit flip errors
979.68,5.44,after initializing the state you repeat
982.24,4.719,this pink and blue block n times that's
985.12,4.24,the number of round you see in the x
986.959,4.721,axis to the left
989.36,4.719,and finally measuring the data qubits to
991.68,3.76,set to see if the state of your
994.079,3.841,measurement
995.44,4.48,at the end is the same logical state as
997.92,4.24,what you have prepared
999.92,4.88,so in this circuit there are two types
1002.16,4.96,of air sensitive events one
1004.8,4.479,when there is an error on flat qubits
1007.12,4.48,and second when the two subsequent
1009.279,3.36,measurements of the same stabilizer are
1011.6,3.76,different
1012.639,5.281,and we post select if there's any in any
1015.36,2.56,air event
1018.16,4.88,here in blue i am plotting
1020.88,3.84,error after preparing a logical minus
1023.04,3.519,state and running the error detection
1024.72,3.04,circuit n times
1026.559,3.921,as you see
1027.76,5.76,encoding logical qubit air is much lower
1030.48,5.68,than the air from physical qubit t1
1033.52,5.36,and when you zoom in and fit to a model
1036.16,6.879,we can obtain lifetime tau which is
1038.88,6.64,around 980 rounds at 986 rounds
1043.039,4.481,and this corresponds to about 4.5
1045.52,4.64,milliseconds when converting to unit of
1047.52,5.12,time much much longer than physical t1
1050.16,4.72,times
1052.64,4.48,finally what we need to note is that
1054.88,4.72,since this is an error detection code we
1057.12,4.799,are throwing out data when we detect an
1059.6,4.319,error as you see in this acceptance
1061.919,4.721,probability plot in red
1063.919,5.041,as you run more and more rounds there
1066.64,5.279,are less and less accepted results
1068.96,5.36,throwing out more and more data
1071.919,3.921,in our recent paper calibrated decoders
1074.32,3.599,for experimental quantum error
1075.84,5.6,correction which has been accepted to
1077.919,6.241,prl we evaluate a new decoding technique
1081.44,5.04,and consider partial post selection that
1084.16,4.639,will allow us to keep more data than
1086.48,4.4,doing full post selection as shown in
1088.799,3.841,the example here
1090.88,4.08,but if you really want to have a
1092.64,5.6,scalable error correction code you need
1094.96,6.32,at least distance 3 total of 23 qubits
1098.24,4.96,in a heavy hexagon lattice to correct an
1101.28,4.0,arbitrary error
1103.2,4.719,and that is the next experimental
1105.28,5.2,demonstration we did which can also be
1107.919,4.721,implemented on a falcon processor in our
1110.48,4.64,new paper matching and maximum
1112.64,4.48,likelihood decoding of a multi-round
1115.12,3.84,subsystem quantum error correction
1117.12,4.0,experiment
1118.96,4.48,so here's a summary
1121.12,4.32,of what we talked about today i just
1123.44,4.8,showed you d equals 2 quantum error
1125.44,5.359,detection demonstration on ibm falcon
1128.24,4.559,processor where we saw a benefit of
1130.799,4.24,logical encoding
1132.799,5.041,using the same device we can map a d
1135.039,4.481,equals 3 error correction code which i
1137.84,4.32,didn't discuss today but we have
1139.52,4.8,demonstrated in our new paper
1142.16,4.48,i hope you have a better idea of why we
1144.32,4.32,are continuing to build larger devices
1146.64,4.0,in a heavy hexagon lattice which
1148.64,5.039,provides more practical layout with
1150.64,4.64,higher yield of collision-free device
1153.679,4.88,and jumping to the very bottom of the
1155.28,5.92,slide you can see ibm's current progress
1158.559,4.48,on the hardware roadmap we are on track
1161.2,4.24,to our target systems
1163.039,5.201,and note that as the number of qubits
1165.44,5.2,increased in each generation you can map
1168.24,4.72,a larger distance code
1170.64,4.24,so as we increase the number of qubits
1172.96,3.839,we need to work on lowering physical
1174.88,4.72,error rates bringing them to well below
1176.799,5.281,the threshold so as we encode a logical
1179.6,5.28,qubit into a larger number of qubits we
1182.08,5.12,can achieve negligible logical air rates
1184.88,3.28,that we can use to solving more complex
1187.2,3.839,problems
1188.16,4.879,thank you for your attention
1191.039,4.401,micah thank you i have questions for you
1193.039,4.0,that run the gamut from very detailed to
1195.44,2.8,big picture so
1197.039,3.041,get ready
1198.24,3.52,to start out with when you were talking
1200.08,3.36,about the change in hardware structure
1201.76,3.919,you mentioned that the newer structure
1203.44,4.64,results in fewer collisions could you
1205.679,4.48,talk with us about frequency collisions
1208.08,4.959,and what that means yeah
1210.159,5.361,so at ibm we've been working with fixed
1213.039,5.201,frequency transport qubits so that means
1215.52,4.32,that we have a fixed frequency qubits
1218.24,4.08,that we don't modify the frequencies of
1219.84,4.0,the qubits and we always have an always
1222.32,4.0,on coupling between the neighboring
1223.84,4.48,qubits so say if the two qubits are
1226.32,3.68,coupled when the both qubits have the
1228.32,3.359,same frequency
1230.0,3.52,you know that could be a problem so say
1231.679,3.12,in controlling one of them you know it
1233.52,4.24,could actually couple to the second
1234.799,4.961,qubit and also in transmog qubits
1237.76,4.56,there's not only this zero one state
1239.76,4.159,that we use for qubit state but there
1242.32,3.599,are also higher transition that you have
1243.919,4.0,to worry about so those are there are a
1245.919,3.921,lot of not just a zero one frequency but
1247.919,3.841,there are a lot of other frequency
1249.84,4.24,um to the specific qubit that you want
1251.76,4.799,to avoid having coupled to so by
1254.08,4.0,changing this the lattice you know from
1256.559,4.161,the square lattice to heavy hexagon
1258.08,4.959,lattice each qubit is coupled to much to
1260.72,3.68,less qubits so by having less qubits
1263.039,2.961,neighboring them
1264.4,3.84,you have less uh chance of having a
1266.0,5.28,collision so that actually leads to
1268.24,4.96,having a better yield and fabricating a
1271.28,3.92,good collision-free device
1273.2,4.8,so it's not that
1275.2,5.92,qubits are colliding less frequently
1278.0,5.84,rather that the frequency
1281.12,4.72,collisions are happening less often
1283.84,4.16,right so it's from the beginning
1285.84,3.6,once you make a device the cubic
1288.0,3.52,frequency that we don't change it so
1289.44,4.4,it's a defined um
1291.52,4.48,parameter so you know once you make the
1293.84,4.16,device if there's a collision you can't
1296.0,3.44,really use that so then you have to try
1298.0,3.919,making a new device with different
1299.44,4.8,frequencies and you want to
1301.919,4.721,make it so that there are no collisions
1304.24,4.08,got it thank you for the clarification
1306.64,4.8,you also mentioned that the newer falcon
1308.32,5.599,devices have achieved higher coherences
1311.44,3.92,what relationship does that have to the
1313.919,4.0,error correction demos that you're
1315.36,5.12,working on yeah it's a great question so
1317.919,5.921,with higher coherences you know it also
1320.48,5.28,relates to lowering um a lot of
1323.84,4.88,physical qubit error rates so i
1325.76,4.799,mentioned about how with the
1328.72,3.76,quantum era correction demonstration we
1330.559,4.881,want to have lower and lower physical
1332.48,5.6,errors so by having a long coherence you
1335.44,4.719,could achieve lower air rates so if you
1338.08,3.92,you know and also there are times that
1340.159,4.321,the qubits are just going to be idling
1342.0,3.84,and just by having that longer coherence
1344.48,3.84,you know you don't have to have the
1345.84,3.92,gates as fast as you can you know just
1348.32,3.599,you know it's the same if you have the
1349.76,4.0,gates with the same length if you have a
1351.919,3.281,twice as long coherence you know the
1353.76,2.96,errors that's going to accumulate during
1355.2,3.359,that same period of time is going to be
1356.72,4.24,less so that is going to directly
1358.559,4.0,translate into how the qubit and logical
1360.96,3.36,cubic performance will be so the
1362.559,3.841,coherence is another really important
1364.32,2.88,factor yes got it
1366.4,2.24,so
1367.2,3.68,when we think about
1368.64,4.8,what's in the wings what are the next
1370.88,3.679,steps towards improving logical qubit
1373.44,3.52,performance
1374.559,4.561,yeah so you know again the logical the
1376.96,3.92,physical area that has to go down we
1379.12,3.679,also want to improve the measurement
1380.88,3.52,capabilities right now the measurements
1382.799,3.36,are pretty long
1384.4,4.32,um and also in our systems and
1386.159,5.041,superconducting qubits as i mentioned
1388.72,5.12,about higher higher states that's not
1391.2,3.599,just a zero one state in um just one
1393.84,3.199,qubits
1394.799,4.481,but you do have some leaked states that
1397.039,4.241,could that could be there so we we want
1399.28,4.72,those errors to go away so we need to
1401.28,4.399,reduce a lot of errors not just gate
1404.0,3.84,errors but also measurement errors and
1405.679,4.561,those leakage errors but also you know
1407.84,4.48,as you grow to larger lattice you know
1410.24,4.08,you could try to implement these these
1412.32,4.8,new logical
1414.32,3.599,logical qubits but also we do want to
1417.12,2.559,think
1417.919,3.441,not just this you know
1419.679,3.441,just in large just making
1421.36,4.16,larger and larger devices but we also
1423.12,4.159,want to come up with a way to have a
1425.52,3.84,more efficient error correction so in
1427.279,3.841,the theory aside there's a lot of
1429.36,3.84,progress that's been made that not just
1431.12,4.32,in the planar code so we also want to
1433.2,3.839,start considering how this could be done
1435.44,4.56,in a hardware
1437.039,5.12,got it so let's jump it up it sounds
1440.0,3.919,like error correction is something that
1442.159,3.841,we all take for granted in classical
1443.919,3.921,computing but it's a reality and an
1446.0,4.24,important problem to be solved would you
1447.84,4.0,say that quantum error correction is
1450.24,4.559,critical to the future of quantum
1451.84,4.88,computing yeah absolutely so
1454.799,4.561,quantum air correction by having that
1456.72,4.079,ability to correct for some errors
1459.36,2.72,you know qubits are
1460.799,2.321,quantum systems are always going to be
1462.08,3.44,noisy
1463.12,4.32,so we need some way to correct for those
1465.52,4.88,errors especially if you want something
1467.44,4.88,accurate also if you want in theory if
1470.4,3.92,there are if you have a full-time and
1472.32,4.239,quantum computer say then that
1474.32,5.04,definitely could give you an advantage
1476.559,4.321,say an exponential advantage um that
1479.36,2.96,doesn't necessarily mean that you know
1480.88,4.0,without error correction you can't do
1482.32,4.4,anything right but you know with with
1484.88,3.679,with the proof that we have now within
1486.72,4.16,theory you do need error correction for
1488.559,3.761,these really complex problems but even
1490.88,3.6,without there are a lot of things that
1492.32,4.32,you might be able to try in the in the
1494.48,3.679,near term where you know we now have a
1496.64,4.32,device that is
1498.159,4.64,over 100 cubits 127 cubic eagle device
1500.96,4.48,was just deployed last year and it's
1502.799,4.24,very exciting it's it's something that
1505.44,3.359,uh you know we can't simulate anymore in
1507.039,3.76,the you know if we can't simulate
1508.799,4.161,efficiently in a classical computer so
1510.799,4.161,you know with with that device with you
1512.96,4.4,know if you if we could have a slightly
1514.96,4.56,lower errors
1517.36,3.919,and then maybe apply some mitigation
1519.52,3.44,method even without quantum error
1521.279,3.201,correction we might be able to see some
1522.96,3.44,advantage and that's a very it's a very
1524.48,4.4,exciting time it sounds like and it
1526.4,4.399,sounds like error correction is a an
1528.88,3.679,important piece in the puzzle yes
1530.799,3.281,fantastic
1532.559,3.36,well micah this has been extremely
1534.08,3.28,informative and so interesting to learn
1535.919,3.601,about thank you so much for taking the
1537.36,3.76,time to share your work with us today
1539.52,3.36,and i want to go ahead and say thank you
1541.12,4.0,to our audience as well
1542.88,4.08,we'll be back next month with an ai
1545.12,4.4,themed session on using grammar rules
1546.96,6.68,and graphs for molecular generation so
1549.52,4.12,stay tuned see you soon
1560.88,2.08,you
