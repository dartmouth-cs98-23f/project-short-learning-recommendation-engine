hey guys and welcome to another video
from fast take skills series in this
video i'm gonna talk about a very
interesting concept which is parallel
computing
uh this topic or this way of computing i
should say
uh has been very very popular in the
past years and there's a specific reason
why which i'm going to discuss in this
video but let's have a look at
traditional computing
the type of computing which is not
parallel
so we have the processor here
and the instructions come in and the
processor does the processing and then
you have the processed data here as you
can see there's a queue of
new instructions coming in and the
processor is doing its job and then we
get kind of processed data out of it now
there's a problem with this approach
especially in the past couple of years
and the problem is that
we can only make this processor
faster to a limit
there is a frequency limit and the
reason uh there are plenty of reasons
actually but one of the important ones
is heat because
these processors are
very very
kind of
condensed so the amount of hit
generated by electrons moving through
the processor is
very very high and that's one of the
reasons why we can't really increase the
speed of processors at one single
processor
because it will melt down so because of
this reason we had to take a different
approach so if we want to increase the
speed but we can't really increase the
speed in one single processor because of
heat then what can we do
so one thing we can do is to increase
the number of processors this way we
have two
processors running simultaneously
and we divide the tasks between these
two processors
this is called parallel computing to
processor running at the same time doing
the calculations and we divide the
workload between these two processor of
course this introduces a new set of
potential problems and one of them is
more bugs because you should know when
first which instructions you need to
divide
and what instructions need to be
dedicated to each of these processors
because let's say that you assign a kind
of a process to this processor here and
that task gets done
fast but this task is dependent on a
process which is currently being run by
the other process here so you can have a
kind of uh
latencies you can have a different kind
of problems when it comes to writing
programs for parallel systems of course
majority of computers especially since
past couple of years
are all the computers are running on
multi-process multi-core processors so
that's another thing each processor in
the modern company computing is called a
core so a quad core a dual core and
that's basically
that explains the number of processors
running at the same time so this is a
very very short video on what parallel
computing is we also have distributed
computing which is the subject of
another video thanks for watching this
video and i'll see you later bye
