3.199,4.08,and in this video we are going to
5.12,3.519,discuss what is instruction set
7.279,3.44,architecture
8.639,4.641,the instruction set architecture
10.719,4.721,abbreviated as isa and it is a part of
13.28,3.999,the processor architecture
15.44,4.08,the instruction set architecture
17.279,4.641,basically works as an interface between
19.52,4.64,the hardware and the software
21.92,4.64,in simple words the instruction set
24.16,4.72,architecture is defined as the entire
26.56,4.4,group of commands that the processor can
28.88,3.519,perform to execute the program
30.96,4.32,instructions
32.399,5.761,every processor design is based on one
35.28,5.279,specific instruction set architecture
38.16,5.04,the instruction set architecture only
40.559,5.281,defines the operational capacity of the
43.2,4.56,processor in terms of set of commands
45.84,3.28,that the processor can decode and
47.76,4.56,execute
49.12,6.72,for example the intel 8085 instruction
52.32,7.039,set architecture consists of total 246
55.84,5.84,operation codes and 74 instructions
59.359,4.641,let us now talk about how instruction
61.68,3.92,set architecture is implemented into the
64.0,3.28,processor design
65.6,4.24,the processor architecture at the
67.28,4.48,hardware level is also referred to as
69.84,4.4,microarchitecture
71.76,5.12,the term micro architecture is defined
74.24,5.12,as the actual hardware implementation of
76.88,5.04,the instruction set architecture
79.36,4.56,in other words the micro architecture is
81.92,4.559,the hardware circuitry of the processor
83.92,4.8,chip that implements one particular
86.479,4.241,instruction set architecture
88.72,4.64,the instruction set architecture does
90.72,4.16,not specify the actual implementation
93.36,2.96,details of the instruction set
94.88,3.599,architecture
96.32,4.4,and therefore the chip manufacturing
98.479,4.401,brand can decide how to implement the
100.72,4.96,instruction set architecture into the
102.88,4.8,processor micro architecture design
105.68,4.079,and for this reason the two different
107.68,4.399,processor brands that are based on the
109.759,4.4,same instruction set architecture can
112.079,4.481,have different implementation into the
114.159,5.041,processor micro architecture
116.56,4.559,all right so far we have defined and
119.2,4.0,understood the concept of the
121.119,4.161,instruction set architecture and how it
123.2,3.519,is implemented into the processor micro
125.28,3.92,architecture
126.719,4.801,let us now briefly discuss some other
129.2,4.48,important fundamental concepts related
131.52,4.24,to the processor architecture and its
133.68,3.52,correlation with the instruction set
135.76,3.44,architecture
137.2,4.32,the instruction format is another
139.2,4.56,important design concept that is part of
141.52,4.719,the processor architecture
143.76,5.36,the computer program consists of set of
146.239,5.681,instructions which directs the cpu to
149.12,5.119,perform some specific operations
151.92,4.8,however we all understand that the
154.239,4.321,computer can execute only low-level
156.72,3.04,machine instructions in the binary
158.56,3.52,format
159.76,4.08,and therefore all high-level programs
162.08,4.72,are first compiled with the help of a
163.84,5.36,special software called the compiler
166.8,4.719,the compiler translates the high-level
169.2,4.48,program instructions into the low-level
171.519,3.36,machine instructions in the binary
173.68,3.839,format
174.879,4.881,the instruction format basically defines
177.519,5.121,the layout of the machine instruction in
179.76,5.68,terms of operation code operand and the
182.64,5.519,addressing mode the instruction format
185.44,4.719,supported by the processor depends upon
188.159,3.36,the instruction set architecture of the
190.159,3.601,processor
191.519,4.161,and therefore the processor can support
193.76,3.68,the instruction formats that are
195.68,3.279,compatible with its instruction set
197.44,4.0,architecture
198.959,4.721,let us summarize what is instruction set
201.44,4.96,architecture the instruction set
203.68,5.279,architecture abbreviated as isa as a
206.4,4.8,part of the processor architecture
208.959,4.64,in simple words the instruction set
211.2,4.72,architecture is defined as the entire
213.599,4.401,group of commands that the processor can
215.92,3.52,perform to execute the program
218.0,3.84,instructions
219.44,5.4,all right so that brings to the end of
221.84,5.759,this tutorial on what is instruction set
224.84,4.92,architecture in this tutorial we have
227.599,4.401,discussed in detail some important
229.76,4.479,fundamental concepts related to the
