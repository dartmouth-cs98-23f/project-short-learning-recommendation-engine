second,duration,transcript
0.24,4.48,now i know my audience y'all are
2.399,3.92,aspiring software developers or current
4.72,4.32,software developers so i know you've
6.319,4.641,come across a video titled a day in the
9.04,4.8,life of a software engineer youtube is
10.96,5.6,absolutely plastered with them eating
13.84,4.48,typing eating meeting eating
16.56,4.0,i don't know why they eat so much but
18.32,3.6,i've made my fair share of daily life of
20.56,3.6,a software engineer even day in life
21.92,3.92,computer science student and plenty of
24.16,4.0,others have done the same as what i
25.84,4.56,tried to do and showed you the actual
28.16,4.16,day and some of the actual work of a
30.4,3.839,software engineer instead of just what
32.32,3.28,is being done just typing is a lot
34.239,3.681,different than the actual work that is
35.6,4.56,getting done as a software engineer but
37.92,5.92,regardless of what they showed you
40.16,5.28,every single one had something in common
43.84,3.76,and that is this
45.44,3.279,they're all taking place
47.6,3.2,inside
48.719,4.241,at a computer and that is the first
50.8,4.0,realization i want you to make as a
52.96,4.64,software engineer for most of your life
54.8,4.8,you're going to be inside sitting at a
57.6,5.2,computer now personally i don't see that
59.6,5.04,being most suitable for most humans we
62.8,4.4,i'd think we weren't made to be sitting
64.64,3.92,at a desk for eight hours a day so just
67.2,4.0,out the gate if that's something that
68.56,4.879,doesn't sound too appetizing to you then
71.2,3.76,you may want to take a deeper look into
73.439,3.281,the potential career path that you're
74.96,3.199,currently looking at as a software
76.72,3.92,engineer and that's what we're doing in
78.159,5.041,this video looking at the hard truths of
80.64,4.08,being a software engineer what it takes
83.2,3.599,and not just
84.72,4.8,the highlight reel so
86.799,2.721,let's get started
91.16,4.44,[Music]
94.079,3.841,now we have a lot to discuss in this
95.6,4.479,video so sit back relax with a hot cup
97.92,4.0,of coffee i'm making mine now in the
100.079,3.841,most insane way possible and so far in
101.92,3.6,my experience the best way possible
103.92,3.76,commentary they're the sponsor of
105.52,3.919,today's video a coffee company of coffee
107.68,3.68,nerds who have figured out a way to brew
109.439,4.401,with a process that's carefully
111.36,4.399,calibrated to extract as much flavor as
113.84,4.4,possible from the beans which is then
115.759,4.0,flash frozen into what they call an icy
118.24,3.199,puck i don't know if i've ever heard a
119.759,3.841,cooler name and all i do since i drink
121.439,4.241,my coffee black is i drop the puck into
123.6,4.159,my cup pour in my hot water that melts
125.68,4.32,the puck which by the way is brewed 10
127.759,4.48,times stronger so i can do just this
130.0,4.959,it's not diluting by any means and i
132.239,5.441,enjoy by far the best cup of coffee i've
134.959,4.081,ever had and this fully recyclable as is
137.68,3.04,all of their packaging and shipping
139.04,3.36,materials which for someone living on
140.72,3.599,the coast seeing trash wash up onto the
142.4,3.76,beach left and right is incredibly
144.319,3.681,important to me speaking of which i've
146.16,3.6,been taking this on our beach days i've
148.0,3.68,been taking this on our boat days i just
149.76,3.839,put a capsule in my bag and once it
151.68,3.919,melts i just pour it over my ice water
153.599,4.321,and don't tell because while i almost
155.599,4.64,always drink my coffee black sometimes
157.92,4.319,instead of water i'll pour it over iced
160.239,3.521,milk to make myself a latte if you
162.239,3.601,haven't tried that it's
163.76,3.68,it's really good so i'm going to enjoy
165.84,4.0,my coffee and wanted to let you know
167.44,4.4,that currently cometier isn't fully open
169.84,3.6,to the public just yet but by going
171.84,4.399,through my link below you're able to
173.44,5.04,bypass the wait list and also receive 50
176.239,5.761,off your first purchase that's just one
178.48,5.6,dollar a cup enjoy
182.0,4.239,most of the experiences you see are from
184.08,3.36,software engineers on youtube sharing
186.239,3.121,their day
187.44,3.28,but that is a biased point of view
189.36,4.0,they're entertainers they want you to
190.72,4.48,watch the entire video think about it it
193.36,4.32,is a lot easier to sit down and watch an
195.2,4.56,hour-long movie that has been directed
197.68,3.76,and filmed and has a story throughout
199.76,4.399,rather than sitting down and watching an
201.44,4.64,hour-long lecture can we agree on that
204.159,4.72,and people who want to share their
206.08,4.48,experience want you to be captivated by
208.879,4.161,their day they want you to watch the
210.56,4.319,video as long as they can get you to
213.04,3.6,watch the video because the whole idea
214.879,3.681,with a lot of these channels especially
216.64,3.92,on youtube whether it be software
218.56,4.08,engineer or not the whole idea is for
220.56,5.12,them or for you to forget about the
222.64,3.92,entire outside world and focus on their
225.68,2.88,video
226.56,5.12,watch their video in its entirety be
228.56,5.52,consumed by being entertained by it and
231.68,4.88,well that is the main goal whether it is
234.08,4.4,helping you out or educating you that is
236.56,3.52,the goal i only bring this up because
238.48,3.6,it's a highlight reel at best or
240.08,3.76,misinforming you at worst so don't look
242.08,3.92,at these videos and think that's exactly
243.84,4.64,how it is because you can't see into the
246.0,4.319,minds of these individuals they aren't
248.48,3.119,just typing aimlessly on a keyboard
250.319,3.041,they're deep in thought trying to figure
251.599,3.521,out the solution to the task at hand and
253.36,4.48,then doing research and implementing
255.12,3.679,that solution in code and in their
257.84,2.56,meetings they're not just shooting the
258.799,4.081,briefs with the co-workers they're being
260.4,5.12,told that the entire week's worth of
262.88,4.24,work before is completely worthless
265.52,2.72,because the client decided to go another
267.12,3.04,route and they don't want that feature
268.24,4.16,implemented anymore or you're being told
270.16,4.72,that your task was done incorrectly so
272.4,5.359,now you have to redo it and those
274.88,4.64,meetings are never fun but you know it's
277.759,3.121,not all bad sometimes you are just
279.52,2.88,shooting the breeze with your co-workers
280.88,2.879,and discussing what to do next and
282.4,3.2,plenty of the things that i mentioned in
283.759,2.961,this video may be see
285.6,4.319,seen as
286.72,4.0,negative or or whatever it may be or it
289.919,2.321,may
290.72,3.12,appear that i'm trying to discourage
292.24,3.92,some individuals from becoming software
293.84,4.16,engineers no i'm trying to show you the
296.16,4.08,reality of what it's like to be a
298.0,4.32,software engineer not just the good
300.24,3.679,thing so if i do focus on things that
302.32,2.879,are a little bit more
303.919,3.441,negative
305.199,3.44,don't see that the majority of the job
307.36,3.119,is negative i'm just trying to
308.639,3.84,counteract all of the
310.479,3.601,positive and all of the good things the
312.479,4.241,highlight reel that people are putting
314.08,4.48,out there but neglecting to do so for
316.72,4.24,the bad thing because you need to
318.56,4.479,understand that in any job especially
320.96,4.239,this job there's a give-and-take
323.039,4.401,good and bad which brings us to the
325.199,4.081,everlasting question especially staying
327.44,3.84,on topic when it comes to software
329.28,3.84,engineering youtubers like myself i'm
331.28,4.0,not i'm not i'm not calling anyone out
333.12,3.519,in particular i am a software engineer
335.28,3.199,and computer science youtuber just like
336.639,4.081,everyone else and i made the same videos
338.479,3.841,because the everlasting question
340.72,4.319,really contradicts how a lot of these
342.32,6.159,people portray their day as being always
345.039,5.361,good always positive always fun
348.479,3.521,but most of these youtubers who display
350.4,3.84,it like that end up quitting their
352.0,4.96,full-time software engineering job to do
354.24,4.48,youtube full-time well if it is all
356.96,3.76,butterflies and rainbows on the software
358.72,3.28,engineering side of that then why do
360.72,4.319,they quit
362.0,4.72,that job i know why i've done it but for
365.039,4.401,me it may be a little bit different than
366.72,5.039,most so i've always wanted to work for
369.44,4.879,myself if i never discovered youtube i'd
371.759,4.16,probably be freelancing so for me it
374.319,2.88,wasn't always about what i was doing as
375.919,3.681,long as i could
377.199,3.28,do something that i enjoyed and work for
379.6,2.319,myself
380.479,3.28,many of these individuals probably
381.919,4.0,shared the same sentiment after all they
383.759,3.681,did start a youtube channel for a reason
385.919,2.881,that reason could be because they
387.44,3.039,thought it was fun because they wanted
388.8,3.119,to help people out or because they saw
390.479,4.16,it leading to their financial freedom
391.919,5.12,whatever it may be they saw this as
394.639,4.801,being part of their future but also
397.039,4.241,because if they truly enjoyed coding
399.44,4.56,this was a way for them to make it
401.28,4.88,living but also be able to work on their
404.0,3.84,own projects which brings me to one of
406.16,3.36,the biggest points of this video which i
407.84,3.28,feel like people never talk about that
409.52,4.16,is working as a professional software
411.12,5.12,engineer is working for someone else's
413.68,4.239,company working on someone else's idea
416.24,3.44,you may love the idea you may love
417.919,3.601,working on that app but you never have
419.68,3.76,the final say on what features are
421.52,3.76,implemented or even exactly how it looks
423.44,4.24,or the overall growth of the company and
425.28,4.24,where that app will be in five years for
427.68,4.48,lack of a better term you're very much a
429.52,5.04,code monkey being told what to do and
432.16,5.039,how to do it with very little creative
434.56,4.72,freedom some creative freedom but very
437.199,4.241,little i personally can't work that way
439.28,4.24,but for some people that may be their
441.44,4.0,cup of tea you need that direction you
443.52,4.399,need that structure so this may be
445.44,6.0,perfect for you i know people who thrive
447.919,5.521,on not completing the overall idea or
451.44,2.72,worrying about the overall app
453.44,3.68,but
454.16,5.12,solving the task at hand each individual
457.12,4.24,task is like a new
459.28,3.68,challenge for them and that is what gets
461.36,3.679,them going in the morning they know that
462.96,4.0,they get to work on this task that task
465.039,3.84,and that task they don't have to worry
466.96,4.4,about the growth of the company or the
468.879,4.481,growth of the app or the user interface
471.36,3.92,they are a backend developer and all
473.36,4.16,they have to worry about are
475.28,4.16,these tasks today
477.52,5.28,and that's basically it there really is
479.44,5.92,a luxury in that if you are wired that
482.8,4.239,way but if you are someone who got into
485.36,2.959,development because you wanted to create
487.039,3.801,your own
488.319,4.56,apps you wanted to make your ideas a
490.84,4.52,reality then
492.879,4.401,it gets a little bit dicey there but to
495.36,4.72,sum it all up many people get into
497.28,4.96,coding to make their ideas a reality it
500.08,4.959,starts off as a hobby but it becomes a
502.24,4.32,job once you make it your job the old
505.039,3.521,adage says do what you enjoy and you
506.56,4.56,never work a day in your life but making
508.56,4.719,something your job that you do enjoy
511.12,4.32,will often times take the enjoyment out
513.279,3.921,of it so what is an actual day in the
515.44,3.92,life of a software engineer well this
517.2,4.56,will vary from company to company team
519.36,4.96,to team person to person but the overall
521.76,4.16,structure is typically the same you have
524.32,3.04,stand up about every day this is when
525.92,3.52,you get together with your team you talk
527.36,4.24,about what you did since the last stand
529.44,4.56,up any roadblocks that you're facing and
531.6,3.84,what you plan to do next now when you
534.0,3.92,accomplish everything that you set out
535.44,4.0,to do the day before your confidence is
537.92,3.68,through the roof you're a genius
539.44,4.16,programmer and you just want to tell
541.6,4.16,everyone what you did in that stand up
543.6,4.96,and you love it
545.76,5.84,however there's a flip side to this coin
548.56,5.6,if you spent the entire previous day
551.6,4.64,working on a two-hour task and still
554.16,5.04,maybe haven't even figured it out well
556.24,3.92,then you just feel
559.2,3.199,bad
560.16,3.52,bad no bad doesn't really begin to
562.399,3.521,describe you
563.68,4.0,begin to maybe get a little bit anxious
565.92,5.2,you're very stressed out you feel
567.68,6.159,incompetent because you're the developer
571.12,4.56,being paid to do a particular job and
573.839,4.241,complete this particular test and it
575.68,5.04,says is estimated to be completed in two
578.08,4.16,hours and you spent six hours doing it
580.72,3.52,the day before and you still haven't
582.24,3.36,even completed it it's like if you have
584.24,4.32,to present something in front of the
585.6,5.04,entire class that you know you didn't do
588.56,4.0,and the whole entire class knows you
590.64,3.44,failed but at work
592.56,3.6,you're not only worried about what your
594.08,4.4,classmates think of you or your teacher
596.16,4.88,thinks of you or your grade
598.48,5.76,but the stability of your job your
601.04,6.4,livelihood i mean you tried but you just
604.24,5.039,couldn't successfully complete the task
607.44,4.88,it is an incredibly stressful feeling
609.279,4.721,that i hated every second of when that
612.32,4.079,would happen to me and honestly it could
614.0,4.399,just be because i felt like my team were
616.399,4.0,genius programmers i mean in their
618.399,3.921,defense they kind of were they had 20
620.399,2.88,years experience each under their belt
622.32,2.24,so
623.279,2.721,yeah
624.56,2.88,needless to say i was a little bit
626.0,3.76,intimidated by them even though they
627.44,5.2,were incredibly nice and help me out
629.76,4.48,even with those traits i still felt that
632.64,3.52,way with that being said i couldn't even
634.24,3.52,begin to think about having a boss or a
636.16,3.359,team that just like
637.76,4.4,is mean or
639.519,3.921,opposite of that that would suck but you
642.16,3.28,know maybe you're a better programmer
643.44,3.839,than me maybe that stuff never happens
645.44,3.519,to you so you never have to feel that
647.279,4.24,way i don't know i can tell you my
648.959,4.721,experiences and mishaps all i want but
651.519,4.641,at the end of the day many things cannot
653.68,5.92,be learned from other people's mistakes
656.16,4.239,oftentimes you have to make the mistake
659.6,4.239,or
660.399,5.361,in this instance you have to experience
663.839,3.44,that situation in order to understand
665.76,4.0,what it actually feels like and maybe
667.279,4.161,you thrive in those situations maybe you
669.76,3.519,hate those situations but you'll never
671.44,3.28,know until you're in it it kind of
673.279,3.041,reminds me of an analogy it's like
674.72,3.84,whenever you're at a restaurant and the
676.32,3.92,waiter hands you your food and they sail
678.56,4.399,it you know hot plates so they put on
680.24,5.36,your table but you gotta see just how
682.959,4.0,hot that plate is so you touch it
685.6,3.76,sometimes you gotta figure things out
686.959,4.081,for yourself on the job the amount of
689.36,3.919,coding that is expected from you is
691.04,4.799,typically around six hours this is how
693.279,4.641,they base it on tasks so if you have a
695.839,3.761,two hour task a three hour task and a
697.92,3.12,one hour test you can complete that in
699.6,3.12,one day but you can't complete another
701.04,4.239,two hour task on top of that for the
702.72,4.96,eight hours a day because you have stand
705.279,5.281,up you have meetings you have breaks all
707.68,5.04,of that ties in to your eight hour day
710.56,4.32,so don't go in expecting that you're
712.72,4.4,going to be coding for eight hours a day
714.88,4.24,typically what your team should expect
717.12,4.48,is around six
719.12,4.159,now if you've seen my video how long i
721.6,5.12,code a day you will see that i'm
723.279,6.161,typically burned out around four hours
726.72,4.559,so an extra two is a lot to handle but
729.44,4.16,it also depends on the work at hand i've
731.279,4.401,spent eight ten hours almost straight
733.6,3.84,you know i have to eat and go to the
735.68,4.159,bathroom and stuff but basically almost
737.44,4.24,straight coding and when i say coding
739.839,4.321,that is basically by the definition that
741.68,4.64,i laid out in that video how long i code
744.16,4.56,a day and that is including everything
746.32,4.0,from research to actually typing out
748.72,2.96,your code but that's when i'm working on
750.32,2.72,something simple or fairly
751.68,3.12,straightforward something that's already
753.04,3.12,been laid out but when you have to
754.8,3.12,figure out how to code something that
756.16,3.919,has never been done in your language in
757.92,4.24,your stack in your context well then it
760.079,3.76,makes things quite a bit more difficult
762.16,3.119,more brain power is needed to figure out
763.839,3.601,the logic you have to figure out how to
765.279,4.56,use it in your language with your stack
767.44,5.199,in your context and the more brain power
769.839,4.961,you use the more energy you use and the
772.639,4.161,quicker you get burnt out i don't mean
774.8,4.719,burnt out in how you've been hearing it
776.8,4.4,a lot lately but just on that day more
779.519,4.081,brain power is needed to figure out the
781.2,4.879,logic and to implement it in your
783.6,4.96,language using your stack and in your
786.079,5.041,exact context and the more brain power
788.56,4.8,you use the more drained you get and
791.12,4.24,you're just tired i've said this before
793.36,4.24,how individuals who work hard labor will
795.36,5.039,never understand the mental drain that
797.6,4.799,it takes to do our job because it's not
800.399,4.081,physically difficult and the best way i
802.399,3.841,can describe the difference between
804.48,4.479,those eight to ten hour coding days and
806.24,4.88,the four hour coding days it's like
808.959,4.801,digging a little hole with a little
811.12,5.839,shovel for eight hours a day compared to
813.76,4.639,digging a giant hole with a real shovel
816.959,4.481,you're still digging
818.399,5.041,coding but one is much more taxing and
821.44,2.8,i've found a fine balance of being able
823.44,2.959,to
824.24,4.08,figure out when i've when i met my wits
826.399,3.521,in for that day if i'm working on
828.32,3.04,something a little bit more difficult
829.92,2.4,then maybe i'm in there three to four
831.36,2.719,hours
832.32,3.28,don't need to worry about anything else
834.079,3.12,at hand that needs to be done i'll save
835.6,3.679,that for another day but if i want to
837.199,5.521,relax and i want to do a little bit
839.279,5.201,easier work and nothing too too mentally
842.72,4.239,draining then i can do that too and i
844.48,4.479,can work as long as i want on my own
846.959,4.56,projects but when you're at work you're
848.959,4.0,expected to do six hours a day give or
851.519,3.041,take whatever your company wants you to
852.959,3.281,do if you have to do more than
854.56,3.68,the lord help you it's like all coding
856.24,3.92,work is treated equally when it's not
858.24,3.36,equal some tasks are a lot easier than
860.16,3.679,others but if you have a lot of
861.6,4.799,difficult tasks to do one day it's hard
863.839,5.12,to hit six hours of coding on difficult
866.399,4.24,tasks that is one of the downfalls when
868.959,2.88,it comes to working in a professional
870.639,2.721,environment and that's the entire
871.839,4.401,premise of what i wanted to discuss here
873.36,5.36,in today's video not to to bring anyone
876.24,4.159,away from being a software engineer but
878.72,4.16,rather show you some of the realities
880.399,4.24,that others do not on the outside you
882.88,3.04,see typing you see this wonderful app
884.639,3.361,that they created but you never see what
885.92,4.24,goes on in the meetings you never see
888.0,3.68,what goes on in their heads when they're
890.16,3.44,actually doing this work and the
891.68,3.519,difficulty of it and the nuances and
893.6,4.0,differences of working as a professional
895.199,3.44,developer than just as a hobby developer
897.6,2.96,i hope you learned something from
898.639,3.361,today's video but more so i hope you
900.56,3.04,give it a little bit more thought into
902.0,4.399,the potential career that you're looking
903.6,4.799,at based on the reality of it and not
906.399,3.601,how it's portrayed it's a fun job at
908.399,3.44,times but it feels like it can be the
910.0,3.36,worst job too let me know if you've had
911.839,3.12,a similar experience in the field or if
913.36,3.839,you've had a different experience in the
914.959,3.761,field completely opposite of how i feel
917.199,3.841,because at the end of the day this is
918.72,4.32,just one man's opinion one man's view
921.04,3.76,and experiences that i'm sharing and
923.04,3.599,that's mine i can't really speak from
924.8,3.92,anybody else's point of view so i'd love
926.639,4.32,to hear some of y'all current software
928.72,4.239,developers on y'all's experience what
930.959,4.0,you agree with what you disagree with
932.959,3.841,down in the comment section below like
934.959,4.161,subscribe hit the bell and enjoy
936.8,4.32,yourself some icy puck coffee from
939.12,3.0,cometier and i'll see you on the next
941.12,9.359,one
942.12,8.359,[Music]
