second,duration,transcript
0.089,7.891,why it is third design and visualization
2.78,7.149,especially why 3d computer graphics our
7.98,6.26,course title is digital design and
9.929,8.761,visualization why visualization matters
14.24,7.449,even simply say very pragmatic very
18.69,6.929,practical reason for enhancing your
21.689,6.531,design visualization skills okay how to
25.619,6.15,enhance your design technique design
28.22,5.769,representation techniques another one
31.769,4.761,for moving forward to advanced design
33.989,5.191,computing issues such as being okay
36.53,4.54,you have to know geometry modeling first
39.18,4.8,and then move to information modeling
41.07,7.37,approach him approach and even more
43.98,8.099,advanced approaches okay
48.44,5.83,main focus is here enhancing your design
52.079,4.491,representation design visualization
54.27,6.51,skills okay
56.57,7.51,let's briefly take a look again history
60.78,7.97,of computer aided design history of CAD
64.08,10.2,is a history of how to understand design
68.75,9.34,what is design ok around the 50 years
74.28,6.92,ago when the sketch pad the first caddy
78.09,6.54,system okay line drawing header system
81.2,6.34,computers computer system invented at
84.63,5.61,that time people believed that the
87.54,7.039,design is a drawing of the product that
90.24,9.089,is why we are focusing on elevation
94.579,9.011,plans perspective was something line
99.329,8.011,drawings okay so geometric drafting in
103.59,7.05,2d was the CAD system at the time but
107.34,6.51,some smart people invented 3ds of his
110.64,6.839,face the model approach okay Sophie
113.85,7.769,space the 3d representation it's 3d okay
117.479,7.32,you can rotate this box you can see it
121.619,6.241,happy front view section and so on
124.799,6.721,geometric surface modeling in 3d that is
127.86,5.99,so-called surface based 3d model even
131.52,5.94,smarter people
133.85,6.82,suggested and implemented 3d solid
137.46,7.71,modeling approach why solid think about
140.67,11.13,this one surface phase 3d looking object
145.17,9.33,looking 3d but surface doesn't have
151.8,5.73,thickness in other words it's
154.5,6.06,mathematical definition not real object
157.53,6.87,but can you find zero thickness object
160.56,7.56,in their world there is nothing there is
164.4,6.78,nothing like that in other words in real
168.12,6.06,world even if it's very very thin or
171.18,7.68,very lightweight anyway it has thickness
174.18,7.89,it has weight okay so we need to sort
178.86,6.06,the feel in the definition of geometry
182.07,6.75,so there is solely the model realistic
184.92,6.03,okay even smarter people invented
188.82,5.78,suggested and invented a parametric
190.95,6.5,model okay point line they are all
194.6,7.03,mathematical definition something
197.45,6.91,abstract something unreal it's not
201.63,7.53,realistic in real world we are using
204.36,7.13,with its depth thickness height what if
209.16,5.34,you want to control this one change
211.49,8.11,higher height and then this one going to
214.5,8.19,be updated okay not controlling parties
219.6,4.4,or lines and so on the most advanced one
222.69,5.1,is here
224.0,7.84,entire rest of things are the part of
227.79,8.04,this one more information what kind of
231.84,5.91,information compositional analytical and
235.83,5.3,fabrication representations of the
237.75,5.22,product going to be part of this model
241.13,6.579,so there is Building Information
242.97,6.239,modelling this semester we are still
247.709,4.531,focusing on this one
249.209,5.461,what if you use only 2d CAD characters
252.24,6.27,to the drawing trees that's going to be
254.67,6.59,here but thankfully we are here but the
258.51,7.29,problem is it's exactly same to sketchup
261.26,5.77,but lots of powerful and predefined well
265.8,3.27,defined as
267.03,5.58,facts of design visualization things in
269.07,5.85,3d Max and related tools so this is the
272.61,5.61,focus of this master how about next
274.92,6.95,semester rest of things and this one
278.22,6.51,also one part of the next semester's
281.87,5.62,these are design and beam course ok
284.73,5.97,anyway this is the scope of this
287.49,4.649,semester some prob others of course the
290.7,6.81,subject but not domain
292.139,8.451,anyway in my poetry is here ok let's
297.51,4.71,quickly review design mode we have
300.59,4.829,learned before
302.22,5.67,very simple mode of thought your brain
305.419,5.051,no one can see your brain
307.89,5.52,ok what is the inside of your head ok
310.47,4.71,it's not possible before you you are
313.41,4.59,saying something you are drawing
315.18,5.27,something you are creating some computer
318.0,5.28,file visualization or something else
320.45,6.4,before doing that no one can see your
323.28,7.97,idea but it's very still important to
326.85,8.37,you guys take a look the description
331.25,8.11,next one is mode of expression something
335.22,5.97,to be visualized final stage of course
339.36,8.79,mode of production ok
341.19,11.789,no need to say anyway take a look visual
348.15,7.019,equivalent visually equivalent to your
352.979,5.911,design concept design idea design
355.169,6.171,approach ok visualization is the most
358.89,8.25,important thing you need to achieve in
361.34,11.04,in your design expression mode okay how
367.14,9.5,about design media design by hand for
372.38,4.26,several thousands of thousand years
376.729,10.031,compared to human history more than 99%
380.58,10.02,of history used hand drawing ok pencil
386.76,6.45,or pens whatever it is but in this class
390.6,6.48,we are using computers but I told you
393.21,7.77,just 40 60 years ago computer has
397.08,7.94,invented carry systems just four years
400.98,8.94,okay your computer - 3d max 2015
405.02,8.29,released two years ago okay anyway we're
409.92,5.76,gonna use computers designed by penciled
413.31,6.03,computing that's the change we
415.68,8.79,encountered the pencil is the most basic
419.34,8.19,media of design nowadays you can simply
424.47,8.85,quickly draw by hand for your design
427.53,9.72,okay that's your kind of primitive idea
433.32,7.98,schedule or something but this is design
437.25,7.89,computing course we have lots of IT lots
441.3,7.26,of technologies we're gonna use new
445.14,5.76,media that's why I call digital design
448.56,6.03,this is the design media okay
450.9,8.34,you have to maximize the effect the
454.59,7.74,power of your media okay your media in
459.24,5.39,this room in this class of course it's
462.33,6.75,computers you are using smartphones
464.63,7.53,tablets some mobile devices mostly for
469.08,8.42,fun or for communicating with friends
472.16,8.74,but anyway you can use such some IT
477.5,8.01,tools for your design something
480.9,8.1,productive things here is an example
485.51,8.04,student walk freshman walk okay
489.0,7.08,freshman walk they didn't know any
493.55,4.57,computer software for design but they
496.08,5.12,have learned the Sketchup puree some
498.12,6.45,renderers Photoshop and they could make
501.2,3.94,this kind of visualization how about
504.57,5.37,this one
505.14,8.4,Jewish Museum slip box some something
509.94,6.27,not 100% but anyway looking realistic
513.54,5.1,looking realistic visualizations line
516.21,5.25,stroke Sketchup visualization scale
518.64,5.22,styles I assume that you are already
521.46,7.65,well-known to design visualization using
523.86,9.24,rhino autocad sketchup play array but in
529.11,5.1,this master 3d max design 3d max design
533.1,4.08,and auto
534.21,5.49,material mentalray some technical
537.18,5.75,aspects regarding such tourists and
539.7,7.44,Autodesk tours some primitive
542.93,5.95,introductory things about Autodesk Revit
547.14,6.33,and so on okay
548.88,6.78,that's the skull last week
553.47,5.04,I show you this one before what you have
555.66,6.2,to learn are listed up here some gray
558.51,6.81,phone's hardware internet software
561.86,7.02,operating systems some fundamentals in
565.32,6.3,engineering theory but anyway focus on
568.88,5.44,fundamentals in the lecture in the
571.62,4.62,lecture I'm gonna let you know what is
574.32,5.34,the critical one Dementors of design
576.24,8.76,computing theories okay we have midterm
579.66,7.049,exam November 21st regarding my lecture
585.0,5.85,oh okay based upon my lecture you're
586.709,6.301,gonna have the elec exam in the lab
590.85,4.29,exercise hours I told you again and
593.01,4.97,again in 3d max design mentor eight
595.14,6.18,we're a Photoshop intro to rabbit and
597.98,6.25,possible some more applications it's up
601.32,6.48,to you anyway that's the subject for lab
604.23,6.75,exercise even more things about design
607.8,5.61,computing such as 3d printing in this
610.98,5.04,semester you're gonna asked you want to
613.41,5.97,be asked to print something create
616.02,6.439,something by 3d max and print them out
619.38,8.459,using 3d max sorry 3d printers laser
622.459,7.721,scan photogrammetry virtual reality they
627.839,4.971,are one one of the subjects we're gonna
630.18,5.97,deal with in this semester okay
632.81,8.05,let's take a look at this 3d rendering
636.15,8.429,okay this is kind of very famous image
640.86,6.18,okay this is not a picture of course
644.579,5.82,it's a computer-generated image render
647.04,7.62,image so if you click this you can find
650.399,6.951,out some website link 3d rendering on
654.66,5.28,the Wikipedia there is the image okay
657.35,7.77,actually it's not important but anyway
659.94,7.949,gears Tran with appareil using radiosity
665.12,5.35,radiosity is one one of the technology
667.889,6.0,is available nowadays in photorealistic
670.47,8.7,rendering something like this even if
673.889,9.86,it's not kind of 3d max generated anyway
679.17,6.779,by using 3d Max and recently developed
683.749,5.02,technologies you can make this kind of
685.949,6.47,visualization even today actually
688.769,8.55,but anyway lots of more and
692.419,7.51,sophisticated handling you need but my
697.319,5.01,point here is nowadays complete
699.929,6.12,computing comfortable ideation technique
702.329,6.84,is very very advanced what you need to
706.049,8.28,do is take maximum advantages so we
709.169,9.03,existing technologies techniques ok is
714.329,6.18,this a picture or computer graphic why
718.199,4.47,it doesn't matter my answer is it
720.509,4.471,doesn't matter okay well of course this
722.669,7.23,is computer generated this is IKEA
724.98,8.399,product no matter what it is no problem
729.899,6.8,because visualization nowadays there is
733.379,6.42,no difference between real picture and
736.699,6.401,computer generated sometimes come to
739.799,6.45,generated looking materialistic then
743.1,7.139,pictures anyway take a look this
746.249,7.111,interior some type of office layout is
750.239,7.34,this a picture of course it's computer
753.36,9.209,generated how about this kitchen area
757.579,8.17,computer generated iCare iCare provides
762.569,8.19,you lots of some PDF file who are online
765.749,7.44,brochure or even printout brochure for
770.759,6.961,their products using computer graphics
773.189,5.76,ok not real product why they made this
777.72,6.959,kind of computer graphics
778.949,11.1,take a look same product IKEA product
784.679,8.13,for kitchen ok kitchen cabinets but IKEA
790.049,5.19,is kind of global company something for
792.809,5.34,Northern America something for Asia
795.239,6.341,market something for Europe European
798.149,6.191,style market some different process
801.58,7.2,different layouts a little bit different
804.34,7.2,things be to local environment what if
808.78,6.9,they have to take pictures for all of
811.54,7.62,them they have to remove and reinstall
815.68,5.84,take picture again and again but thanks
819.16,3.66,to computer graphics they made them
821.52,5.83,instantly
822.82,8.61,okay much cheaper than real picture so
827.35,5.91,take a look this guy I'm not sure he is
831.43,3.06,walking in there anyway he's in charge
833.26,3.99,of making these kind of real
834.49,6.0,visualization if you click this link I
837.25,7.95,just placed a reference for this one
840.49,8.87,okay in the visual news website take a
845.2,4.16,look the image that I show you okay
854.83,6.13,okay 70 pipe by percenter like your
858.59,6.18,product photographs actually comes to
860.96,6.33,generated okay the chair I show you and
864.77,8.67,the reason why they use this kind of
867.29,10.74,come to graphics and so on okay so in
873.44,7.77,this class like this guy we are going to
878.03,6.21,use Autodesk tizi sorry 3d max design
881.21,7.35,2015 because it's the latest version in
884.24,8.88,design model okay not 2016 or 17 2015
888.56,7.41,we're a Photoshop and video mentor II do
893.12,5.99,you know what is Nvidia the company name
895.97,6.75,and media is very very familiar to
899.11,7.33,gamers if you play in game you may know
902.72,7.14,and video NVIDIA GeForce have you heard
906.44,8.67,jeepers graphics card the GeForce
909.86,8.04,graphics card is one of the faster come
915.11,8.7,to graphic system and come to graphic
917.9,8.73,GPU engine GPU cardboard for computer
923.81,8.19,graphics okay anyway the company and
926.63,10.95,media both mental ray and mental ray is
932.0,9.02,a media software anyway anyway thanks to
937.58,6.42,mentor a and amount of well-defined
941.02,6.64,professionals material in Autodesk
944.0,7.91,material you can make very
947.66,4.25,photorealistic renderings and so on
952.21,7.99,take a look this one is actually not
956.39,7.68,100% photorealistic but anyway looking
960.2,8.27,photorealistic okay but actually I made
964.07,7.17,this image in three minutes in 3d mix
968.47,5.95,just three minutes so you need okay
971.24,4.77,place Selene DOE and cylinder extraction
974.42,6.44,in order to make this one is looking
976.01,7.68,glass plane and tourist not lights
980.86,4.21,render and you can get this kind of
983.69,4.17,image how about this one
985.07,6.78,last week I show you similar example
987.86,9.06,teapot with ceramic material flow plane
991.85,8.4,using wood floor crumbles and three
996.92,6.03,lights to white color lights actually
1000.25,6.66,for three lights and one yellow color
1002.95,6.54,lights okay but the dark black
1006.91,5.88,background simply because the background
1009.49,5.1,of this image just nothing just to
1012.79,6.66,collect background that is why this one
1014.59,6.84,reflects black okay so just a five
1019.45,6.18,minute by minute for making this
1021.43,7.35,visualization my point here is computer
1025.63,5.13,graphics rendering technique really
1028.78,4.11,advanced take a look this example
1030.76,4.8,computer graphics on other come to
1032.89,5.61,graphics even by using Sketchup
1035.56,4.8,easy-to-use application Sketchup and the
1038.5,4.7,beret you can make this kind of thin
1040.36,5.31,okay that's my point very easy to use
1043.2,7.44,but I show you actually very poor
1045.67,8.82,realistic images is your photorealistic
1050.64,7.41,visualization always top priority what I
1054.49,8.25,mean is photorealistic rendering is
1058.05,11.25,always your top priority my answer is of
1062.74,9.03,course no okay your idea from your brain
1069.3,5.11,composed of your computer model
1071.77,5.61,computational model 3d max file Sketchup
1074.41,6.14,file Rhino file Revit file whatever it
1077.38,8.03,is and then it's going to be visualized
1080.55,6.51,lots of visualization so what should be
1085.41,5.08,realistic
1087.06,5.67,you'll sketch your 3d your picture your
1090.49,5.91,animation sometimes they are visual
1092.73,7.0,photorealistic but I told you there is
1096.4,6.56,intermediate computer model so your
1099.73,6.63,comfort another supposed to be realistic
1102.96,5.95,in other words you should try your best
1106.36,6.09,for making your computational model
1108.91,4.29,intermediate model realistic not the
1112.45,4.17,outputs
1113.2,6.42,okay without this model directly from
1116.62,4.47,your brain from your idea to these
1119.62,3.95,outputs
1121.09,7.71,very recursive very time consuming
1123.57,6.01,tedious never-ending task you have to do
1128.8,4.08,okay
1129.58,8.55,your computational model is kind of very
1132.88,8.37,realistic and well made your output
1138.13,5.43,sometimes line during shaded sometimes
1141.25,6.08,photorealistic rendering sometimes very
1143.56,8.28,nice representation sometimes very
1147.33,7.96,abstract lines truck-based images
1151.84,11.04,sometimes flow plans and so on
1155.29,10.47,okay semantic integrity that is that
1162.88,6.27,thing the concept you have to be aware
1165.76,8.22,of for your building model for your
1169.15,7.11,computational model perón has your mini
1173.98,4.41,world what is the world what is the
1176.26,5.16,universe of this course
1178.39,6.15,what is the UD your definition over your
1181.42,4.05,word okay okay when you design your
1184.54,2.79,building
1185.47,8.7,think about your designing your home
1187.33,10.07,your new house is there Star Wars
1194.17,8.46,characters is there some some other
1197.4,8.74,buildings is there some how can I say
1202.63,5.51,some monsters in your universe of this
1206.14,5.58,course of course not okay
1208.14,6.19,your tip well define delivers first and
1211.72,5.64,your object your over your interest
1214.33,9.08,supposed to be same to your real-world
1217.36,11.04,object okay this is semantic integrity
1223.41,9.19,semantically same with your real-world
1228.4,6.96,object you are pursuing in terms of your
1232.6,7.08,mini world in terms of your university
1235.36,6.12,of this course this university sorry not
1239.68,4.35,university its universe okay
1241.48,4.95,this universe doesn't need to be same to
1244.03,5.58,real-world universe real-world universe
1246.43,6.21,what is this what is that this
1249.61,4.67,University this one contains anything
1252.64,6.649,this one has
1254.28,9.09,100% things we created what Mother
1259.289,6.991,Nature also one part of it anyway well
1263.37,5.549,defined your mini world your universe
1266.28,7.769,that is the important thing you need to
1268.919,8.341,take care of semantics this CAD model
1274.049,4.891,looks very just line drawing and color
1277.26,4.68,shade that's it but this one is
1278.94,5.31,photorealistic which one is better in
1281.94,5.849,terms of visualization this is looking
1284.25,5.85,better but what if this one has any
1287.789,5.851,related information but this one has
1290.1,7.38,amount of information data on top of
1293.64,8.09,this image or behind this image this one
1297.48,8.28,has semantic integrity okay semantics
1301.73,6.85,so photorealistic visualization is not
1305.76,5.76,always the solution architectural
1308.58,6.27,effective visualization which has mental
1311.52,6.779,integrity is of importance that's the
1314.85,7.699,topic that's the that's the thing I like
1318.299,7.141,to emphasize ok
1322.549,4.541,let's quickly review something about
1325.44,4.68,rendering actually you have learned
1327.09,6.18,rendering aspects before 3d
1330.12,8.58,visualization by computers let's take a
1333.27,6.99,look rendering is all about lights ok ok
1338.7,4.32,take a look the series of very
1340.26,9.48,simplified image how about this one is
1343.02,12.09,this rendering is this rendering no why
1349.74,10.169,why no this is rendering ok this is
1355.11,8.58,rendering in Lion stroke style I told
1359.909,6.931,you rendering what is rendering what is
1363.69,5.7,what is the literal meaning of Brando if
1366.84,6.329,you open dictionary and find out render
1369.39,7.49,render means visual representation by
1373.169,7.441,hand by some type of media whatever so
1376.88,7.6,this is rendering but not photorealistic
1380.61,4.289,it's lion stroke render how about this
1384.48,2.09,one
1384.899,5.361,colorful render
1386.57,7.14,how about this shaded with shadow
1390.26,6.26,casting how about this one entire thing
1393.71,7.65,with texture map how about this one
1396.52,7.18,ray-traced okay so something advanced
1401.36,6.69,but anyway all of those visualizations
1403.7,8.46,are rendering what a realistic is here
1408.05,6.63,but anyway they are still effective
1412.16,6.95,render okay line stroke render and so on
1414.68,6.75,the right text here simply explains you
1419.11,5.67,something about computer rendering
1421.43,9.77,computer rendering three main things
1424.78,6.42,lighting your object camera okay
1431.23,7.3,lighting very important but sketchup
1435.11,6.57,rhino3d max they have their own default
1438.53,6.45,light but the port light is super low
1441.68,5.55,quality that is why you need to place
1444.98,5.13,your own light system because they have
1447.23,4.79,much better quality anyway
1450.11,4.14,you need to know something about light
1452.02,5.08,also you have to know something about
1454.25,4.92,camera it's exactly same to real word
1457.1,6.95,the camera if you are very well known to
1459.17,8.37,DSLR camera it's very good very
1464.05,6.76,applicable to real camera object in 3d
1467.54,5.7,max or some other tools camera is still
1470.81,5.13,very important how about object of
1473.24,5.76,course it's really critical your object
1475.94,7.88,what is diffuse the surface color so
1479.0,6.29,piece material as it seen by your eyes
1483.82,3.85,okay
1485.29,5.44,intensity texture map shadow casting
1487.67,6.96,ambient occlusion lots of sub objects
1490.73,6.96,some things you have to know reflection
1494.63,5.94,refraction caustics lots of things you
1497.69,7.16,need to know how many take a look this
1500.57,9.51,one you have to know those technical
1504.85,9.49,keywords for computer rendering but no
1510.08,7.17,worries not that complicated even if
1514.34,5.68,it's looking complicated if you
1517.25,6.9,understood if you understand the
1520.02,6.72,carnism nothing and another cool news is
1524.15,6.4,this is something about query in
1526.74,4.98,sketchup you have learned last year in
1530.55,4.52,Monterey
1531.72,8.84,there are amount of presets preset means
1535.07,11.16,predefined material defined by whom
1540.56,9.82,student no experts some professionals
1546.23,5.47,already defined to provide you this kind
1550.38,4.98,of thing you don't need to worry about
1551.7,6.69,those things today's lab exercise you
1555.36,6.8,will find out how it is easy to use and
1558.39,9.45,powerful ok take a look this one
1562.16,6.49,lighting source reflection but no
1567.84,6.27,acoustics
1568.65,8.61,this is caustics ok and take a look some
1574.11,4.56,type of ambient occlusion this is ray
1577.26,6.09,tracing ok
1578.67,8.13,there is a ray okay ray penetrating this
1583.35,7.05,glass make another lighting effect like
1586.8,6.71,this reflection from this green color
1590.4,7.89,but there is no Korean effect this is
1593.51,8.37,not ray tracing okay this is Radio City
1598.29,8.82,base there ray tracing technology
1601.88,7.83,applied something like manta ray anyway
1607.11,8.24,as a default we're gonna use manta ray
1609.71,9.49,we use this one okay very powerful
1615.35,6.49,preset renders and very powerful
1619.2,8.01,Autodesk material that is what you're
1621.84,7.47,gonna use today okay okay let's finish
1627.21,6.92,the lecture and move to the lab exercise
1629.31,4.82,installation and click preview
