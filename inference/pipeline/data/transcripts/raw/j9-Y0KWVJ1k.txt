0.4,3.44,meet jonathan
1.839,3.92,he is an investigative journalist who
3.84,3.68,occasionally researches and publishes
5.759,3.76,news articles contrary to the
7.52,4.32,government's ideologies
9.519,4.08,on one such occasion he could not access
11.84,3.52,a global news website dealing with
13.599,3.68,uncensored information
15.36,3.919,it seemed his ip was blocked from
17.279,4.721,visiting the news website
19.279,4.801,with his ip blocked jonathan turned to a
22.0,4.0,popular proxy service that was able to
24.08,4.4,unblock the news website
26.0,3.76,thereby allowing an open internet to all
28.48,3.199,users
29.76,4.639,just like how your friend gives a proxy
31.679,4.72,attendance for you a proxy server serves
34.399,3.84,as a stand-in user to keep the real
36.399,4.48,client private
38.239,4.401,but what is a proxy let's understand
40.879,4.0,it's working by taking a look at how
42.64,4.72,jonathan was able to access geoblock
44.879,5.281,content without much hassle
47.36,5.28,a proxy server acts as a gateway or
50.16,4.399,intermediary server between a user and
52.64,3.759,its destination website
54.559,4.241,when jonathan wasn't able to access the
56.399,4.32,news website he connected his system to
58.8,4.48,a global proxy server
60.719,5.361,once connected the proxy server assigns
63.28,4.8,a new ip address to jonathan's system
66.08,4.48,an ip address of a different country
68.08,4.64,where the website is not censored
70.56,4.16,following this process whenever jonathan
72.72,4.399,visits that website the website
74.72,4.88,administrators see the new ip address
77.119,4.961,assigned via proxy server and sees no
79.6,4.64,reason to deny access to their account
82.08,4.8,once the proxy server is able to access
84.24,5.199,the website it's passed on to jonathan's
86.88,5.199,system via the same channel
89.439,4.481,regarding accessibility to proxy servers
92.079,4.161,you must first set it up on your
93.92,4.32,computer device or network
96.24,4.239,next check the steps required for your
98.24,4.559,computer or network as each operating
100.479,4.881,system has its setup procedures
102.799,5.28,in most cases however setup entails
105.36,4.799,using an automated configuration script
108.079,3.68,there are plenty of free proxy services
110.159,4.0,available on the internet
111.759,4.161,however the safety of such proxies is
114.159,3.841,rarely verified
115.92,3.839,most free proxies will provide an ip
118.0,3.52,address and a relevant port for
119.759,4.161,connection purposes
121.52,4.48,reputed proxy providers like smart proxy
123.92,4.24,and write data that run on subscription
126.0,4.0,models will most likely provide
128.16,3.84,credentials to log into when
130.0,4.4,establishing the connection
132.0,4.4,this extra step acts as authentication
134.4,4.0,that verifies an existing subscription
136.4,4.08,on the proxy provider server
138.4,3.04,unlike free providers that are open to
140.48,3.36,all
141.44,4.72,when it comes to hiding ip addresses
143.84,4.0,many people consider a vpn to be the
146.16,3.84,primary solution
147.84,4.0,while that's true up to some extent
150.0,2.959,there are a few things proxies do
151.84,3.84,differently
152.959,4.56,in the case of vpns extra encryption is
155.68,4.16,also carried out to create a secure
157.519,3.841,tunnel between the user's device and a
159.84,5.039,vpn server
161.36,5.76,a vpn is usually much faster more secure
164.879,4.401,thanks to multiple layers of encryption
167.12,4.72,and has little to no downtime
169.28,4.72,proxies tend to be comparatively unsafe
171.84,4.479,with the service owners having the exact
174.0,4.48,ip address of the end user and having no
176.319,3.681,guarantees regarding down times and
178.48,3.52,reliability
180.0,3.92,if you want to know more about how vpns
182.0,4.08,work do watch how jude could have
183.92,5.52,protected her banking credentials using
186.08,5.36,vpns in our detailed video linked above
189.44,3.6,now let's take a small quiz to check how
191.44,3.6,much we have learned
193.04,4.16,what can a vpn connection provide that a
195.04,4.559,proxy service cannot
197.2,3.119,a new ip address
199.599,2.961,b
200.319,5.441,multiple layers of encryption
202.56,5.92,c access to geoblock content
205.76,4.24,d authentication credentials
208.48,3.28,think about it and leave your answers
210.0,3.519,below in the comments section and three
211.76,3.119,lucky winners will receive amazon gift
213.519,2.961,vouchers
214.879,2.881,what about the benefits of a proxy
216.48,3.119,service though
217.76,4.08,besides allowing access to blocked
219.599,4.64,content proxies can serve as an
221.84,5.039,efficient firewall system they can also
224.239,5.201,filter content from third-party websites
226.879,4.561,allowing control over internet usage
229.44,4.56,in many cases browsing speeds are
231.44,4.24,stabilized compared to vanilla internet
234.0,3.28,thanks to proper optimization on the
235.68,4.08,base proxy server
237.28,4.56,the element of privacy proxies provides
239.76,4.399,is highly lucrative to people looking to
241.84,4.72,hide their actual ip address from as
244.159,4.321,many prying eyes as possible
246.56,4.399,one can easily argue the benefits of
248.48,4.0,using vpns over proxies for added
250.959,4.241,security measures
252.48,5.039,however a few basic tasks don't warrant
255.2,3.92,maximum privacy for the user's side as
257.519,4.081,in other cases
259.12,4.88,for example many consumers worldwide
261.6,4.159,find proxy services more convenient
264.0,4.08,since all major operating systems
265.759,4.801,starting from windows to android allow
268.08,5.119,proxy configuration without the hassle
270.56,4.32,installing new applications as is in the
273.199,3.761,case of a vpn
274.88,4.72,in addition there are services online
276.96,4.959,that function as web proxies allowing
279.6,4.08,users to access blocked content without
281.919,3.761,any setup from their end
283.68,4.0,they can enter the target url and the
285.68,3.36,web proxy will route data from its
287.68,3.36,physical server
289.04,4.8,this level of freedom is hard to come by
291.04,5.599,in the case of vpns making proxies an
293.84,5.28,ideal solution for casual browsing we
296.639,4.881,hope you enjoyed this video if you did a
