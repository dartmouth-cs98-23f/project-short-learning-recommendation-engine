more details later in the video.  "
5.04,5.92,"From the first idea of a quantum computer in 1980 
to today there has been huge growth in the quantum  "
10.96,4.8,"computing industry, especially in the last 10 
years. With dozens of companies and startups  "
15.76,5.12,"spending hundreds of millions of dollars in a 
race to build the world’s best quantum computers.  "
21.76,3.92,"For most of us it’s quite hard to get our 
heads around the world of quantum computing,  "
25.68,5.36,"and a lot of information about it glosses over 
important details. This video aims to clear all  "
31.04,3.28,"this up and if you watch the whole thing you’ll 
have a very good overview of all the different  "
34.32,5.44,"kinds of quantum computing, how they work, and 
why so many people are investing in the quantum  "
39.76,6.8,"computing industry. This is the map of quantum 
computing. Quantum computers solve problems in  "
46.56,4.64,"a different way to the computers we are familiar 
with, which, from now on I’ll be referring to as  "
51.2,5.44,"classical computers. Quantum computers have 
certain advantages over normal computers for  "
56.64,4.96,"certain problems which comes from their ability 
to be in a huge number of states at the same time  "
61.6,5.2,"whereas classical computers can only be in 
one state at a time. To understand this,  "
66.8,6.08,"and to understand how quantum computers work you 
need to understand three things: superposition,  "
72.88,6.56,"entanglement and interference. The building 
blocks of a classical computer are called bits,  "
79.44,5.52,"and the building blocks of a quantum computer are 
called quantum bits, or qubits for short, and they  "
84.96,6.96,"work in fundamentally different ways. A classical 
bit is kind of like a switch that can either be  "
91.92,5.44,"a 0 or a 1 which you are probably already 
familiar with as binary or binary information.  "
98.16,5.76,"When we measure a bit we just get back the state 
that it’s currently in, but we’ll see this isn’t  "
103.92,6.0,"true of qubits. A qubit is more complicated. For 
a useful visualisation you can think of them as  "
109.92,5.68,"an arrow pointing in 3D space. If they point 
up they are in the 0 state and if they point  "
115.6,5.04,"down they are in the 1 state, just like a 
classical bit, but they also have the option to  "
120.64,4.64,"be in a thing called a superposition state which 
is when the arrow points in any other direction.  "
126.16,7.52,"This superposition state is a combination state of 
0 and 1. Now, when you measure a qubit the output  "
133.68,6.8,"it gives will still end up being either a 0 or a 
1, but which one you get depends on a probability  "
140.48,5.76,"which is set by the direction of the arrow. If the 
arrow is pointing more upwards you are more likely  "
146.24,6.56,"to get back a 0 than a 1, and if it is pointing 
downwards you are more likely to get a 1 than a 0,  "
153.68,4.24,"and if it is exactly on the equator 
you’ll get either state with a 50%  "
157.92,6.24,"probability. So that’s the effect of superposition 
explained, now we’ll move on to entanglement.  "
165.68,3.36,"In a classical computer the bits 
are independent from each other.  "
169.04,4.0,"The state of one bit is not influenced 
by the state of any of the other bits.  "
173.68,3.84,"But in quantum computers the qubits can be 
entangled with each other which means they  "
177.52,6.56,"become part of one large quantum state together. 
For an example let’s look at two qubits which are  "
184.08,6.24,"each in different superposition states, but aren’t 
entangled yet. You can see the probabilities next  "
190.32,3.92,"to them, and these probabilities are 
currently independent of each other.  "
194.96,6.16,"But when we entangle them, we have to throw away 
those independent probabilities and calculate a  "
201.12,8.24,"probability distribution of all of the possible 
states we can get out. Either 00, 01, 10, or 11.  "
210.24,4.72,"The important point here is because the qubits 
are entangled, if you change the direction of  "
214.96,8.24,"the arrow on one qubit, it changes the probability 
distribution for the whole system, so the qubits  "
223.2,7.28,"are no longer independent of each other, they are 
all part of the same large state. And this is true  "
230.48,6.4,"no matter how many qubits you have. You’ll also 
note that for one qubit you have a probability  "
236.88,6.16,"distribution over 2 states. For two qubits you 
have a probability distribution over 4 states.  "
243.04,5.76,"For three qubits you have a distribution over 
8 states, and this keeps on doubling each time  "
248.8,6.56,"you add another qubit. In general, a quantum 
computer of n qubits can be in a combination of  "
256.64,6.48,"2^n states. So I’d say this is the core difference 
between classical computers and quantum computers.  "
263.68,5.68,"Classical computers can be in any state you want, 
but can only be in one state at a time, whereas  "
269.36,5.44,"quantum computers can be in a superposition 
of all of those states at the same time. But  "
274.8,5.52,"you may wonder how being in this superposition 
state can be useful in a computer. Well for that  "
280.32,5.44,"we need the final component: interference. 
To explain the effect of interference we  "
285.76,4.8,"need to go back and look at my picture of 
a qubit technically called a Bloch sphere.  "
291.76,4.4,"A qubit doesn’t actually look like this, 
this is just a really nice way of visualising  "
296.16,5.6,"the state of a qubit. In reality the state of 
a qubit is described by a more abstract entity  "
301.76,5.76,"known as a quantum wavefuncion. Wavefunctions 
are the fundamental mathematical description  "
307.52,4.16,"of everything in quantum mechanics which I’ve 
described in more detail in a previous video.  "
312.48,5.04,"When you have many qubits entangled together all 
of their wavefunctions are added together into an  "
317.52,5.12,"overall wavefunction describing the state 
of the quantum computer. This adding  "
322.64,5.44,"together of wavefunctions is the interference 
because, just like with say ripples of water,  "
328.08,5.2,"when we add waves together they can constructively 
interfere and add together to make a bigger wave,  "
333.28,5.68,"or destructively interfere to cancel each 
other out. The overall wavefunction of the  "
338.96,4.32,"quantum computer is what sets the different 
probabilities of the different states,  "
343.28,4.88,"and by changing the states of different qubits 
we can change the probabilities that different  "
348.16,5.44,"states will come out when we measure the quantum 
computer. Remember that even though the quantum  "
353.6,5.04,"computer can be in a superposition of millions 
of states at the same time, when we measure it,  "
358.64,6.32,"we only get a single state out. So when you are 
using a quantum computer to solve a computation  "
364.96,4.8,"problem you need to use constructive interference 
to increase the probability of the correct answer,  "
369.76,4.96,"and use destructive interference to decrease 
the probabilities of the incorrect answers  "
374.72,6.16,"so that when you measure it the correct answer 
will come out. Now how you do this is the realm  "
380.88,5.12,"of quantum algorithms, and the whole motivation 
behind quantum computing is that, theoretically,  "
386.0,4.4,"there are a bunch of problems that you can solve 
on a quantum computer that are thought to be  "
390.4,5.6,"intractable on classical computers. Let’s take a 
look at them. There are many quantum algorithms,  "
396.0,4.72,"too many to describe in this video, so we’ll 
just focus on the most famous and historically  "
400.72,6.48,"important: Shor’s algorithm. If you have two large 
numbers and you multiply them together there is  "
407.2,5.68,"a very fast, efficient, classical algorithm for 
finding the answer. However, if you start with the  "
412.88,5.52,"answer and ask, what are the original numbers that 
multiply together to make this number? It is a lot  "
418.4,5.12,"more difficult. This is known as factorization, 
and these numbers are called factors,  "
423.52,6.08,"and the reason finding them is so hard is because 
the search space of possible factors is so large.  "
429.6,4.48,"And there is no efficient classical algorithm 
for finding the factors of large numbers.  "
435.28,5.2,"For this reason we use this mathematical property 
for internet encryption: secure websites,  "
440.48,5.84,"emails and bank accounts. If you know these 
factors you can easily decrypt the information,  "
446.32,5.28,"but if you don’t you’d need to find them first 
which is intractable on the world’s most powerful  "
451.6,6.16,"computers. Which is why in 1994, when Peter 
Shor published a fast quantum algorithm that can  "
457.76,5.6,"efficiently find the factors of large integers, 
it caused quite the stir. This is the moment  "
463.36,4.48,"that a lot of people started to take the idea 
of quantum computing seriously because it was  "
467.84,6.32,"the first application to a real world problem with 
potentially huge real world security implications.  "
475.36,5.2,"But when I say a ‘fast’ quantum algorithm, 
how fast, and how much faster than a classical  "
480.56,4.56,"computer would it be? To answer these questions 
we need to take a little detour into the world  "
485.12,5.04,"of quantum complexity theory. Quantum 
complexity theory is a subfield of the  "
490.16,5.84,"world of computational complexity theory which 
deals with the categorisation of algorithms,  "
496.0,6.0,"sorting them into bins according to how well they 
run on computers. The categorisation is based on  "
502.0,6.48,"how much harder it is to solve the problem as the 
problem gets larger. Here any problem inside the P  "
508.48,5.68,"box is easy to solve with a classical computer, 
but anything outside it means we don’t have  "
514.16,7.0,"efficient classical algorithms to solve them and 
factoring large numbers is one of these. But there  "
521.16,6.2,"is a box, BQP which is efficient for a quantum 
computer, but not a classical computer. And these  "
527.36,6.08,"are the problems that quantum computers will be 
better than classical computers at solving. As I  "
533.44,5.2,"said, complexity theory looks at how difficult it 
is to solve a problem as the problem gets larger.  "
539.2,5.44,"So if you factorize a number with 8 digits, then 
you add another digit on, how much harder is  "
544.64,5.76,"it to factor the new number compared to the old 
one? Is it twice as hard? Exponentially harder?  "
551.04,6.88,"And what is the trend as you add more and more 
digits? This is called its complexity or scaling,  "
557.92,2.72,"and for factorisation it is exponential. Anything 
with the N in the exponent is exponentially hard.  "
560.64,4.96,"These exponential problems are the problems that 
really screw you over as the problems get bigger,  "
565.6,4.64,"and in the world of computer science you can win 
respect and renown if you find a better algorithm  "
570.24,5.84,"to solve these hardest problems. One example of 
this was Shor’s algorithm which took advantage  "
576.08,4.24,"of the special features of quantum computers 
to create an algorithm that could solve  "
580.32,4.64,"integer factorisation with a scaling much 
better than the best classical algorithm.  "
585.76,5.12,"The best classical algorithm is exponential, 
whereas Shor’s algorithm is polynomial which  "
590.88,4.88,"is a huge deal in the world of complexity theory 
and computer science in general because it turns  "
595.76,6.56,"an intractable problem into a problem that can 
be solved. Solved, that is, if you have a working  "
602.32,6.16,"quantum computer, which is what people are working 
on building. But you don’t need to worry about the  "
608.48,5.2,"security of your bank account yet because today’s 
quantum computers are not able to run Shor’s  "
613.68,6.16,"algorithm on large numbers yet. I’ve estimated 
they would need about a million qubits to do so,  "
619.84,6.0,"but so far the most advanced universal quantum 
computers have around 100. Also, people are  "
625.84,5.28,"working on what’s known as post-quantum encryption 
schemes which don’t use integer factorization,  "
631.68,5.2,"and another technology from the world of quantum 
physics can help here too, a cryptographic scheme  "
636.88,5.28,"known as quantum cryptography. So that 
was a look at just one quantum algorithm,  "
642.16,5.12,"but there are many more each with different levels 
of speedup. Another notable example is Grover’s  "
647.28,5.2,"algorithm which can search unstructured lists of 
data faster than the best classical algorithm.  "
653.44,4.56,"But I should be careful here to make sure I 
don’t mischaracterize classical computers.  "
658.0,4.8,"They are very versatile devices, and there 
is nothing to say that someone may find a  "
662.8,5.44,"very clever classical algorithm that could solve 
the hardest problems like integer factorization  "
668.24,4.72,"more efficiently. People think it is 
very unlikely, but it is not ruled out.  "
673.76,4.48,"Also, there are problems that we can prove are 
impossible to solve on classical computers,  "
678.24,5.6,"called non-computable problems, like the halting 
problem, but these are also impossible to solve  "
683.84,4.64,"on a quantum computer. So computationally 
classical computers and quantum computers  "
688.48,4.72,"are equivalent to each other, the differences 
all come from the algorithms that they can run.  "
694.24,5.52,"You can even simulate a quantum computer on a 
classical computer and vice versa. But simulating  "
699.76,4.736,"a quantum computer on a classical computer gets 
exponentially harder to do the more qubits you  "
704.496,5.424,"are trying to simulate. This is because classical 
computers struggle to simulate quantum systems,  "
710.48,5.36,"but because quantum computers are already quantum 
systems, they don’t have this problem which  "
715.84,6.72,"brings me to my favourite application of quantum 
computers: quantum simulation. Quantum simulation  "
722.56,4.4,"is simulating things like chemical reactions 
or how electrons behave in different materials  "
726.96,6.08,"with a computer. Here quantum computers also have 
an exponential speedup over classical computers  "
733.04,5.44,"because classical computers really struggle to 
simulate quantum systems. Now I’ve made a whole  "
738.48,4.8,"other video about quantum simulation which you 
can watch here, but basically simulating quantum  "
743.28,6.0,"systems with as few as 30 particles is difficult 
even on the world’s most powerful supercomputers.  "
750.32,5.68,"We also can’t do this on quantum computers yet, 
but as they mature a main goal is to simulate  "
756.0,6.16,"larger and larger quantum systems. These include 
areas like the behaviour of exotic materials at  "
762.16,5.76,"low temperatures like understanding what makes 
some materials superconduct, or study important  "
767.92,5.28,"chemical reactions to improve their efficiency, 
one example aims to produce fertiliser in a way  "
773.2,6.24,"that emits way less carbon dioxide as fertiliser 
production contributes to around 2% of global  "
779.44,5.84,"carbon emissions. Other potential applications 
of quantum simulation include, improving solar  "
785.28,6.24,"panels, improving batteries, developing new 
drugs, chemicals or materials for aerospace.  "
792.4,4.24,"In general quantum simulation would mean that we 
would be able to rapidly prototype many different  "
796.64,5.84,"materials inside a quantum computer and test all 
their physical parameters, instead of having to  "
802.48,5.68,"physically make them and test them in a lab which 
is a much more laborious and expensive process.  "
808.88,6.08,"This could be a lot faster and save a huge amount 
of time and money. It is worth reiterating that  "
814.96,4.0,"these are all potential applications of quantum 
computers, because we don’t have any quantum  "
818.96,5.04,"computers that can solve real world problems 
better than our normal computers yet. But these  "
824.0,5.84,"are the kinds of problems quantum computers would 
be well suited to. Other applications outside of  "
829.84,6.16,"quantum simulation are optimization problems, 
machine learning and A.I. Financial modelling,  "
836.0,4.08,"weather forecasting and climate change, which 
I’ll be honest I don’t really understand how  "
840.08,5.6,"this would work, and finally cybersecurity, which 
I think just boils down to shor’s algorithm, which  "
845.68,6.96,"I already described. Now we need to be a little 
careful about the potential of hype here, as a lot  "
852.64,5.52,"of the claims of what quantum computers will be 
good for come from people who are actively raising  "
858.16,6.32,"money to build them and so it makes sense for them 
to piggyback on topical subjects in their pitches.  "
865.36,4.4,"But my take on it is that historically, when a new 
technology has come along, the people of the time  "
869.76,6.24,"aren’t the best at being able to tell what it’s 
going to be used for. For example the people who  "
876.0,7.76,"invented the first computers never dreamed of the 
internet, and all of the things on it. And this is  "
883.76,5.04,"likely to be the same for quantum computers. 
But for me the application that I can really  "
888.8,5.04,"understand the value of is quantum simulation 
which is why I've focused on it in this video.  "
895.04,4.56,"Anyway, so far I’ve described how quantum 
computers work and what problems they can solve.  "
900.24,4.8,"But most of what I’ve talked about so far is 
theoretical. For the rest of the video I want  "
905.04,4.88,"to focus on reality. How are people actually 
building quantum computers, and what can they  "
909.92,5.6,"actually do? Now it’s worth mentioning here 
that some physicists are sceptical that it will  "
915.52,5.52,"ever be possible to build quantum computers at 
the scale needed to solve real world problems,  "
921.04,6.16,"but people working on all of the following 
certainly don’t agree. Now quantum computing  "
927.2,4.96,"is often portrayed as if it is a single thing. But 
inside the world of quantum computers there are  "
932.16,5.12,"a large range of approaches to turning different 
kinds of quantum systems into quantum computers,  "
937.28,5.36,"and there are two layers of nuance I need to talk 
about. First of all are the models of quantum  "
942.64,5.52,"computing: the overall approach to manipulating a 
collection of qubits and then there’s the physical  "
948.16,5.44,"implementations: the actual quantum objects you 
build your qubits from, like a superconducting  "
953.6,5.36,"loop, or individual atoms or photons. We’ll 
start with the models of quantum computing.  "
960.0,4.02,"It is interesting that there are different 
models of quantum computing, because this is  "
964.02,5.26,"not something we see with classical computers. 
Practically all the computers we use today  "
969.28,5.92,"work in the same way, they have a bunch of bits 
holding the binary information of ones and zeros,  "
975.2,4.56,"and we can do operations on these bits 
using logical gates which are basically  "
979.76,6.56,"simple operations that flip a bit, called a 
NOT gate, or compare bits like giving you a 1  "
986.32,6.08,"if two bits are both zero, and a 0 if they 
are anything else this is called a NOR gate.  "
992.4,4.72,"Interestingly you can build a full general 
purpose computer from just bits and NOR gates.  "
998.56,3.52,"In quantum computing there is a similar 
model called gate model, or circuit model  "
1003.36,4.08,"which is the most popular and most 
understood model of quantum computing.  "
1008.32,4.56,"In the circuit model you have your collection of 
qubits which are entangled with each other, and  "
1012.88,5.36,"then you have a bunch of gates which can perform 
operations on small numbers of these qubits  "
1018.24,6.0,"which change the states of the qubits without 
measuring them. A quantum algorithm is built  "
1024.24,6.24,"from a sequence of gates applied to the qubits in 
a certain order, and then a measurement at the end  "
1030.48,4.32,"when you get the final state, which hopefully is 
the answer to the problem you are trying to solve.  "
1036.0,4.8,"Simplistically you can think of these gates as 
operations on the qubits that rotate the arrows  "
1040.8,4.72,"to point in different directions. And these 
operations change the probability of the final  "
1045.52,6.4,"state of each qubit when it is finally measured. 
Now there’s more to this which I don’t have time  "
1051.92,5.52,"to explain here, but if you want to learn more 
about them and do some quantum computing yourself  "
1057.44,4.16,"I highly recommend the educational 
website and YouTube channel called Qiskit.  "
1062.56,4.48,"They are kindly sponsoring this video, and 
honestly they are the best resource for people who  "
1067.04,6.4,"want to learn more about quantum computing and get 
some actual hands-on experience. Basically Qiskit  "
1073.44,5.12,"is a software framework funded by IBM to make it 
easier for people to get into the world of quantum  "
1078.56,6.24,"computing. Everything there is free to access and 
the code is all open source, there is an online  "
1084.8,4.992,"text book which teaches you all the basics, so if 
you don’t have a quantum physics background that  "
1089.792,4.688,"is no problem at all, you can learn everything 
you need there. Their Qiskit YouTube channel is  "
1094.48,4.4,"also full of excellent tutorials and lectures, 
I’ll link to all of this below. And in terms of  "
1098.88,5.68,"quantum algorithms you can run through examples 
of quantum circuits using their online tools.  "
1104.56,3.84,"And if you want to run your own quantum 
programs you can download their open-source  "
1108.4,5.52,"SDK and run them on IBM hardware, either on 
classical simulators of quantum computers, or  "
1113.92,8.08,"on actual real world quantum computers, for free. 
And the SDK is not only tied to IBM hardware. I  "
1122.0,4.48,"used to work at another quantum computing company 
called D-Wave, and there is an interface to their  "
1126.48,5.6,"computers in the SDK as well if you want to learn 
about their approach called quantum annealing and  "
1132.08,4.88,"many other companies are available too. Personally 
I’ve been using their website to learn gate model  "
1136.96,5.12,"quantum computing deeper because my background is 
in quantum annealing and I’m super happy that this  "
1142.08,6.32,"educational resource exists, and is free to use so 
please check that out if you want to dig deeper.  "
1148.4,4.16,"Finally I just want to state that I’ve had 
complete editorial control over the content  "
1152.56,5.92,"of this video and my goal is always to be as 
objective as I can, I just want to make sure you  "
1158.48,4.88,"know that Qiskit is funded by IBM who are building 
quantum computers, and I used to work for D-Wave  "
1163.36,5.12,"who are making other quantum computers, just for 
transparency so you know everyone’s backgrounds.  "
1170.16,4.56,"Right, back to the models of quantum computing 
we’ve already looked at the circuit model,  "
1174.72,5.52,"but closely related to it is measurement based or 
one-way quantum computing which involves setting  "
1180.24,6.32,"up an initial entangled state, and then measuring 
qubits one by one during the computation,  "
1186.56,3.6,"and mathematically this has been shown 
to be equivalent to the circuit model.  "
1191.52,4.0,"Now let’s look at the models I’m most familiar 
with: adiabatic quantum computing and quantum  "
1195.52,5.12,"annealing. Adiabatic quantum computing works 
in a very different way to the circuit model.  "
1200.64,4.88,"In adiabatic quantum computing you are taking 
advantage of one of the fundamental behaviours  "
1205.52,5.2,"in physics, the fact that every system in physics 
always moves towards the minimum energy state.  "
1211.44,5.28,"This is a very general principle, and adiabatic 
quantum computing takes advantage of this by  "
1216.72,4.88,"posing the problems you want solved in such 
a way so that the minimum energy state of the  "
1221.6,5.92,"quantum system is the answer to the problem. 
You can picture this as an energy landscape,  "
1227.52,5.36,"where each point on the landscape is one of the 
potential outputs of the computer. In adiabatic  "
1232.88,4.96,"quantum computing you start off with a flat 
landscape, and gradually introduce the energy  "
1237.84,4.88,"landscape of your problem where the answer to 
your problem is the lowest position on the map.  "
1243.36,3.2,"If you do this slowly enough, the quantum 
computer will always stay in the lowest  "
1246.56,4.48,"energy state so that when you measure it you 
are most likely to get the correct answer.  "
1252.0,4.64,"I should mention that I’m having to simplify 
things a bit here to make it easier to understand,  "
1256.64,4.24,"but it gives you the right picture of what is 
going on. In reality I would need to talk about  "
1260.88,6.4,"Hamiltonian’s and eigenstates but that’s beyond 
the scope of this video. Even though adiabatic  "
1267.28,4.4,"quantum computing is so different to the circuit 
model, they have been shown to be mathematically  "
1271.68,5.04,"equivalent, and problems can be mapped from one 
to the other. And they are both something called  "
1276.72,5.84,"a universal quantum computing scheme which means 
that theoretically they can simulate any quantum  "
1282.56,5.84,"system. Strongly related to adiabatic quantum 
computing is quantum annealing which is not a  "
1288.4,5.36,"universal quantum computing scheme, but works on 
the same principle as adiabatic quantum computing  "
1293.76,4.56,"with the system finding the minimum energy 
state of an energy landscape that you give it.  "
1299.76,4.64,"The reason it is not universal is because it 
doesn’t have the full degrees of freedom to  "
1304.4,5.12,"represent any quantum state, but even with this 
limitation it can still be used to solve certain  "
1309.52,5.36,"energy landscape problems like optimization 
problems and simulate certain quantum systems,  "
1314.88,4.48,"and example is spin glasses which are grids 
of magnetic fields connected to each other.  "
1320.0,4.88,"And quantum annealing is a stepping stone to 
building a universal adiabatic quantum computer.  "
1326.24,4.48,"The last model we are going to look at is called 
topological quantum computing which is currently  "
1330.72,5.12,"the most theoretical model of quantum computing 
because it builds its qubits from an entity in  "
1335.84,6.48,"physics called a Majorana zero-mode quasi-particle 
which is a type of non-abelian anyon.  "
1343.68,6.24,"Which is a bit of a mouthful and obviously 
quite confusing but the important term here is  "
1349.92,6.64,"quasi-particle. Quasi-particles aren’t fundamental 
particles like atoms, electrons or photons,  "
1356.56,5.28,"quasi-particles are created from the collected 
behaviour of many particles together, and end up  "
1361.84,6.4,"having particle-like properties despite not being 
actually real. The clearest example of this is an  "
1368.24,5.92,"electron hole: if you have a grid of electrons 
with a gap in the middle, as the electrons fill  "
1374.16,5.28,"in the gap it looks like this hole moves in 
the opposite direction. This hole isn’t real,  "
1379.44,4.88,"it’s just a hole, but you can treat it like 
a particle with particle-like properties.  "
1385.28,4.56,"In condensed matter physics there are a large 
range of different kinds of quasi-particle and  "
1389.84,5.8,"a Majorana zero-mode quasti-particle is an entity 
that has been theoretically predicted, but there  "
1395.64,4.68,"is still significant debate over whether they’ve 
actually been experimentally observed or not.  "
1401.52,4.56,"Now the reason why physicists are excited about 
this model is because these quasi-particles are  "
1406.08,5.28,"predicted to be a lot more stable than other 
qubits because they are made from parts which  "
1411.36,5.52,"are physically separated from each other. This 
is good because the main source of failure in  "
1416.88,4.48,"a quantum computer is noise, which comes from 
rogue forms of energy creeping into the quantum  "
1421.36,4.4,"computer making the qubits drift away from 
where they should be and causing errors.  "
1426.56,5.28,"But these quasi-particles are special because they 
are protected from the noise by an energy gap.  "
1431.84,5.2,"Basically what this means is it takes a certain 
energy to bring the parts of the Majorana particle  "
1437.04,6.16,"back together, so any perturbations of noise which 
have a lower energy than that energy gap is not  "
1443.2,6.16,"felt by the quasi-particle. This might have been 
a bit confusing, but that’s okay I’m still getting  "
1449.36,4.16,"my head around them too, but that was just the 
best boiled down description I could come up with.  "
1455.52,4.72,"Okay so that rounds up the different models of 
quantum computation, but how do you actually build  "
1460.24,4.88,"them? There are a huge range of different physical 
implementations of quantum computers because  "
1465.12,4.32,"there are so many different quantum systems 
that you could potentially build them from.  "
1470.08,5.6,"The requirements to build a qubit is actually 
fairly simple: all you need is a two state quantum  "
1475.68,5.92,"system when one state will represent 0 and the 
other will represent 1. The most obvious example  "
1481.6,5.28,"of this is the spin of a particle: the spin can 
be up or down, but as we shall see there are many  "
1486.88,5.76,"properties of particles we can use. In fact, there 
are too many for me to list them all, so I’m just  "
1492.64,5.76,"going to focus on the implementations that are the 
most widely used and have been the most successful  "
1498.4,6.32,"so far. But no matter what the approach is, they 
all face a similar set of obstacles which we need  "
1504.72,5.328,"to take a look at first. In general it’s really 
hard to control quantum systems because if you  "
1510.048,4.992,"have got any slight interaction with the outside 
world the information starts leaking away. This  "
1515.04,6.16,"is called decoherence. You want your qubits to be 
entangled with each other, but don’t want them to  "
1521.2,5.36,"be entangled with anything else. But the trouble 
is, your qubits will be made of physical stuff  "
1526.56,3.52,"and you will need other physical stuff 
nearby to control and measure them,  "
1530.64,3.76,"and your qubits are dumb they’ll 
entangle with anything they can. So,  "
1534.4,4.48,"you need to design your qubits very carefully to 
protect them from entangling with the environment.  "
1539.76,4.48,"Then you need to shield your qubits from 
any kind of noise: things like cosmic rays,  "
1544.24,5.84,"or radiation from things like phone calls, or 
heat energy or any other kind of rogue particle.  "
1551.28,5.36,"Unfortunately some amount of decoherence and 
noise is inevitable in any physical system,  "
1556.64,6.32,"and is impossible to eliminate completely. And it 
gets worse the more qubits you have entangled with  "
1562.96,5.36,"each other. This is the big open question still 
hanging over the whole field of quantum computing:  "
1568.32,5.36,"is it ever possible to make a working quantum 
computer with a large number of qubits, or will  "
1573.68,6.56,"decoherence and noise ruin everything? There 
are strong opinions on both sides, and I guess  "
1580.24,6.16,"we won’t know for sure until we actually build 
them. One plan to deal with decoherence and noise  "
1586.4,4.96,"is quantum error correction. This is an error 
correction scheme to make fault-tolerant quantum  "
1591.36,7.36,"computers by using many entangled qubits together 
to represent one noise free qubit. How many  "
1598.72,6.8,"you need depends on how good the qubits are, but 
estimates are in the range of 100 to 1000 physical  "
1605.52,7.6,"qubits to make one fault-tolerant qubit. Which 
is a lot of qubits. And this brings us to another  "
1613.12,6.32,"major obstacle: scalability. For each qubit you 
need to have a bunch of wires to manipulate and  "
1619.44,4.88,"measure it. For a small number of qubits this 
is all manageable, but as the number of qubits  "
1624.32,5.92,"increases the amount of extra stuff you need 
increases linearly, which is a massive engineering  "
1630.24,5.44,"problem. So any quantum computer design needs to 
somehow be able to entangle all of the qubits,  "
1635.68,6.64,"and then control and measure them in a scalable 
way. So those are all the problems with building a  "
1642.32,5.84,"real quantum computer, let’s take a look at the 
different approaches scientists are pursuing.  "
1649.44,5.36,"Superconducting quantum computers are currently 
the most popular approach. A superconducting qubit  "
1654.8,5.44,"is made from superconducting wires with a break 
in the superconductor called a josephson junction.  "
1661.28,4.64,"The most popular type of superconducting 
qubit is called a transmon where the two  "
1665.92,5.44,"level system is encoded in pairs of the 
electric charge moving across the junction,  "
1671.36,5.04,"specifically the frequency at which charges 
oscillate back and forth across the junction.  "
1676.4,4.0,"But there have been other designs that 
use the magnetic flux in a loop of wire,  "
1680.4,5.76,"or the phase across a wire as a two level 
system known as flux qubits or phase qubits.  "
1687.68,4.96,"Physicists have also looked at ways of making 
qubits out of fundamental entities like atoms, or  "
1692.64,5.68,"electrons or photons. Next are quantum dot quantum 
computers or silicon spin quantum computers.  "
1698.88,5.04,"Here I’m using quantum dot quantum computers 
to collect a range of qubit designs built from  "
1703.92,5.12,"semiconductors, things like silicon. Here the 
qubits are made from electrons or even groups  "
1709.04,6.88,"of electrons and the two level system is encoded 
into the spin or charge of the electrons. On the  "
1715.92,4.8,"chip there’s a small area where the electron 
is restricted to is called a quantum dot,  "
1721.28,4.8,"and operations on the qubits are performed through 
voltages on the chip, or microwaves or magnetic  "
1726.08,5.2,"fields. As well as silicon, people have also 
used other semiconducting materials like gallium  "
1731.28,6.56,"arsenide, silicon carbide and also diamond amongst 
others, which all have different properties.  "
1738.96,5.76,"Next we have linear optical quantum computing. 
Optical quantum computers use photons of light  "
1744.72,4.64,"as the qubits and they operate on these 
qubits using optical elements like mirrors,  "
1749.36,5.92,"waveplates and interferometers. At scale this has 
been accomplished by printing these elements into  "
1755.28,7.28,"integrated photonics chips. The two level system 
in an optical quantum computer can have different  "
1762.56,6.24,"designs, either a superposition of different 
paths a single photon takes through the chip,  "
1768.8,6.48,"or a superposition of different numbers of photons 
present in a path. And these can be manipulated by  "
1775.28,7.36,"applying a voltage to a path. Now onto trapped 
ion quantum computers which use charged atoms  "
1782.64,6.0,"as qubits. These atoms are ionised, having a 
missing electron, which makes them electrically  "
1788.64,5.6,"charged and means they can be levitated and 
moved about with electromagnetic fields.  "
1794.24,5.6,"Here the two level state that encodes the qubit 
are two specific energy levels of the atom which  "
1799.84,5.84,"can be manipulated or measured with microwaves 
or laser beams. Next we have colour centre or  "
1805.68,4.8,"nitrogen vacancy quantum computers which are 
similar to trapped ion quantum computers in  "
1810.48,5.28,"that the qubits are made from atoms, but instead 
of being trapped in an electromagnetic field,  "
1815.76,6.08,"they are embedded in a gap of the material like 
nitrogen embedded in diamond or silicon carbide.  "
1822.72,3.12,"There are a few different ways to make 
these, but typically the qubits are  "
1825.84,5.12,"the nuclear spins of the embedded atoms and 
they are entangled together with electrons.  "
1832.48,5.12,"The final approach is called neutral atoms 
in optical lattices. In this approach the  "
1837.6,6.48,"qubits are atoms, and the design uses cold atom 
physics capturing neutral atoms like caesium  "
1844.08,5.44,"into an optical lattice which is a crisscrossed 
arrangement of laser beams, which form energy  "
1849.52,5.84,"wells shaped kind of like an egg box. These atoms 
are cooled down with lasers to a few millionths of  "
1855.36,4.8,"a kelvin and there are a number of ways to encode 
the two level system the qubit is built from:  "
1860.16,5.12,"either the hyperfine energy level of the atom 
or excited states and they can also make use of  "
1865.28,5.28,"Rydberg atoms. And the atoms can be controlled 
and entangled with each other with lasers.  "
1871.84,5.6,"They can also be used as quantum simulators 
as well as quantum computers. In fact a 10,000  "
1877.44,5.2,"atom quantum simulator has been made, but this 
doesn’t look like a universal quantum computer.  "
1883.76,4.88,"These are the main approaches I’m going to cover 
in this video, but it is not an exhaustive list,  "
1888.64,3.84,"some other qubit designs include: 
Electron-on-helium qubit,  "
1892.48,8.08,"Cavity quantum electrodynamics, Magnetic Molecule, 
Molecular Spins, NMR quantum computers. But these  "
1900.56,4.0,"have not been built at the same scale as the 
other approaches I mentioned in more detail.  "
1905.44,4.16,"So that was the map of quantum computing and 
that should give you an excellent overview of the  "
1909.6,4.32,"field. As you can see, there are many different 
approaches to building a quantum computer,  "
1913.92,4.72,"and what is so interesting is that it’s not yet 
clear which approach will win out in the long run.  "
1919.36,4.72,"Now one thing I haven’t covered in this video are 
the companies and startups and which approach they  "
1924.08,5.68,"are using, along with their current best quantum 
computers, and their roadmaps into the future.  "
1930.4,5.36,"But this is what I’ll look at in my next video 
so keep your eyes peeled for that. You don’t  "
1935.76,5.36,"need to subscribe or anything, but check back in a 
couple of weeks if you think you’d be interested.  "

computing is available to buy at my store  "
