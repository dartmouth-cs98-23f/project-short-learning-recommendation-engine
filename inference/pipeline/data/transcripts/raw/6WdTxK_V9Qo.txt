0.0,3.12,so when you think of coding jobs you
1.62,3.36,probably think of really high salaries
3.12,3.48,and awesome work culture but when I got
4.98,3.48,my software engineering job and I
6.6,4.41,realized that not only did I hate the
8.46,4.559,company and the salary was cool
11.01,4.47,[Music]
13.019,4.381,I decided it was time to quit but the
15.48,3.66,problem is that I lived in London one of
17.4,4.02,the most expensive cities in the world
19.14,4.2,so I couldn't really just leave my job
21.42,4.019,without having a new one I know this
23.34,4.14,period was four weeks so I basically had
25.439,3.42,to find a job in that time but the
27.48,3.6,problem is that because I never actually
28.859,4.141,properly marched the data structures and
31.08,4.2,algorithms I realized that there was no
33.0,4.38,way that I could pass the notoriously
35.28,4.2,difficult coding interviews at the big
37.38,4.26,tech companies like Google or meta so
39.48,3.96,somehow I had to figure out a way to
41.64,4.259,master data structures and algorithms
43.44,5.459,and learn to apply them in coding
45.899,4.801,interviews in just four weeks and here's
48.899,4.201,how I did that but the crazy thing is
50.7,5.4,that around week three I discovered this
53.1,4.979,system that basically anyone could apply
56.1,3.66,to basically do the same thing but
58.079,4.581,before I tell you what that was we need
59.76,2.9,to go back to the beginning
63.14,4.42,so I'm not gonna lie I was a bit grumpy
65.82,3.54,about having to learn data structures
67.56,4.14,and algorithms why do we have to learn
69.36,4.38,these random theoretical Concepts just
71.7,3.66,to please some smartass interviews when
73.74,3.84,let's be honest data structures and
75.36,5.28,algorithms have nothing to do with the
77.58,4.679,actual job and I know this because I was
80.64,2.76,a software engineer already at this
82.259,2.941,point
83.4,3.859,so I knew that before I could move
85.2,4.5,forward I had to properly understand
87.259,4.241,what I was even learning because
89.7,3.54,otherwise I would just end up quitting
91.5,3.72,so here's what I discovered after
93.24,3.839,watching tons of useless tutorials that
95.22,3.899,simply skipped to do what with no
97.079,4.201,explanation about the why and the big
99.119,3.721,picture I decided to go back to the
101.28,4.68,beginning and I realized that the reason
102.84,6.18,to learn DSA was hidden in plain sight
105.96,5.64,the entire time and to understand how we
109.02,4.68,need to talk about Legos so let's say we
111.6,4.14,have this Lego house in here in order to
113.7,4.44,build this Lego house you need three
115.74,4.379,things you need to write pieces you need
118.14,4.799,to connect those pieces in the right way
120.119,4.921,and in the right order now I want you to
122.939,4.021,think of this Lego house as sort of like
125.04,3.48,a program and in programming we also
126.96,3.54,have three things we need we have some
128.52,4.38,data that we need to organize in the
130.5,4.56,right way and modify in the right order
132.9,4.14,to get the program that we want just
135.06,3.84,look at this amazing Fireworks program I
137.04,4.08,made in Python we need the right input
138.9,4.26,colors organized in an array and then
141.12,5.04,the right steps aka the right lines of
143.16,4.38,code to make this bad boy into reality I
146.16,4.5,can't believe I just spent two hours
147.54,5.52,making this just for the video
150.66,4.799,so in any program all we really have is
153.06,5.039,the right data organized in the right
155.459,4.741,kind of way AKA a data structure and
158.099,5.521,then applied to to the right lines of
160.2,4.8,code AKA and algorithm to produce a
163.62,4.08,program so in programming literally
165.0,4.68,everything we do is simply data
167.7,4.679,structures and algorithms so when I
169.68,4.74,realized this I was like huh it actually
172.379,3.181,makes sense why we should be learning
174.42,3.06,these things so what I learned about
175.56,4.62,data structures and algorithms is that
177.48,4.68,there's a lot of them like seriously a
180.18,5.0,lot so with only three and a half weeks
182.16,6.12,left I had to get to work
185.18,5.8,so I did what any Noob would do and I
188.28,5.34,picked up a massive textbook to teach me
190.98,4.619,basically all of it which as it turns
193.62,3.96,out was not the most effective way but
195.599,4.5,after falling asleep like literally
197.58,4.5,every single time I opened it I figured
200.099,3.541,that there must be a better way just my
202.08,3.96,next step I picked up this course on
203.64,4.2,Coursera which was a lot better but the
206.04,3.839,problem with this one was that it was
207.84,4.44,teaching a lot of stuff that was meant
209.879,4.741,more for like theoretical computer
212.28,4.44,scientists and like things like this and
214.62,4.5,not for how to pass a Google coding
216.72,4.26,interview in four weeks so while the
219.12,3.72,course was good and I still recommend it
220.98,3.72,if you won a comprehensive understanding
222.84,3.66,it wasn't the right thing for me at this
224.7,3.539,point the thing I did do was zero to
226.5,3.36,Mastery State destruction and algorithms
228.239,3.661,boot camp the only issue with it was
229.86,4.08,that it was in JavaScript whereas I use
231.9,4.08,Python mainly so still had to do a lot
233.94,4.439,of manual work to like figure out
235.98,4.14,everything on my own using Python and
238.379,3.72,the other problem was they didn't have a
240.12,3.899,proper way for me to learn the problem
242.099,4.14,solving patterns that you need to master
244.019,4.261,in order to act really use these
246.239,3.661,Concepts to pass coding interviews but
248.28,3.36,luckily today we actually have a
249.9,3.24,resource like this it's called algo
251.64,3.959,monster and they are also very
253.14,4.92,conveniently today's sponsor when you're
255.599,4.741,presented with 2 000 plus lead call
258.06,4.019,problems it can be quite intimidating
260.34,3.84,but the thing is that almost all of
262.079,3.961,these problems can be condensed into a
264.18,4.079,small set of patterns and principles
266.04,4.08,that you can learn like any other thing
268.259,3.961,and then all you have to do is Master
270.12,4.62,these building blocks to be able to
272.22,4.14,solve all of these thousands of coding
274.74,4.019,problems now I have to figure these
276.36,4.08,things out myself but what I wish I had
278.759,3.72,is something like algo monster which
280.44,3.66,specifically is designed to explain
282.479,3.061,these building blocks and these
284.1,2.94,principles to you they have a
285.54,3.36,step-by-step plan that you can use to
287.04,4.26,meticulously study all of these
288.9,3.9,problem-solving patterns in order and
291.3,3.36,literally if you do study these things
292.8,3.48,you can be so confident that you know
294.66,3.599,absolutely everything you need to pass
296.28,3.78,coding interviews algo monster was
298.259,3.72,designed by a group of Google engineers
300.06,3.78,and is focused on Interactive Learning
301.979,4.021,to ensure that you can Master everything
303.84,3.96,you need to work into any Tech interview
306.0,3.479,with confidence if that sounds
307.8,3.0,interesting to you I will leave my
309.479,2.761,affiliate link Down Below in the
310.8,3.78,description so you can do all of this
312.24,4.32,much more easily than I did at the time
314.58,3.42,so thank you algomonster for sponsoring
316.56,4.4,this video and with that let's continue
318.0,2.96,on with our story
321.44,4.599,so with two weeks left I had learned a
324.12,3.96,lot of things but I hadn't really made a
326.039,3.72,lot of progress at all when it comes to
328.08,3.48,actually solving problems so I realized
329.759,4.201,there was no time for me to study the
331.56,4.02,theory I just had to get into practice I
333.96,3.36,made sure to understand the space and
335.58,3.48,time complexities of some of the most
337.32,3.84,common operations for a lot of common
339.06,3.66,data structures like arrays and linked
341.16,3.42,lists and like another high level when
342.72,4.38,to use one over the other and things
344.58,4.38,like this but besides that I simply try
347.1,3.24,to do as many problems as possible but
348.96,3.06,again the problem is that there's so
350.34,3.84,many problems to solve so how would I
352.02,3.72,just solve the problems that I need to
354.18,3.66,master in order to pass calling
355.74,3.6,interview so 109 and I learned two key
357.84,3.48,things the first thing I learned is that
359.34,3.66,to pass even Google level interviews all
361.32,4.14,you really need to know is how to pass
363.0,3.96,medium level coding interview so I
365.46,3.12,basically now had a benchmark and
366.96,5.28,secondly I stumbled into this golden
368.58,5.76,resource of this famous blind 75 lead
372.24,4.679,code problems list which is basically
374.34,5.16,now become this de facto list of these
376.919,4.681,75 problems that you need to master in
379.5,3.72,order to be able to walk into Google and
381.6,3.48,Facebook and all the big tech companies
383.22,4.199,so I made it my mission to master all of
385.08,4.14,the 75 problems on this list problem is
387.419,4.861,I only had like two weeks left so that I
389.22,5.759,equated two like more than five problems
392.28,4.56,per day which is which is a lot worse
394.979,3.66,yeah because I had been studying so
396.84,3.66,inefficiently before I found that I
398.639,3.541,continuously forgot what I had learned
400.5,4.68,before when I was learning something new
402.18,5.48,even wasn't that something happened out
405.18,2.48,of nowhere
408.12,4.139,so this one had been Loosely applying
410.22,3.9,for some jobs here and there and because
412.259,3.961,when you're a software engineer you get
414.12,4.139,a lot of inbound from LinkedIn anyway I
416.22,4.5,wasn't really expecting anything yet but
418.259,4.56,then one day I got this email it was an
420.72,4.199,invitation to an interview at a tech
422.819,3.72,startup that was not Google but it was
424.919,3.301,exactly the kind of company that I
426.539,3.481,really wanted to work for and I saw that
428.22,3.599,this was the opportunity for me to
430.02,4.019,escape this company that I no longer
431.819,4.681,wanted to work for so I now had to
434.039,4.38,master how to pass a coding interview in
436.5,4.139,literally just two weeks so they myself
438.419,4.381,I was solving a problem after problem
440.639,4.141,and at this point I stumbled upon this
442.8,4.08,new strategy that actually allowed me to
444.78,3.96,master these problems so much faster
446.88,4.879,than I thought was possible and here's
448.74,3.019,what my strategy was
452.0,4.78,step number one solve the problem
454.62,4.079,conceptually I would intentionally
456.78,4.199,completely forget about the code I would
458.699,4.681,literally like take a Lego pieces if
460.979,4.981,that's relevant and try to to solve the
463.38,4.14,problem conceptually and then step two I
465.96,3.66,would try to apply that conceptual
467.52,3.6,understanding into code and in the
469.62,3.78,beginning this is always where I would
471.12,4.799,get stuck because I didn't have the
473.4,4.199,experience to really put these things in
475.919,3.9,the code efficiently so that is why
477.599,4.081,after 30 minutes if I didn't get it yet
479.819,3.66,I would move on to step three which is
481.68,3.9,actually just looking up the answer like
483.479,4.62,guys it's completely fine to look up the
485.58,4.92,answer provided you do step number four
488.099,4.44,which is to understand the solution
490.5,3.96,don't just copy a solution and make it
492.539,4.021,pass on lead code as much as it made you
494.46,3.6,feel good about yourself that is not
496.56,4.139,going to make you learn you need to make
498.06,4.319,sure you understand what the code does
500.699,3.661,other than the future in a similar
502.379,4.021,problem you can apply the same pattern
504.36,3.959,and then after I got the solution as a
506.4,4.019,step five I would try to learn what is
508.319,4.14,the pattern what is the general takeaway
510.419,3.781,that I can take from this problem apply
512.459,4.44,in the future which again I had to do
514.2,5.16,myself but you can do by using algo
516.899,4.26,monster I did this over and over and
519.36,4.859,over and over and over again and truth
521.159,4.861,be told I did not manage to solve all 75
524.219,4.861,problems so the day before the interview
526.02,4.68,I was still not really confident that it
529.08,4.08,was all gonna work out but the thing
530.7,4.74,that I am so glad that I did is I tried
533.16,3.78,before I thought I was ready and I just
535.44,3.12,went in but before I tell you what
536.94,3.899,happened like really at this point it
538.56,5.04,wasn't even about whether I would pass
540.839,4.981,this particular interview or not but I
543.6,4.14,was really proud of the fact that I had
545.82,3.42,managed to do this in such a short
547.74,3.719,amount of time like it made me realize
549.24,4.92,that if I just put my mind to something
551.459,4.56,and if I have a literal deadline where I
554.16,3.78,just have to do something in a certain
556.019,3.901,amount of time I can do pretty much
557.94,3.54,anything like data traction algorithms
559.92,3.06,is one of the hardest things to master
561.48,3.299,when it comes to programming and
562.98,3.9,computer science if I could Master this
564.779,3.06,I could literally Master anything so you
566.88,2.94,wanna know what happened at the
567.839,3.781,interview I passed and I was absolutely
569.82,3.54,ecstatic but I didn't take the job
571.62,3.719,because what I ended up doing instead
573.36,4.5,was quitting my previous job moving to
575.339,4.381,Dubai to do YouTube full time and to
577.86,3.36,build my starter full time because I
579.72,3.239,realized that those were actually the
581.22,4.08,things that I wanted to do anyway but
582.959,4.32,the thing is had I not built this skill
585.3,3.78,to pass these coding interviews I would
587.279,4.201,probably not have had the confidence to
589.08,4.56,quit to pursue my entrepreneurial dreams
591.48,4.38,because now I basically know that I can
593.64,5.1,literally just go and get a coding job
595.86,4.86,at any time whenever I want so yeah it's
598.74,4.14,funny how the universe works sometimes
600.72,4.08,like I guess technically I failed so
602.88,3.899,right now if you want to take action I
604.8,4.08,recommend you go watch this video where
606.779,3.961,I explained to you conceptually what
608.88,3.24,data structures are and after that you
610.74,3.18,can go watch this video where I
612.12,3.96,explained to you what algorithms are so
613.92,4.38,you can basically take the first step in
616.08,5.48,the next hour by just watching these two
618.3,3.26,videos right now
