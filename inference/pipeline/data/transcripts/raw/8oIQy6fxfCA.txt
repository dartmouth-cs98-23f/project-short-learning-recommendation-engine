2.33,5.77,"Physics simulation has revolutionized how
we animate physical phenomena like cloth and fluids."
9.1,4.2,But animating characters remains a manual and tedious process.
13.3,5.33,"Traditional animation techniques tend to 
produce stiff and unresponsive behaviors."
18.63,6.441,"We are using reinforcement learning to develop
more life-like and responsive physically simulated characters."
25.73,4.453,"Our character learns to perform life-like
motions by imitating human motion data,"
30.183,3.22,"such as walking, running, and sword swings."
33.7,4.81,"Our character is put through an intense training
regimen for 10 years in simulation."
38.51,6.403,"Thanks to NVIDIAâ€™s massively parallel GPU
simulator, this just takes 3 days of real world time."
45.31,4.27,The character then learns to perform a large variety of motor skills.
49.58,5.735,"Once the character has been trained, it can use those skills 
that it has learned to perform more complex tasks."
55.52,5.05,"Here, the character is trained to run to a
target object and knock it over."
60.57,5.053,"We can also steer the character to walk in
different directions like you would with a game character."
66.361,6.611,"Our model allows the character to automatically
synthesize life-like responsive behaviors to new situations."
73.46,3.73,We can also control the character using natural language commands.
77.19,5.434,"For example, we can tell the character to
do a shield bash or swing its sword."
84.388,4.249,"We hope this technology will eventually make
animating simulated characters"
88.637,3.432,as easy and seamless as talking to a real actor.
