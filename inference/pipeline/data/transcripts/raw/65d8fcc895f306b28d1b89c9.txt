Machine learning. It's crazy.
Like right now I'm running a machine
learning model that will tell me how bad I
suck at video games in real time. But
honestly I don't think it's very accurate.
Nevermind. It's pretty accurate. So
machine learning, it's hot right now.
It's the future Chad's, G P
T, all the buzzword, you know,
and it's how you ended up watching this
video. Thank you YouTube algorithm.
Love you. And I'm making this
video because I wanna tell you,
you can absolutely learn this
technology. You don't need a degree,
you don't need to be a math genius
and you can learn this all for free.
This video game thing,
you're actually gonna set this up yourself
by the end of this video using all
the crazy machine learning data science
tools in the Oracle Cloud or oci and it
will be completely free thanks to
our sponsor Oracle. And by the way,
you'll find out that if you do wanna
get started with machine learning,
this right here is the best way to start.
Just jump in and stink and do it using
real tools that real data scientists and
machine learning engineers actually use.
I'm telling you about machine learning,
but I'm not a machine learning engineer.
Why should you listen to me? Santiago,
he's a machine learning engineer. In fact,
you know that dog spot from
Boston Dynamics jumps around,
sees things sometimes
piece beer into a cup,
Santiago's on the team
that makes that happen.
It's machine learning and specifically
it's called computer vision. We.
Build computer vision algorithms
to help the robot see the.
World. And also Nacho, he's
a machine learning engineer.
He's the guy who's gonna help you get
set up with that machine learning video
game thing later on.
I created like three workshops and the
idea is to get started on the most basic
concepts that I found out that
are, you know, most important in,
in machine learning.
And they're both gonna help me explain
the wonders of machine learning and how
you can get started down this kind of
crazy and extremely lucrative career path.
I mean talk about future
proof dude. And by the way,
I'm obsessed with machine learning
now. I can't stop playing with it.
So thanks a lot Oracle. But
before we get into that,
let's first define what the junk
even is. Machine learning. Santiago,
what is machine learning?
Machine learning is
Teaching a computer how to learn from
data. Like if you're a software developer,
you're used to uh,
craft a set of rules in order
to accomplish something, right?
Let's say you want to play
tic-tac toe, you will uh,
create rules like if the computer
plays here, I'm gonna play there.
If the other player plays here, right?
You will craft those rules. You will use,
uh, loops and conditions and any
programming, uh, tools that you have.
Mm-hmm  machine learning
is a little bit different and it turns
this on its head. So machine learning
starts with uh, a lot of samples,
right? It's like hey,
this is the temperature over a
year for this particular region.
Can you craft the rules
automatically in order
to predict what the temperature
will be tomorrow? So.
We're teaching a computer to do something
without us explicitly telling it to do
something. If you're like me,
you're like, uh, what ,
what does that mean exactly? What's
the process? How does that work?
Let me give you one quick
example before we dive in.
We'll start by defining our, what
do we want to teach the computer?
And I wanna teach how to
identify a photo of me.
Is this a photo of network chuck?
Yes or no? But how do we do that?
How do we teach it to recognize
me data, the answer's data,
we give it a ton of pictures
of me, different pictures,
me doing this and that.
Then nah, you know,
all kinds of stuff and we'll label it so
it knows it's me and while we're at it,
it also might help to see photos of not
me so we can know what to not look for.
So we'll get a bunch of those of
not me with our data assembled.
We can now train our computer.
He's in training, he's a trainee.
But hold up before we can teach him, we
have to choose how he's going to learn.
And that's called our
machine learning algorithm.
There are a lot out there
doing some crazy math,
but I think the one we want will
be a convolutional neural network.
Now do I know how that works? No.
But do I know that it might be
good for the situation? Yes.
So now we spoon feed the data and the
algorithm will start to learn to start
recognizing the pattern of me.
Every time it sees a beard or
crazy eyes or a man bun, it'll say,
oh you know what? I'm gonna weigh that
feature higher. Or if it doesn't see one,
it'll lower it and it will crunch
through all this data learning me.
And then for good measureable
feed to pictures of not me,
so it knows what to not
look for. And now he's done,
he finished the training data,
he's no longer a trainee.
Now we can test him with testing
data to see how he performs.
Now while this example is very simple,
that's all a machine learning model is,
which is what we just make.
It's a file that's been trained to
recognize certain types of patterns.
Now it could happen that your machine
learning model sucks and its accuracy is
like 10%. That's where being a machine
learning engineer comes into play.
You have to learn what to do to
make that model more accurate.
You have to learn those skills and I'm
gonna show you how to do it right now.
Now according to Santiago,
the first step in learning machine
learning is just to start doing.
It.
I prefer the style of teaching and
learning where you start writing the
deep end and then you
start unpacking things,
breaking down pieces and say, okay,
I need this in order to
understand this particular piece.
Let me go and watch a that
video. Or I need this. Uh,
I do not understand exactly
how the chain rule works.
Let me just pick up this video,
go to YouTube or whatever.
I'm gonna understand that
and then I can move on.
That's the way I would recommend
people to approach this.
So let's just start doing it, shall we?
Let's build a machine learning algorithm
that can tell you how bad you suck at
video games. Check the link below.
Let's get signed up for a free Oracle
cloud account. Oci. And by the way,
signing up for OCI right now means you
get a $300 credit to do whatever you
stink and want with within reason more
than enough to play with this machine
learning stuff. So once
you have your account,
we got three delicious labs to go through.
I created like three
workshops that are uh,
you can do them on your own about
uh, one hour and a half to two hours.
And the idea is to get started on the
most basic concepts that I found out.
And they cover everything
from data extraction,
getting your data ready
like we do with the photos,
to actually building models with
different tools. Psych kittle, learn,
auto glue on even building a neural
network who can say they built a neural
network. You can after this
thing you're doing coffee break.
The first one I'm gonna start
with is data extraction.
The CUS is gonna teach you a ton about
data science as we're walking through
this. Once you got it loaded up,
go ahead and click on start and
then click on run on your tendency,
which just means you're gonna be running
on your own OCI stuff cuz you have free
account.
Now you probably guessed that the video
game we're talking about is League of
Legends. It's kind of a complex game.
It's you playing with four other players
to try and destroy the other player's
base essentially. And there are a
lot of factors that come into play.
What character you choose, the
potions and nerdy stuff you might buy,
how much gold you collect, uh, all
the stuff that happens in the match.
All those are in things that are
important features that might determine if
you're going to win or lose.
And it's in this lab we learn how to
identify those features and feed it into a
machine learning algorithm.
It's kind of crazy.
Now if you are following
along with this lab,
the first thing you wanna do is
set up your infrastructure in oci.
We'll be using a lot of stuff there.
Data science cloud, shell compute,
autonomous js o database. Offer free
offer fun. No, it really is pretty cool.
Oh,
and one more thing you wanna do is you'll
wanna sign up for League of Legends
because you're gonna get an API key to
pull all kinds of data from previous
matches and live matches as
you're playing. It's free,
it's easy just you'll link below, you'll,
you'll follow it along
for the infrastructure.
We're doing all of this deploy
with Terraform and Ansible.
Nacho gives you all the code,
everything in this walkthrough.
You don't have to worry about a
thing, just click, click, click.
You probably won't even know what's
happening half the time and that's fine.
You're just deploying infrastructure.
Just follow directions.
I'm gonna do mine right now.
Now number two,
the next thing you'll want to do to become
a machine learning engineer and that
is to learn why the junk data science.
Like why do we do it? What is it?
What's the process?
The first thing you wanna do is hang out
with nacho nacho's gonna hold your hand
and show you what it's like to actually
tackle a real world machine learning
problem. And using the OCI hands-on labs,
you'll get hands-on to
actually do this yourself.
And this is so cool because you get a
chance to see how a machine learning
engineer thinks how they
approach a problem. Shoot,
he's got five articles detailing it,
every single thing he
does and why he did it.
So if you want to understand the big
what and why of machine learning,
this is like the best place to start.
You're doing it and he's telling you why.
And if you need a bit
more, which I often do,
there is some structure learning out
there for how to understand the whole
machine learning process.
Santiago recommends brilliant. If.
You are like from the
very, very, very beginning,
like you've never seen this, you,
you don't even know where to start,
I would recommend brilliant.
They have a data science
path that's fantastic.
It'll help you to start
thinking like a data scientist.
Now this is for you if you're
very brand new to data science,
like you don't even know
what I'm saying right now.
This is a paid option but according
to Santiago it's fantastic. Like.
I won my eight years old
to take it. Is is that uh,
basic right?
But it's a great star that's gonna
just give you an idea what you need to
face. So I would love that path.
The point of this step is to get you
to understand the whole point of data
science and to start
like a data scientist,
which is important for machine learning,
but also from step one going deep with
our example on Oracle Cloud. Again,
we're looking at the Game
League of Legends and how
we can predict the winner of
a match and it's getting in the mindset
of how to figure that out that makes
this lab so crazy valuable.
Cuz as I mentioned,
league of Legends is kind of complex.
So we'll need to look at the game and
identify features that will affect the
outcome of a match. So things like what
champion you choose, what lane you pick,
how much gold you earn, how many
minions you kill, all kinds of things.
So taking all that and figuring that
stuff out and using machine learning tools
to do it. Don't miss this. Try this out.
And in the first workshop we're actually
learning how to extract that data to
get it from the Riot Games api,
which I'm going to do right now.
Which by the way, what we're doing in
the data extraction process, the lab,
according to Santiago and Nacho,
this is like 70 to 80% of the
machine learning engineer job.
It's getting the data, the
right data, preparing it,
making it look nice and neat so that
when you give it to your machine learning
algorithm, it can learn a lot, learn well.
So right here I'm pulling a bunch of data
down from the API and I'm telling you,
this lab is so cool because
you're learning what it
takes to predict this kind
of thing. So right now we're
collecting historical data,
bunch of data on previous
professional game matches.
So we're pulling all the professional
players and all the matches they've played
in and just so much data about each of
those things with a goal of then giving
that data to an algorithm to crunch
it and figure out who's going to win.
Now while we're pulling in this data,
I think it's important to point out
the third thing you'll need to become a
machine learning engineer.
And that is a little bit of Python and
actually a slightly more than a little,
you'll want an intermediate
level of Python expertise.
If you don't know what Python is,
it's a programming language used
by most of it at this point.
And when it comes to data science and
machine learning, it's the darling.
It's what people use. The how do machine
learning engineers use Python? Well,
in this example right now I'm actually
pulling match information from the Array
games api, but I'm doing that with
Python code. Here's the code right here.
This code is a function that's getting
player information from the Riot Games
api.
Then we had to use more code to pretty
at the data a bit to prepare it for our
machine learning algorithm to where
we end up with something like this.
We didn't get the data like this, we
had to shape it and form it with code.
So I do wanna point out that you
don't have to be a Python expert,
you don't have to develop actual
Python software. But scripting,
doing intermediate things is
something you want to learn.
Now how do you learn it? Ton
of free resources out there.
Paid options are always good. They
give you a structured process,
it pro TV Code Academy.
I also have a Python course freely
available on YouTube and progress.
But you'll learn a ton. And of course
there are other Python videos on YouTube.
Now at this point you do know a
thing YouTube about machine learning,
you've dabbled with it, you know some
Python, so you're pretty dangerous.
Now it's time for Kaggle. Step four,
Santiago recommends a course on Kaggle.
The intro to machine learning. This
course right here, I believe it's free.
You don't even have to log
in, which is kind of crazy.
And this will take you into that
next step of machine learning,
giving you a good base and doing this
will actually help you in the OCI lab.
If we look back at our League
of Legends lab here in oci,
I'm actually gonna access
the data science section.
And if you went through
the data extraction lab,
you already have a data science project
and a League of Legends notebook session
here at our OCI data science environment,
we have a Jupiter notebook which will
give us a a real taste of what being a
machine learning engineer is
actually kinda like. Because again,
this is tools they actually use. Jupiter
notebooks are amazing by the way,
if you've never used them. And we
got it built in right here into oci.
Through this process,
you're gonna get to see use and
experience things like pandas, num pie,
matt plot lib, all things you're gonna
learn through your data science courses.
But in real life and stuff you'll see
what it looks like to split your data into
test and training data
sets. Now step five,
you're not gonna like this one math,
you can't escape it. It is part of this.
The good news is that you don't have
to learn a crazy amount according to
Santiago. All you have to do is
learn high school level math. You.
Have like, let's say
high school, uh, math.
You can get into machine learning,
amica stuff as you need it.
I also asked Nacho,
do you have to go back to college
to learn all this math stuff?
No, I mean I couldn't, um,
disagree more ,
you have a base, but uh,
it's not a hundred percent required.
You don't need a PhD or anything or you
don't need to know deep math to know how
to use something. Now.
If you remember everything from high
school and you took more advanced classes
in high school than I did, you're
probably fine. But if you're like me,
you probably need to go back and brush
up a bit. Statistics, probability,
calculus, those kind of things.
Thankfully there's a ton of stuff
out there to learn math now.
Like there's brilliance, which
has a high school math thing,
 whole course here. You can also
go to Khan Academy. There's YouTube.
Limitless opportunity to learn math.
Do you absolutely need
it for machine learning?
You could probably get by a lot of the
tools you'll use in machine learning.
Abstract away the math. So
you don't necessarily need it,
but it's super helpful to
understand what's happening,
to understand the algorithms
you're using and why use them.
You'll see as you're going through this
League of Legends lab that there's math
involved. Now after you're
brushed up on your math,
now it's time to move on to the big stuff.
Santiago, tell 'em about Andrew Inc.
The machine learning
specialization. By the way,
the previous version of it was
the most popular machine learning
course in the world ever
with millions of enrollments.
He redid that last year. It's
great. He starts from scratch,
but he's not afraid of the math
and you shouldn't be either. So.
This is a machine learning
specialization on Coursera.
It's got three courses and it
is going to make you awesome.
I believe it is free unless you
want a certification, a certificate.
Now at this point, dude,
you've learned a ton about machine
learning and just like a good machine
learning model, it's time to tweak
your model, your head ,
you gotta get better at this.
That's what I'm trying to say.
It's time to hone your
skills. And for that,
there's no better way than just
getting more hands-on experience.
Take all that you've learned and
do it again and again and again.
And one of the best ways is again,
the OCI hands-on labs we
have access to right now.
One thing you'll find out and learning
machine learning is that Nacho has a
really solid example, but he invites
you to tweak it to make it better.
Because as you'll see, the model's
pretty cool. Like it's, it's,
it's pretty accurate, but it could be
better. So you need to figure out, hey,
how can I add more features?
How can I make the data better?
How can I get more data?
Maybe I'll choose a different algorithm
and keep practicing until you get better
results. That's machine learning. And
maybe League of Legends is not your thing.
It certainly wasn't mine before
this. Now I'm kind of addicted.
Take another game. See if they have
an api, pull the data, play with it.
Go crazy. Another option for
practice is Kaggle. Once again,
they have competitions, data science
competitions, which is kind of crazy.
And what this looks like is they'll give
you data sets and they'll say, Hey, uh,
predict things better than all these
other people. And if you can do that,
if you can use your machine learning
skills, there's prize money,
a hundred thousand dollars 60,
like what is this? But anyways,
you'll come back here to start practicing
your data science and machine learning
skills. The cool thing about Kaggle
is they already have the data there.
The hard part most of the time with
machine learning is gathering the data.
They've got the data sets. And I
would say at this point, you know,
machine learning,
you're at a point where you can
start to build your own models,
build your own portfolio, and
start looking for jobs. Who knows,
you might get hired on as a junior
intern, whatever. So these eight steps,
this path will teach you what you need
to know to become a machine learning
engineer. You don't need college,
you don't need to be a math genius.
You can do this.
And even if you don't want to
become a machine learning engineer,
just going through these labs,
which is free from oci, thank you,
Oracle does just let you know
what's out there. Like it or not,
machine learning is the future. And who
knows, you might have a knack for. Now,
back to League of Legends, if you
followed along, you collected your data,
you trained your model,
and set up the model to run locally
on your computer like I am here.
Which by the way, nacho again
has all this as a walkthrough.
He details in GitHub how to do it in
oci. He walks you through every step,
including the local machine
situation. At this point,
you can predict how quickly you're
going to lose this game like I am.
So please actually let me know if you
set this up. I would love to know.
