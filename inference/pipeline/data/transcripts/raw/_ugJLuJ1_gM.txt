1.38,5.82,My Hope Is that quantum computers will
3.54,6.66,help us solve our existential problems
7.2,6.059,but the journey to get to use for
10.2,5.399,quantum computer is a difficult one even
13.259,5.041,though in theory we think we can achieve
15.599,4.561,this doing it in practice is a whole
18.3,3.78,different thing
20.16,4.26,our latest Quantum chip is the most
22.08,4.439,powerful that we've ever made
24.42,3.72,but it still needs to be thousands of
26.519,3.121,times larger in order to solve all the
28.14,4.02,Practical applications that people are
29.64,4.53,excited about the problem is as you make
32.16,5.579,it bigger you get more errors
34.17,5.01,[Music]
37.739,4.441,if you want to program a computer
39.18,4.5,Quantum or non you need the bits to be
42.18,3.66,able to remember the state you put them
43.68,4.8,in but the quantum bits that we have
45.84,5.16,today the qubits are error written
48.48,4.079,they're forgetful fortunately there's a
51.0,4.079,scheme known as Quantum error correction
52.559,4.441,where we can organize Quantum bits in
55.079,4.381,such a way that you can build a bigger
57.0,4.44,less error-prone system
59.46,3.54,Quantum error correction holds this
61.44,3.24,promise to be able to make Quantum
63.0,3.84,Computing scale to these very large
64.68,4.14,systems but no one's ever been able to
66.84,4.319,make the actual system themselves good
68.82,3.839,enough that as you scale it up it
71.159,3.681,reduces the amount of errors that you
72.659,6.241,have
74.84,5.5,in order to make this experiment work a
78.9,4.38,lot of things have to work at the same
80.34,4.8,time the quantum chip all the qubits the
83.28,4.26,fridge and the electronics and the
85.14,3.9,cables and everything and so there's a
87.54,3.24,lot of trial and error that goes into
89.04,2.88,getting all this Hardware working
90.78,3.18,together
91.92,3.72,kept cranking over a period of months
93.96,3.72,and at some point we thought we could
95.64,4.439,really attempt the experiment fully for
97.68,4.259,the first time but then we actually go
100.079,5.281,to run the algorithm their performance
101.939,5.04,was like was terrible the sophistication
105.36,3.66,of the system and what we're trying to
106.979,3.721,do with it we're beyond anything that we
109.02,3.48,had ever done before and so we basically
110.7,3.54,had to develop a new language that we
112.5,4.079,used to make the chip do what we wanted
114.24,4.14,to do and that took a lot of hard work
116.579,4.101,from a lot of very smart and dedicated
118.38,2.3,people
123.02,4.84,communicating with the qubits is pretty
125.88,3.359,tricky because we don't want them to
127.86,3.239,interact with the environment on
129.239,3.541,accident but we do want them to listen
131.099,5.161,to the signal that we're sending to them
132.78,5.58,that's always but if suppose we can
136.26,4.02,support us and it's not just telling the
138.36,4.08,qubits what to do we also need to get
140.28,4.8,information back from the qubits so we
142.44,4.98,can ask What state were you in
145.08,4.739,at the beginning even though the errors
147.42,5.28,were pretty high I felt like you know we
149.819,4.321,can grind this out we can make it happen
152.7,3.36,there were a lot of people on the team
154.14,3.78,that were figuring out new ways to make
156.06,3.84,the operations better new ways to make
157.92,4.58,our decoding better is there another
159.9,5.16,decoder that can get us there maybe
162.5,5.379,after a few months it was definitely
165.06,4.98,like Weighing on us like oh gee maybe
167.879,3.901,this isn't actually going to work I'd
170.04,4.14,certainly say that resilience is strong
171.78,4.08,on this team not everyone has the same
174.18,5.1,approach to solving a particular
175.86,5.64,challenge when progress slows you start
179.28,4.2,to worry you know will we ever get there
181.5,3.72,we're pushing on the experiment we're
183.48,5.24,pushing on it we're pushing on it and
185.22,3.5,then finally it just clicks
191.48,6.46,for the first time we have gone past the
195.3,6.48,break even Point even though we went to
197.94,6.96,a larger array of data qubits the error
201.78,5.099,rate came slightly down we showed that
204.9,4.32,Quantum error correction doesn't only
206.879,5.101,work in theory but that it actually
209.22,4.68,works in practice and what that does is
211.98,3.899,it opens the door towards making very
213.9,5.1,large and Powerful quantum computers in
215.879,4.981,the future I am optimistic that equipped
219.0,3.48,with a quantum computer humans will be
220.86,2.939,able to solve problems that they
222.48,4.14,couldn't otherwise
223.799,4.621,is this palpable confidence on our teams
226.62,4.979,that we will be able to complete our
228.42,3.959,roadmap and build a large useful quantum
231.599,5.06,computer
232.379,4.28,is going to happen not too long from now
