0.24,4.62,you can't have ai without data science
2.8,4.959,or is it the other way around
4.86,5.46,[Music]
7.759,4.0,ai and data science are two very popular
10.32,4.0,buzzwords in it
11.759,4.721,they often work hand in hand but do have
14.32,4.32,differences in enterprise use cases
16.48,3.68,ai refers to a computer's ability to
18.64,3.52,understand learn from
20.16,4.56,and make decisions based on data like
22.16,3.76,humans current ai is limited to where
24.72,3.92,humans can train it
25.92,4.48,with heaps and heaps of data on very
28.64,3.599,very specific topics
30.4,4.24,specifically this is called machine
32.239,2.881,learning data science is a field of
34.64,2.64,study
35.12,3.759,that examines the large data sets with
37.28,3.2,various analytics methods
38.879,3.921,including machine learning and pattern
40.48,3.28,discovery to extract valuable business
42.8,2.72,insights
43.76,3.04,data science can be useful to build
45.52,3.359,recommendation engines
46.8,3.599,predict user behavior make business
48.879,4.0,decisions and more
50.399,4.48,data science is a broad term focusing on
52.879,4.0,algorithms and statistics as well as
54.879,4.721,data processing and interpretation
56.879,4.961,using ai for the prediction automation
59.6,4.16,and pattern discovery part of the field
61.84,3.679,so if a data scientist wanted to improve
63.76,3.76,a specific business process
65.519,3.521,then they would first use data science
67.52,3.84,to gain business intelligence
69.04,4.0,on the process how it could be improved
71.36,4.0,or common errors
73.04,3.04,then they would turn to ai to improve
75.36,2.88,logistics
76.08,3.84,or streamline and automate the process
78.24,3.84,in part or in whole
79.92,4.239,data science is compromised of a highly
82.08,4.079,involved set of statistical models
84.159,3.921,that data scientists manipulate and pull
86.159,2.64,insight from because of the human
88.08,2.8,involvement
88.799,3.201,various types of data and data formats
90.88,3.12,can be used
92.0,4.4,ai on the other hand is not a set of
94.0,2.64,processes it's a computer ability that
96.4,2.16,is
96.64,3.519,ideally self-sustaining to improve or
98.56,4.559,aid business processes
100.159,4.64,so it requires clean labeled data sets
103.119,2.96,that its algorithms can handle
104.799,3.761,independently
106.079,3.121,additionally data science is statistics
108.56,2.48,based
109.2,3.04,constructed to gain the highest level of
111.04,3.52,business intelligence
112.24,4.479,while ai is algorithm-based modeled
114.56,4.48,after human thinking processes
116.719,3.76,it intends to predict future events
119.04,3.52,learn from its own mistakes
120.479,4.401,and lead to more focused processes like
122.56,4.0,machine learning or deep learning
124.88,3.439,machine learning is just one tool for
126.56,3.119,developing new insights
