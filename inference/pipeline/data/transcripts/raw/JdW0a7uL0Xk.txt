second,duration,transcript
5.6,2.96,good morning everyone
9.04,4.639,welcome to the quantum dev room happy to
12.4,4.08,see that many people
13.679,5.36,found a room i want to introduce the
16.48,4.719,first speaker of the day which is tomasz
19.039,4.16,thomas holds two master degrees one in
21.199,3.281,theoretical computer science and one in
23.199,3.281,cyber security
24.48,4.0,and he's one of the co-founders of the
26.48,5.039,quantum open source foundation
28.48,4.239,and the biotech startup protein cure
31.519,3.681,and he has worked with most of the
32.719,4.0,different quantum hardware architectures
35.2,3.12,and deeply believes in the value of
36.719,4.16,combining quantum computing
38.32,7.52,and open source so please welcome the
40.879,4.961,speaker with me
49.52,3.679,all right guys can you can you hear me
51.28,3.84,okay it seems like uh
53.199,3.281,the volume is okay maybe a little bit
55.12,4.32,too loud
56.48,3.36,um all right first of all welcome to the
59.44,3.84,room
59.84,6.639,we ended up having a little bit
63.28,4.64,um of an emergency reshuffling our
66.479,4.561,original room
67.92,6.32,got flooded by here so that's why we're
71.04,6.56,in this bigger space
74.24,6.08,so this is this room is organized by
77.6,5.12,the quantum open source foundation and
80.32,5.36,we are happy to be at fosdem again
82.72,3.36,um last year was our first year being
85.68,3.92,here
86.08,5.999,and we really enjoyed it so
89.6,5.12,we're really happy to be here again this
92.079,5.841,time in uh in a bigger space
94.72,6.88,um we're gonna have 14 speakers today
97.92,6.479,um and we're trying to change the
101.6,3.92,actual kind of theme of the of the room
104.399,3.121,a little bit this year
105.52,3.919,last year we had a lot of speakers from
107.52,3.76,the quattrocoptic industry and
109.439,4.0,we're talking about many different uh
111.28,5.28,quantum computing libraries
113.439,5.04,this year we want to be more dynamic so
116.56,4.8,we're going to have shorter talks
118.479,3.521,the length of talks ranges from 35
121.36,4.0,minutes to
122.0,4.799,25 minutes and we'll also be more
125.36,3.28,project focused so we're going to be
126.799,3.281,speaking more about the
128.64,3.12,projects in the quantum public space
130.08,4.48,that some
131.76,4.8,you know academic groups or individuals
134.56,5.44,work on their
136.56,6.08,free time on or as part of their job
140.0,4.4,and last year we had a little bit of a
142.64,3.679,problem we had capacity of
144.4,3.12,roughly 90 people left i think in in the
146.319,4.801,room and
147.52,5.6,uh durham got really really packed uh we
151.12,3.119,actually nobody could even like leave
153.12,3.119,the room and
154.239,3.201,have any hope of getting back uh
156.239,2.64,throughout the day
157.44,3.76,this year it seems like the situation is
158.879,2.801,going to be a little bit little bit
161.2,3.52,better
161.68,4.48,um but since we since we moved and since
164.72,3.44,many people are still probably coming in
166.16,5.04,because they just just noticed that
168.16,5.12,the room has changed locations uh
171.2,3.52,if you see that people are coming in and
173.28,3.92,they're kind of like waiting on the
174.72,4.08,sidelines and you have seats on on the
177.2,3.119,sides and there's still space in them
178.8,3.359,in the middle you know feel free to kind
180.319,5.041,of compress and go into the
182.159,6.08,middle rows such that people have
185.36,2.879,no space to sit
188.56,4.88,okay and now coming
191.92,4.239,down to actually what i wanted to speak
193.44,5.84,about which is
196.159,4.16,introduction to quantum software
199.28,3.28,development
200.319,3.2,so i'm gonna gonna divide my talk into
202.56,3.039,three parts
203.519,4.0,in the first part i'm gonna talk about
205.599,5.36,some parallels that we can find
207.519,5.761,in quantum computing space right now um
210.959,3.84,with the development of machine learning
213.28,3.2,and how the field of machine learning
214.799,3.681,has developed
216.48,3.2,in a second part um i'm going to give
218.48,3.36,you guys a little
219.68,3.839,primer to quantum computing just a very
221.84,2.479,quick rundown of different architectures
223.519,3.041,and
224.319,3.92,things you need to know about quantum
226.56,5.2,computing to understand
228.239,5.041,um the rest of the day and in the last
231.76,4.24,part
233.28,4.0,okay uh in the last part we're going to
236.0,3.519,speak about a little bit
237.28,3.44,how you guys can help and how you know
239.519,4.0,software engineers and
240.72,3.519,computer scientists fit into the picture
243.519,4.241,and
244.239,6.401,you know how you can you know
247.76,3.92,lead i guess hand out your hand and
250.64,5.2,offer some help to do
251.68,4.16,these projects
255.92,3.68,so success of machine learning really
258.56,4.079,falls down
259.6,4.72,not only to machine learning scientists
262.639,5.201,but also a lot of work that has been
264.32,4.56,done around machine learning to kind of
267.84,4.16,help
268.88,3.92,foster the ease of adoption of of the
272.0,3.199,tools and
272.8,4.88,uh developments that are that are being
275.199,4.241,produced uh one of the big things that
277.68,3.44,helped people develop their own machine
279.44,3.199,learning solutions are machine learning
281.12,3.68,frameworks
282.639,3.12,and here on this slide i list a couple
284.8,3.2,of most
285.759,4.16,popular ones i'm pretty sure that you're
288.0,4.4,familiar with socket learn or
289.919,3.761,tensorflow or at least heard about these
292.4,3.519,libraries and
293.68,3.28,really what these projects do well is
295.919,5.201,that they
296.96,7.92,have really nice well-documented apis
301.12,7.2,tutorials they have a really good
304.88,4.72,basically foundation that they offer to
308.32,3.84,anybody who wants to
309.6,3.76,jump in into the field so if you want to
312.16,3.92,start machine learning you don't
313.36,4.08,need to you know implement your own
316.08,2.0,machine learning algorithms from from
317.44,2.0,scratch
318.08,3.679,in c plus you can rely on all these
319.44,5.36,libraries and existing frameworks to
321.759,4.961,help you build your models and
324.8,5.28,that's something that really helps
326.72,5.52,people to jump into the field
330.08,4.88,then there's a lot of tooling that has
332.24,5.679,been developed that
334.96,4.64,helps people to not only develop their
337.919,2.72,models for example in the case of
339.6,3.439,jupiter notebooks
340.639,3.601,it's a really great collaboration tool
343.039,4.081,but also to
344.24,3.2,you know share their models and deploy
347.12,3.359,them
347.44,6.479,into production so for example the aux
350.479,4.401,framework over here is a tool that helps
353.919,4.161,you
354.88,4.319,you know share your model and provide an
358.08,2.72,inference pipeline
359.199,3.761,no matter what kind of framework you use
360.8,6.72,to actually train
362.96,7.44,the model itself so you can see that
367.52,4.48,once again the theme repeats um you not
370.4,4.799,only need the
372.0,6.4,underlying algorithms but you also
375.199,5.921,need to build a lot of tooling to bring
378.4,5.12,this technology machine learning into
381.12,2.4,the market
383.68,5.519,and last but not least a lot of progress
387.28,5.199,in machine learning has been really
389.199,4.321,fueled by just going for bigger and
392.479,3.44,bigger architectures
393.52,3.28,there's this joke in the community that
395.919,3.761,the bigger
396.8,3.679,is is better and the bigger network
399.68,3.84,solves everything
400.479,3.921,and on this graph on the on the left you
403.52,3.36,can you can see
404.4,4.4,that's a logarithmic plot you can see
406.88,4.319,how the different architectures that uh
408.8,4.08,you know became really successful how
411.199,4.801,much training they
412.88,4.24,um actually need um per day and you can
416.0,4.8,see that for off ago
417.12,8.72,zero reaching like a thousand
420.8,5.04,petaflops seconds per per day so
425.919,4.321,once again basically this development is
428.8,4.56,largely fueled
430.24,4.16,by engineers working on large scale
433.36,2.64,systems
434.4,3.68,on the on the right you can see the
436.0,2.96,pictures of the google tpu tensor
438.08,3.36,processor
438.96,3.84,processing unit um which kind of brings
441.44,2.08,in the hardware engineers into the
442.8,4.08,picture
443.52,5.84,so you can really see that it is a
446.88,3.439,effort of a whole range of diverse
449.36,3.119,backgrounds that is
450.319,5.361,kind of being combined here to produce
452.479,3.201,the successes that we see today
455.84,4.799,all right so now let's kind of
458.88,4.719,you know just keep that in the back of
460.639,7.521,our minds and let's jump into the
463.599,4.561,part of the quantum computing primer
468.56,3.68,um so i guess you guys are here because
471.36,4.0,you have been
472.24,4.48,hearing a lot about quantum computing
475.36,3.679,and
476.72,3.199,yeah there's like all these very um
479.039,2.801,hyped up
479.919,3.361,articles um you know if you scroll
481.84,4.479,through your linkedin feeds
483.28,5.039,um you're gonna see very various um
486.319,3.6,sensational things being written about
488.319,3.121,concocting so
489.919,3.84,yeah the question is how is it going to
491.44,4.72,actually change our lives
493.759,3.761,and even more recently a couple of
496.16,2.56,months ago quantum has
497.52,3.84,sorry google has announced that they
498.72,5.68,have reached this thing called quantum
501.36,4.32,supremacy and uh yeah what does that
504.4,3.519,even mean
505.68,3.199,for us are we going to throw away our
507.919,2.081,regular computers and
508.879,3.52,everybody's going to just have a quantum
510.0,6.0,computer now
512.399,5.76,it's it's unclear so the hype
516.0,3.279,is really really getting higher and
518.159,3.36,higher
519.279,3.44,this is the article that actually
521.519,4.081,announced the
522.719,4.081,quantum supremacy and you can see that
525.6,4.16,they used a
526.8,4.479,qpu with 53 qubits that can occupy a
529.76,5.12,state space of
531.279,6.881,two to the 53 because every qubit can
534.88,4.959,occupy two basis states
538.16,4.56,and you can see that if you were to
539.839,4.801,simulate this uh this
542.72,3.2,problem it would take you according to
544.64,3.6,this estimate
545.92,4.08,10 000 years on a state-of-the-art
548.24,4.96,supercomputer
550.0,6.399,so this this particular transition
553.2,4.8,having demonstrated that we
556.399,3.041,have solved the problem which is not
558.0,4.0,necessarily of
559.44,3.2,practical value right now this will be
562.0,2.0,called
562.64,3.04,but it's it's basically solved on a
564.0,3.6,quantum computer whereas we can't
565.68,3.44,efficiently do it on a classical
567.6,4.56,computer that's what we call
569.12,4.0,um quantum supremacy so it doesn't
572.16,3.84,actually
573.12,3.68,yet mean um that you know quantum
576.0,2.72,computer has
576.8,3.44,surpassed classical computers on a
578.72,4.16,practical problem um
580.24,3.279,and that terminology is uh something
582.88,1.76,that uh
583.519,2.801,you know is being fleshed out in the
584.64,2.4,field actually will zang here in the
586.32,3.44,audience is a
587.04,3.76,nice blog post about uh um you know
589.76,2.96,different
590.8,3.84,terms we should use for achieving
592.72,3.52,advantage and the quantum computing
594.64,5.52,world with quantum computing
596.24,7.52,architectures so yeah
600.16,5.44,right now we are probably i would say
603.76,3.6,somewhere around the peak i don't know
605.6,3.2,how many people in the audience who are
607.36,5.12,familiar with the field to
608.8,5.92,agree with me and we're going to see how
612.48,3.84,the hype cycle evolves and what it's
614.72,4.88,going to do
616.32,4.72,to the field but the impact of quantum
619.6,4.72,computing
621.04,4.479,um really shouldn't be that you know we
624.32,3.84,shouldn't be thinking that it's going to
625.519,5.041,come here and it's going to like
628.16,4.64,replace all the methods that we already
630.56,4.32,have to solve solve problems
632.8,3.12,um rather what we should think about we
634.88,2.88,should think about
635.92,3.039,quantum computing helping us solve more
637.76,3.36,problems
638.959,3.44,so what are the things that quantum
641.12,4.56,computers would be
642.399,4.641,good at well these are problems like
645.68,3.839,optimization problems
647.04,3.84,you know classic example is this
649.519,3.44,traveling salesman
650.88,3.519,problem where you try to find a path
652.959,3.12,through a city
654.399,4.961,that is most efficient and visits all
656.079,5.041,the nodes that you specified for example
659.36,3.28,um you know encryption and cyber
661.12,4.24,security we can
662.64,4.0,hear a lot about quantum computers being
665.36,2.64,thread to our
666.64,3.199,cyber security systems because they're
668.0,3.76,going to break our
669.839,3.281,encryption but we can also use quantum
671.76,4.079,computers to develop better
673.12,4.88,cyber security so um it's it's a
675.839,5.921,two-sided coin
678.0,5.279,and then there's a big subfield of
681.76,2.8,quantum computing called quantum machine
683.279,2.56,learning where people are trying to
684.56,3.519,figure out whether
685.839,3.12,quantum computing can help us solve some
688.079,3.921,of the
688.959,5.44,bottlenecks of you know
692.0,4.959,scaling machine learning that we kind of
694.399,6.88,have have today
696.959,7.041,um then one more i guess
701.279,4.481,near term side um we can use quantum
704.0,4.0,computers to do things that
705.76,3.199,are much closer to what physical systems
708.0,3.92,do so
708.959,3.601,molecular drug design and kind of the
711.92,3.68,design
712.56,4.88,of um of different materials
715.6,3.12,for example using organic batteries or
717.44,4.079,solar cells
718.72,4.32,um are fields where we expect that
721.519,4.721,quantum computing is going to be
723.04,4.32,you know probably providing some kind of
726.24,5.12,advantage sooner than
727.36,7.039,in some in some other domains
731.36,4.159,now that was like a very brief
734.399,3.041,introduction
735.519,3.361,um i'm going to jump in this part of the
737.44,3.92,talk a little bit into different
738.88,5.519,paradigms of quantum computing and
741.36,5.76,how does the kind of feel
744.399,3.521,divide a little bit so there's three
747.12,3.2,major
747.92,3.52,kind of kind of areas there's quantum
750.32,2.639,annealing
751.44,3.04,discrete gate based quantum computing
752.959,2.641,and continuous get based on computing
754.48,4.479,and i'm going to jump into
755.6,4.88,each of these individually
758.959,3.44,all right so in quantum annealing we're
760.48,4.72,trying to find
762.399,4.0,solutions to optimization problems and
765.2,5.12,basically what we do
766.399,6.24,we specify some sort of energy landscape
770.32,4.24,so we define hyper parameters that
772.639,5.041,define the energy landscape
774.56,4.959,and quantum annealing is a process that
777.68,4.88,in the hardware tries to find the
779.519,4.481,minimum energy state of of the system so
782.56,4.0,the system models this
784.0,3.839,landscape that you can see on the left
786.56,4.0,and the minimum energy
787.839,4.24,state would be the deepest valley of of
790.56,3.839,this diagram so
792.079,4.961,um that corresponds to the conformation
794.399,6.321,of these little proteins that has the
797.04,4.64,lowest energy um and the biggest player
800.72,3.919,in the field
801.68,4.48,is the company called d-wave they're a
804.639,2.401,canadian company and have been around
806.16,4.0,for
807.04,4.16,a while now more than decades trying to
810.16,4.08,tackle this uh
811.2,6.319,this problem if you look um
814.24,4.56,at the hardware of quantum annealing um
817.519,1.68,you might have seen the picture on the
818.8,3.279,right
819.199,3.841,that's uh how the d-wave machine looks
822.079,3.76,when it's all
823.04,4.88,uh closed up but in the middle um that's
825.839,4.56,the actual
827.92,3.44,i guess the chandelier of dilution
830.399,2.8,refrigerators
831.36,4.08,and you can see how the temperature is
833.199,5.361,dropping all the way to
835.44,4.88,um the processor on the bottom so the
838.56,3.68,processor itself runs
840.32,3.44,on a temperature that is colder than the
842.24,4.399,temperature in the outer space
843.76,5.92,to minimize all the all the noise and
846.639,3.041,thermal fluctuations
849.839,3.041,here you can see how you know the
852.0,2.32,scaling of
852.88,4.16,the of the size of the chips and the
854.32,4.639,quantum mechanics kind of evolved um
857.04,3.44,it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy
858.959,3.041,the company is trying to
860.48,3.52,achieve this uh this exponential
862.0,4.24,leveling um
864.0,3.68,pace that kind of reflects the moore's
866.24,4.32,law
867.68,3.279,and right now actually even bigger chip
870.56,2.8,is
870.959,4.081,in development so the highest chip on
873.36,5.36,this graph is 2000
875.04,5.68,qubit and i want to keep in mind that
878.72,4.0,between the paradigms the number of
880.72,3.919,qubits or other metrics don't really
882.72,4.0,port so if i say this has 2 thousand
884.639,2.401,qubits and in some other architecture we
886.72,2.64,have
887.04,5.44,on a different number of qubits that's
889.36,5.839,not directly comparable
892.48,4.24,here we can see that basically this is
895.199,3.44,the architecture of the new generation
896.72,4.16,v-wave chip
898.639,3.76,on the left we have this 2000 q called
900.88,3.199,the chimera graph
902.399,3.921,and on the right we have this new
904.079,5.521,topology called pegasus
906.32,6.319,and the lines here really depict the
909.6,4.0,connections between qubits so this kind
912.639,3.921,of kind of
913.6,3.919,deter i guess yeah determines which
916.56,3.279,qubits can actually
917.519,3.521,interact in the equation that specifies
919.839,3.281,the energy landscape
921.04,4.72,so the more connected the better but
923.12,6.399,making more connected graphs is
925.76,6.4,more difficult in hardware
929.519,3.281,so this is how you specify the energy
932.16,3.44,landscape
932.8,4.08,it's a what we call quadratic
935.6,3.44,unconstrained binary optimization
936.88,4.639,problem because the
939.04,4.0,variables here are quadratic oh sorry
941.519,5.041,binary and the terms are
943.04,5.76,at most quadratic um that's all you
946.56,5.12,really need to know um
948.8,4.08,i don't need to like deep dive deep into
951.68,3.599,the details how we specify
952.88,3.759,that equation but it's actually not that
955.279,2.881,difficult it's basically we need to
956.639,3.521,encode the constraints
958.16,3.119,of your problem into some sort of energy
960.16,4.64,penalties
961.279,5.041,that if um are violated
964.8,3.279,they no longer correspond to the lowest
966.32,4.4,energy solution of
968.079,3.921,that equation um you can see that the
970.72,2.799,things aren't perfect here
972.0,4.0,on this graph you can see that some
973.519,4.56,qubits are missing or some links
976.0,3.68,are missing and there's a bunch of like
978.079,2.961,more lower level problems
979.68,3.04,connected with you know programming
981.04,3.84,these devices because
982.72,3.919,um we have to deal with things like
984.88,4.8,finite resolutions we're going from
986.639,4.64,digital to to analog and
989.68,3.04,we might not be able to represent you
991.279,3.281,know for example floating point numbers
992.72,4.88,with the precision we would like
994.56,4.719,to have so there are things that
997.6,3.2,you know kind of coming to the picture
999.279,2.8,that you might not be used to because
1000.8,3.92,you're simply dealing with a
1002.079,4.0,technology that is more lower level than
1004.72,4.119,you know your regular
1006.079,4.88,um classical programming language these
1008.839,3.641,days
1010.959,3.041,here is an example of how you for
1012.48,5.359,example would
1014.0,5.759,um specify a problem so this encodes the
1017.839,5.68,energy landscape of a checkerboard
1019.759,7.2,and its lowest energy state is basically
1023.519,6.481,a state where the neighboring qubits are
1026.959,6.96,alternating in value so there you go 0 1
1030.0,7.039,0 1 or 1 0 1 0 and you do that by
1033.919,4.081,imposing a very simple simple matrix of
1037.039,3.52,penalties here
1038.0,3.439,that is defined there over with the j
1040.559,2.4,matrix
1041.439,3.76,and it's really only like a couple of
1042.959,5.36,lines of code using the d-wave uh
1045.199,3.12,standard development libraries
1048.72,3.68,so the workflow in a quantum annealing
1050.16,4.08,world is really you define a problem
1052.4,4.0,you figure out how to you know encode
1054.24,4.64,that problem as this equation
1056.4,3.12,and as i mentioned you basically do that
1058.88,2.24,via
1059.52,3.279,imposing different penalties for
1061.12,3.12,situations that you don't like so for
1062.799,3.76,example in the previous case
1064.24,4.0,i would impose penalties for two qubits
1066.559,3.201,being the same value
1068.24,3.12,once you have the equation you try to in
1069.76,2.72,what we call embedded on the graph so
1071.36,2.48,you're going to make sure that the
1072.48,3.6,qubits that are
1073.84,3.36,talking to each other in your equation
1076.08,4.24,can talk
1077.2,3.839,to each other on a hardware and then you
1080.32,2.239,just solve
1081.039,3.361,the problem on the hardware and you read
1082.559,3.601,out your solution
1084.4,3.04,and if you want to guys play with it
1086.16,3.28,there's d-wave leap
1087.44,3.52,it's a platformer out of d-wave that you
1089.44,4.96,can have one minute
1090.96,6.32,of free qp time to play with
1094.4,4.56,and some further resources um for you
1097.28,4.639,guys to look at
1098.96,3.36,okay the universal computing um i'm
1101.919,3.681,gonna
1102.32,4.08,speed up things a little bit um here we
1105.6,3.36,are constructing
1106.4,3.12,so-called quantum circuits so the big
1108.96,4.32,players
1109.52,4.88,are ibm google righty
1113.28,3.84,and they're each are developing their
1114.4,5.519,own respective libraries
1117.12,4.96,that you know you can use to specify
1119.919,4.961,quantum circuits and
1122.08,3.68,run down the results uh fundamental
1124.88,3.28,building block of
1125.76,3.36,quantum computing in this paradigm is
1128.16,3.04,qubit
1129.12,3.52,and this is something that you might
1131.2,3.68,have seen previously
1132.64,4.0,um if not it's completely fine qubit is
1134.88,4.4,basically specified by
1136.64,3.36,two amplitudes that's alpha and beta in
1139.28,3.759,this
1140.0,5.84,equation and
1143.039,3.601,those squared specify the probabilities
1145.84,3.92,of sampling
1146.64,7.039,each of these basis states either 0
1149.76,5.6,or 1. and
1153.679,3.841,basically in order to program the device
1155.36,4.559,you construct a circuit so very
1157.52,3.92,much similar to you know classical
1159.919,4.321,circuit logic you
1161.44,4.4,specify quantum circuits uh you you
1164.24,4.799,basically have either
1165.84,6.32,operations that touch one two or
1169.039,5.041,multiple qubits and
1172.16,3.759,by imposing those operations you alter
1174.08,3.44,the state of the system we alter what we
1175.919,3.441,call the wave function
1177.52,3.2,and at the end of the computation you
1179.36,5.04,just read out the
1180.72,4.959,the result so for example one of the
1184.4,1.76,things that you can do you can basically
1185.679,2.801,introduce
1186.16,4.48,entanglement it's one of the usual
1188.48,4.88,building blocks of
1190.64,4.159,quantum algorithms and you do that using
1193.36,3.84,a hadamard gate
1194.799,3.041,hadamard gate is nothing else a certain
1197.2,3.28,rotation
1197.84,3.76,of uh of the qubit because we can see
1200.48,4.4,the result of the rotation
1201.6,5.199,um here for two basis states another
1204.88,4.08,gate that you can use is a c not gate
1206.799,3.76,and if you were to combine the two you
1208.96,4.4,can actually
1210.559,4.161,reach this combination of states which
1213.36,3.92,kind of
1214.72,4.4,imposes that we can only get zero zero
1217.28,4.399,or one one out of the system
1219.12,3.12,which we call um entangled state or
1221.679,4.24,maximum
1222.24,7.52,integral state um so we would do this
1225.919,5.601,in uh um using the we get this library
1229.76,4.64,as described over here so you can again
1231.52,5.92,see that you know it's a fairly simple
1234.4,3.759,way to specify the circuit actually it
1237.44,2.88,generates
1238.159,3.441,a circuit in a language called quill
1240.32,3.68,which is uh on the
1241.6,3.68,on the right um so it's very much like
1244.0,4.96,assembler like
1245.28,6.08,in this particular sense
1248.96,3.52,and here the mo the workflow is again
1251.36,2.88,very similar
1252.48,3.52,um you go from your professional problem
1254.24,2.799,then you you know figure out the quantum
1256.0,3.44,algorithm
1257.039,3.601,you generate a quantum circuit for that
1259.44,2.479,algorithm and
1260.64,3.279,you compile it to the hardware so the
1261.919,3.921,hardware can only use certain
1263.919,3.361,operations so there's a step called
1265.84,3.92,compilation where you
1267.28,4.72,make sure that the gates that you're
1269.76,3.76,using are actually implemented on the
1272.0,3.12,on the hardware and then you run your
1273.52,3.68,thing on the quantum processor and read
1275.12,4.64,out the result
1277.2,4.08,okay another paradigm and the last one
1279.76,3.84,that i want to talk about this
1281.28,3.2,continuous variable quantum computing
1283.6,3.36,and here
1284.48,3.92,instead of having these you know two
1286.96,4.16,basis states you have a
1288.4,4.159,continuum of basis states so instead of
1291.12,2.799,qubit we call the
1292.559,3.041,computational building block the queue
1293.919,3.441,mode
1295.6,3.04,and uh for example one of the
1297.36,4.48,applications or one of the
1298.64,6.0,kind of building blocks of these systems
1301.84,4.24,is quantum boson sampling that you can
1304.64,3.12,use to
1306.08,3.2,you know sample from complex pros or
1307.76,3.279,distributions um
1309.28,4.96,it's well suited for graph hormones for
1311.039,6.321,example um we wrote a paper on using
1314.24,4.96,gaussian blossom sampling for certain
1317.36,3.679,molecule docking problems so that was
1319.2,2.56,basically trying to find maximum clicks
1321.039,2.88,and
1321.76,3.84,certain certain graphs that we generated
1323.919,3.681,so it's it's really
1325.6,3.6,you can see that you can have to combine
1327.6,3.28,you know knowledge from
1329.2,3.599,quantum computing with knowledge from
1330.88,4.799,computer science in order to
1332.799,3.521,achieve useful results and the biggest
1335.679,3.281,player
1336.32,4.16,um in this field is xanadu and actually
1338.96,4.16,we have a speaker from xander here
1340.48,4.24,today so he's going to tell you more
1343.12,4.08,about
1344.72,3.12,this domain more resources if you guys
1347.2,4.56,are interested
1347.84,6.079,you can find us in a slide deck so
1351.76,3.84,at the end of the talk i want to kind of
1353.919,4.481,talk about a little bit about
1355.6,3.76,how can you become part of this and uh
1358.4,3.279,you know what are
1359.36,3.04,the things that you can actually do to
1361.679,3.761,um
1362.4,4.399,you know help the field out
1365.44,4.64,the nice thing about quantum computing
1366.799,6.401,is that um there's a big push
1370.08,4.959,um in the community for the things to
1373.2,3.359,happen in the open source way
1375.039,4.081,not only the research itself but also
1376.559,4.721,like all the underlying building blocks
1379.12,3.039,um the libraries are available open
1381.28,3.68,source
1382.159,4.321,and uh you know it really helps
1384.96,6.32,reproducibility but also
1386.48,4.8,it helps more people join the field
1391.44,4.16,so like all of these not all these many
1393.52,5.6,of these quantum hardware providers
1395.6,6.8,are also providing open source
1399.12,6.0,libraries to program their devices
1402.4,5.68,or play with their quantum virtual
1405.12,4.799,machines quantum simulators
1408.08,3.599,and that is that is really nice for us
1409.919,4.921,to be able to
1411.679,5.601,you know spread the knowledge
1414.84,5.079,the kind of implicit thing about the
1417.28,4.56,field is that it it comes from
1419.919,3.841,you know academia to to a degree and
1421.84,3.68,many people working on these open source
1423.76,4.48,projects are scientists
1425.52,5.2,um and they're doing a great job but
1428.24,3.679,many of them are not software engineers
1430.72,4.079,by training
1431.919,3.281,and there's a huge potential in um you
1434.799,2.801,know
1435.2,4.0,more of software engineers being
1437.6,4.8,involved in helping
1439.2,5.359,you know scale and design apis and and
1442.4,4.32,just build this system in a way that
1444.559,5.041,follow the best practices of
1446.72,2.88,software engineering
1450.0,6.32,so there's a huge list
1453.279,4.0,of projects on our website the links are
1456.32,4.32,on the right
1457.279,5.76,that you can use to see a um
1460.64,3.039,you know quite exhausting list of
1463.039,1.921,different
1463.679,3.761,projects in different different areas
1464.96,5.12,and i want to mention some of those here
1467.44,3.839,so these are things like quantum
1470.08,2.24,compilers or quantum circuit
1471.279,3.841,optimization
1472.32,4.64,where you try to make sure that you
1475.12,3.28,modify the circuit in such a way that
1476.96,3.76,you let's say optimize the number of
1478.4,4.639,gates and at the same time you produce
1480.72,4.959,the same kind of a result
1483.039,4.24,at the end there are things like
1485.679,2.641,development of control systems so we're
1487.279,4.481,actually going to have a speaker
1488.32,5.12,today speaking speaking about um a open
1491.76,3.36,source project for control systems and
1493.44,5.119,and quantum computing
1495.12,6.0,um we have things like quantum games or
1498.559,3.681,ide tools visualization tools so a lot
1501.12,2.96,of these things that need to be
1502.24,4.08,developed now we can draw the parallels
1504.08,5.04,that i was speaking about
1506.32,4.719,in the case of machine learning um a lot
1509.12,4.88,of work needs to be done
1511.039,3.52,for us to be able to like do research
1514.0,2.64,and
1514.559,3.441,really develop this field further and
1516.64,4.159,also that work
1518.0,3.76,is um you know fundamental software
1520.799,4.801,engineering
1521.76,5.84,uh basically waiting to be fulfilled
