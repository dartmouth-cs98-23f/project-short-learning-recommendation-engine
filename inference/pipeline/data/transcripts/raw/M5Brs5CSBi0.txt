5.18,6.49,quantum computing has demonstrated a lot
9.09,4.469,of exciting potential to accelerate
11.67,4.379,machine learning and data science
13.559,7.611,applications in the future there are
16.049,10.98,already a number of known speed ups of
21.17,8.38,classical algorithms the the exciting
27.029,6.181,area that I see though is not only the
29.55,6.48,speed up but of looking at problems in
33.21,4.919,an entirely different way quantum
36.03,8.16,computing is probabilistic by nature
38.129,8.191,which Maps very well to machine learning
44.19,6.42,problems because we're not making a
46.32,7.02,model that is the exact best fit for the
50.61,6.269,data we want to do one that is a
53.34,6.18,probabilistic fit for future data one
56.879,5.61,that generalizes well to future data and
59.52,5.58,so quantum computing allows us to get
62.489,4.95,multiple probabilistic solutions that we
65.1,5.55,can then examine and look at the one
67.439,8.131,that has the best utility to actually
70.65,7.289,deploy as a model so that the speed-up
75.57,4.17,potential is immense I'm excited about
77.939,4.021,what I can do and
79.74,6.75,and a number of other applications but
81.96,7.65,also again developing algorithms and
86.49,7.32,methods that are quantum specific rather
89.61,6.56,than just improving known classical
93.81,2.36,methods
