In this video, we uncover the secrets behind 
the modern databases we know and love.
From MySQL to Redis to Cassandra,  
we break down the 8 essential data 
structures that make it all possible.
Let’s dive right in.
First up is the skip list.
A skip list is a probabilistic data structure 
that is used to implement a sorted map or set.
It is an alternative to a balanced tree.
This allows for efficient search, 
insertion, and deletion operations.
In an in-memory database like 
Redis, a Skip List is used to  
implement the ordered data structures 
such as Sorted Sets and Sorted Lists.
It allows for fast lookups, range 
queries, and other operations.
Next is the hash index.
A Hash Index, also known as a Hash 
Table, is used to efficiently map  
keys to values by using a hash function 
to generate a hash value for each key.
The hash value is used to quickly 
locate the value in the table,  
allowing for fast lookups, 
insertions, and deletions.
A hash index is ubiquitous.
It is obviously used to implement 
hash data structures like Hashes  
in Redis, but it is also widely used 
internally in all kinds of databases.
The next two data structures go hand in hand.
They are SSTable and LSM Tree.
SSTable, or Sorted Strings Table, is used 
to store data on disk in sorted order.
It is a file-based data structure that 
is used to store large amounts of data  
in a highly compressed and efficient format.
SSTable is a core component of the LSM tree.
The other core component is a MemTable.
Memtable is an in-memory data 
structure that stores recent writes.
SSTable and Memtable work together to 
handle a high volume of write operations.
We have an entire video dedicated to the LSM tree.
Check out the description 
below for a link to that video.
LSM-Tree is the backbone 
of popular NoSQL databases  
such as Apache Cassandra, RocksDB, and LevelDB.
Next up is the B-tree family.
We include the B+tree in this.
The B-Tree family of data structures is used to  
efficiently store and retrieve 
large amounts of data on disk.
B-Tree is a balanced tree where each node can 
have multiple children and keeps data sorted.
B+ Tree is a specific type of B-Tree where all  
data is stored in leaf nodes and 
internal nodes only hold keys."
They are widely used in databases such as MySQL,  
Postgres, and Oracle to handle 
large amounts of on-disk data.
Next is an inverted index.
An Inverted Index is used to efficiently search  
and retrieve data from a large 
collection of text documents.
It creates a mapping of words to 
the documents in which they appear.
The index is "inverted" because it 
maps the words to the documents,  
rather than the other way around.
Inverted indexes are commonly used in 
document search engines like ElasticSearch.
Next one is the suffix tree.
It is used in databases for 
efficient text searching.
It quickly finds all occurrences of a search 
term within a large collection of documents.
The last data structure we’ll 
discuss is somewhat specialized.
It is an R-tree.
An R-Tree is a spatial index data 
structure that organizes data based  
on their geometric boundaries 
such as rectangles or polygons.
It is used to efficiently store and 
retrieve spatial data in a database.
It allows for fast spatial queries and is  
widely used in spatial databases like 
PostGIS, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch.
This concludes our discussion of the 8 data 
structures that power modern databases.
This is by no means an exhaustive list.

would like us to discuss in the future.
