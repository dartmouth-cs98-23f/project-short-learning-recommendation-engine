0.88,4.0,most programming languages developed in
2.8,4.24,the last 30 years are what are called
4.88,4.32,object oriented languages now this
7.04,4.4,wasn't always the way my first
9.2,5.04,programming job over 25 years ago was
11.44,5.52,writing assembly language fortran and
14.24,4.799,cobol on icl mainframes now these
16.96,4.079,languages were not object oriented
19.039,4.561,languages they were instead straight
21.039,5.761,procedural languages where the program
23.6,5.28,really is written as one long procedure
26.8,4.0,even though it might contain functions
28.88,4.16,and subroutines to make it more modular
30.8,5.12,and maintainable it's really a long
33.04,5.519,piece of code combining data and logic
35.92,4.799,all mixed in together now in an object
38.559,4.721,oriented language this program would
40.719,4.801,instead be split apart into
43.28,4.88,self-contained objects almost like
45.52,5.039,having several mini programs
48.16,4.96,each object is representing a different
50.559,5.601,part of the application and each object
53.12,6.0,contains its own data and its own logic
56.16,4.879,and they communicate between themselves
59.12,5.039,now if that sounds like it could be a
61.039,6.001,little bit confusing the idea here is
64.159,5.201,that these objects represent the way you
67.04,4.8,would talk and think about the actual
69.36,4.96,problem it's meant to make thinking
71.84,4.88,about your program easier the objects
74.32,4.799,don't represent mysterious abstract
76.72,4.96,ideas they first represent things like
79.119,4.801,employees and images bank accounts
81.68,4.799,player objects and car objects whatever
83.92,5.6,actually exists in your program
86.479,5.201,so object orientation is an idea and
89.52,4.48,it's an idea that is supported in many
91.68,4.56,languages and for you it's a shift to
94.0,5.28,thinking about the objects in your
96.24,5.36,program and not just the process and
99.28,4.96,while object oriented programming can
101.6,4.479,bring a lot of jargon to the table there
104.24,3.68,are really only a couple of terms we
106.079,4.0,need to be comfortable with to move
107.92,4.08,forward with it and the first two terms
110.079,4.72,we need to understand is the difference
112.0,5.28,between a class and an object and these
114.799,5.121,two terms go hand in hand with object
117.28,4.799,oriented languages a class
119.92,4.64,is a blueprint it's an idea it's a
122.079,5.201,description it's a definition it
124.56,4.399,describes what something is but it isn't
127.28,4.56,the thing itself it's a well-defined
128.959,4.961,idea like say a blueprint for a house
131.84,4.16,now classes will exist for different
133.92,4.399,parts of your program say if you are
136.0,4.4,writing a restaurant review website you
138.319,4.881,might create classes that represent a
140.4,5.6,restaurant and a review or a user
143.2,5.2,classes could also represent visual
146.0,5.12,parts of your program things like text
148.4,5.119,box and button and window and they can
151.12,4.72,also represent invisible things like
153.519,5.281,dates and times now anything that can be
155.84,5.92,a well-defined idea a lot of languages
158.8,5.12,come with many classes already defined
161.76,5.6,even advanced things like video player
163.92,6.959,classes and you can also define your own
167.36,7.36,now all classes describe and define two
170.879,5.841,things attributes and behavior what are
174.72,5.04,some things characteristics it's
176.72,4.239,attributes and what can it do what's its
179.76,2.64,behavior
180.959,4.0,so in this case let's say we're
182.4,4.64,describing a class to describe a person
184.959,5.521,we might say that the person attributes
187.04,5.76,our name height weight gender and age
190.48,4.96,whereas the person's behavior is walk
192.8,4.24,run jump speak sleep think about it this
195.44,3.6,way that the attributes are really your
197.04,5.119,data your variables
199.04,4.4,and the behavior is what can you do your
202.159,3.761,functions
203.44,4.079,actually attributes and behavior in most
205.92,3.679,object-oriented languages are actually
207.519,3.36,described with other names which is
209.599,3.841,properties
210.879,4.72,and methods these are the most common
213.44,5.439,ways of describing these
215.599,5.521,but the class is describing these things
218.879,4.881,in abstract and what i mean by that is
221.12,4.64,it says that a person has a name and it
223.76,4.72,has a height but it doesn't say what the
225.76,4.0,name is because the class is just the
228.48,3.52,description
229.76,4.72,of something but just like there's no
232.0,4.48,point creating a blueprint if you never
234.48,4.479,intend to make a house there's no point
236.48,4.8,defining a class unless you're going to
238.959,4.881,make an object so that's the
241.28,5.679,relationship between the two the class
243.84,6.88,is the idea and the object is the thing
246.959,7.121,itself we create objects based on the
250.72,6.4,class like creating a house based on the
254.08,5.92,blueprint not only that but you can
257.12,4.959,create multiple objects based on one
260.0,4.56,class in the same way you could create
262.079,5.201,multiple houses based on one single
264.56,4.88,blueprint now while there is a lot of
267.28,3.56,jargon associated with object
269.44,4.4,orientation
270.84,6.04,encapsulation is the key idea this is
273.84,6.0,the idea that classes are self-contained
276.88,5.52,units that represent both the data and
279.84,5.28,the code that works on that data that we
282.4,6.16,take our properties and our methods and
285.12,5.84,we box them up we encapsulate them now
288.56,4.32,javascript is an object-oriented
290.96,4.0,language although it is quite casual
292.88,4.72,with it there are some other languages
294.96,4.4,where object orientation is very formal
297.6,3.68,and you can do very little without
299.36,5.279,thinking deeply about classes and
301.28,6.0,objects so while some languages like c
304.639,6.161,are not at all object-oriented if you're
307.28,6.72,working in java c-sharp ruby python
310.8,5.44,vb.net objective-c you can't avoid
314.0,5.72,object orientation in most modern
316.24,3.48,programming languages
