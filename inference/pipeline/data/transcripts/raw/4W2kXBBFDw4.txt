1.6,3.32,"- [Narrator] What is human-centered
artificial intelligence?"
4.92,2.38,It's AI research inspired by the depth
7.3,2.21,"and diversity of human minds,"
9.51,1.23,concerned at each step
10.74,3.02,"with its ethical impact
on people and society,"
13.76,2.54,and intended to augment human capabilities
16.3,1.84,rather than replace them.
18.14,2.83,"This is the vision that
drive the Stanford Institute"
20.97,2.83,"for Human-Centered
Artificial Intelligence."
23.8,3.16,"It's a hub for education, policy,"
26.96,2.16,"and cross-disciplinary
research that merges"
29.12,2.87,"the study of AI with medicine, economics,"
31.99,3.803,"robotics, ethics, the
humanities, and much more."
36.72,2.253,Our work begins with the brain itself.
39.81,2.6,AI is intersecting with neuroscience
42.41,2.02,blending the study of machine intelligence
44.43,2.47,with the quest to understand our own.
46.9,1.31,- I work at the intersection
48.21,3.79,"of artificial intelligence
neuroscience and psychology,"
52.0,4.25,"working on using ideas from
artificial intelligence"
56.25,2.44,to make neural network models
58.69,3.31,"that allow us to understand
the brain and behavior,"
62.0,2.58,and conversely using insights
64.58,2.09,from neuroscience and cognitive science
66.67,2.09,to improve our ability
68.76,2.16,to solve artificial intelligence problems.
70.92,2.04,"You know, you see the world around you,"
72.96,2.78,"and by looking at the world and
you understand what's in it."
75.74,2.86,"You know, it may seem totally effortless"
78.6,2.49,"and almost like it's nothing
special is happening at all,"
81.09,4.97,"but actually almost half of
the cortical area of the brain"
86.06,1.89,is devoted to visual processing.
87.95,4.21,"That kind of underlying visual
technology is an incredibly"
92.16,1.81,important part of what the brain is doing.
93.97,1.78,And we're really interested in discovering
95.75,1.33,"what those algorithms are,"
97.08,1.93,"both so that we can
help machines understand"
99.01,0.833,the world better.
99.843,1.557,And also so that we can understand
101.4,2.11,the visual system of the brain.
103.51,2.07,"- [Narrator] Of course,
there's a big world outside"
105.58,3.69,"the brain and it's growing
more complex all the time."
109.27,2.53,"AI is intersecting with social science,"
111.8,3.64,"policy, and governance as
societies across the globe"
115.44,1.82,look for new ways to adapt.
117.26,2.31,"- Our lab is focused on a
number of collaborations"
119.57,3.2,"with government agencies,
including one with EPA,"
122.77,2.72,which has faced significant challenges
125.49,2.15,"in forcing the nation's
environmental laws."
127.64,3.26,"And what we are doing in
this project is to show"
130.9,3.52,the potential for AI to really help
134.42,2.32,"pinpoint enforcement resources,"
136.74,2.09,where there are particular hotspots
138.83,1.55,of environmental pollution.
140.38,2.55,It's critical that engineers understand
142.93,2.11,what 50 years of anti-discrimination law
145.04,1.64,has to say on the topic.
146.68,3.29,"And it's critical that our
law students understand"
149.97,2.69,"enough of the engineering
choices that are being made."
152.66,1.59,"And so, that is what's most exciting to me"
154.25,1.79,about high in terms of convening
156.04,3.01,"these kinds of conversations
to provide a path forward"
159.05,2.29,for the next generation of AI technology.
161.34,4.56,"It's important to remember
that AI has the potential"
165.9,3.17,"to dramatically reform
government for the better."
169.07,0.9,"On the other hand,"
169.97,5.0,"it's also possible for AI to
bake in problems of the past."
175.81,1.89,We have to be quite mindful to make sure
177.7,2.7,"that today are fair,
that we understand them,"
180.4,3.07,and that they work for the people
183.47,1.76,that are intended to serve.
185.23,3.31,"- [Narrator] But a fair
society must be resilient too."
188.54,3.17,"That's why AI is intersecting
with public health,"
191.71,2.78,"helping experts make sense of
the choices we make in light"
194.49,2.02,of the information we consume.
196.51,2.45,"- I'm an epidemiologist and
a public health physician,"
198.96,1.96,but I'm also a medical journalist.
200.92,2.08,I'm very interested in the intersection
203.0,2.02,"of not just contagious disease,"
205.02,1.71,but contagious misinformation
206.73,2.36,and disinformation about disease.
209.09,1.84,"So you're bringing to
the table, of course,"
210.93,2.86,"people with particular expertise in AI,"
213.79,2.0,"but you're also bringing
people with backgrounds"
215.79,3.25,"in psychology, social media, epidemiology,"
219.04,3.62,"medicine, nursing, and I
think that's what you need"
222.66,3.72,"in order to have human centered
AI that is truly effective,"
226.38,2.213,and is truly focused on the greater good.
229.69,3.08,"The future of AI hinges on people,"
232.77,2.94,trusting and engaging with AI.
235.71,3.5,"So the people that develop
AI systems need to be black,"
239.21,2.25,"need to be women, need to be nonbinary,"
241.46,2.24,"transgender, disabled, queer."
243.7,2.98,"They have to represent the
people in the real world"
246.68,2.34,who might engage with AI.
249.02,2.57,"- [Narrator] And while AI
helps to protect human life,"
251.59,2.623,it's also elevating our perception of it.
255.05,2.59,"AI is intersecting with the humanity,"
257.64,3.253,"changing the way artists of
all kinds express themselves."
262.23,2.78,"- Creative expression is
absolutely fundamental"
265.01,1.52,"to the human experience,"
266.53,2.55,"and you can't simply
have a human centered AI"
269.08,2.3,without that creativity.
271.38,2.26,"So I'm interested in when and where,"
273.64,3.71,"and if AI might just be
more than compatible,"
277.35,3.09,"but maybe actively
companionable might will extend"
280.44,2.11,and elevate creativity the way a pen
282.55,2.91,"or a paintbrush or a
musical instrument can."
285.46,2.36,"I also think is highly relevant for AI,"
287.82,2.09,the way arts expand traditional notions
289.91,2.16,of what a human subject is.
292.07,3.09,"The implicit default
having long been quite male"
295.16,2.82,"and middle-class,
able-bodied, neuro-typical,"
297.98,1.58,and that's sometimes taken for granted
299.56,2.553,in even innovative technological design.
303.2,1.46,"- [Narrator] At the heart
of each of these stories"
304.66,4.04,"is a question one will all
play a role in answering."
308.7,2.65,"As the intelligence of
this technology grows,"
311.35,2.853,"how do we want AI to intersect
with the way we live?"
315.73,2.95,"- I'm a professor of music
and computer science on paper,"
318.68,3.96,"but my lab explores ways
in which technology like AI"
322.64,2.28,can intersect with creative expression.
324.92,2.96,"I believe the quality of
the future that awaits us is"
327.88,4.05,"directly tied to the amount of
agency, freedom, and autonomy"
331.93,2.47,to force us as human beings.
334.4,3.04,"And that's why it's so
important for every researcher,"
337.44,2.66,"engineer, every investor, every user"
340.1,4.16,"working on or using artificial
intelligence to approach"
344.26,2.16,"their decisions by asking simple,"
346.42,2.39,but challenging question.
348.81,2.18,Is my work helping to preserve
350.99,2.96,and even extend human autonomy?
353.95,1.46,- [Narrator] This is what human centered
355.41,3.01,AI looks like at the Stanford Institute
358.42,2.25,"for Human Centered
Artificial Intelligence."
360.67,2.26,We're working hard to ensure it reflects
362.93,2.367,and serves everyone.
