0.16,3.44,what's going on everybody welcome back
1.76,3.44,to another video today we are gonna be
3.6,5.199,comparing python versus
5.2,3.599,r we're gonna see which one is better
9.17,3.14,[Music]
13.2,3.999,now before i start this presentation yes
15.36,2.8,i made an entire presentation for this
17.199,2.321,video
18.16,3.6,i have to address the elephant in the
19.52,3.28,room about a month ago i made a somewhat
21.76,2.4,controversial post
22.8,3.52,i don't think it's controversial some
24.16,3.52,people did apparently um and it's right
26.32,3.199,here hopefully on your screen at this
27.68,2.48,time all it says is python is better
29.519,3.2,than r
30.16,3.76,that's my opinion but it stirred up a
32.719,4.321,lot of emotions
33.92,7.28,for a lot of people a lot of people
37.04,6.72,messaged me commented on it and
41.2,3.76,apparently a lot of people took offense
43.76,3.92,to what i said
44.96,3.279,and they wanted me to explain why i felt
47.68,2.8,this way
48.239,3.681,and i did not respond for the pure fact
50.48,3.12,that it was more fun to watch them argue
51.92,2.56,and complain rather than answer their
53.6,2.4,question
54.48,3.599,but also i knew i was going to be making
56.0,3.68,this video anyways and so i just figured
58.079,3.601,they could watch this video whenever i
59.68,4.0,put it out which uh is right now
61.68,3.36,and so if you are only on linkedin and
63.68,2.56,you've never watched my channel before
65.04,2.079,and you are just seeing for this for the
66.24,3.52,first time
67.119,3.121,and you remember that time when i posted
69.76,2.8,it
70.24,3.44,i hope this will be clarifying for you
72.56,3.52,um and so
73.68,4.079,without further ado let's get into the
76.08,4.48,presentation
77.759,4.0,uh and we will start from there all
80.56,2.8,right so some of the things that we're
81.759,2.641,going to be discussing today in our
83.36,3.439,python versus
84.4,3.84,our presentation is we're going to talk
86.799,5.041,about descriptions
88.24,6.0,different libraries the code syntax
91.84,3.68,pros and cons of both and my final
94.24,3.839,answer
95.52,4.639,uh i will say before we get into it i'm
98.079,5.121,not trying to go super in depth
100.159,5.92,uh i i tried to make it as user-friendly
103.2,4.879,as possible if you know you guys are
106.079,4.241,really wanting a more in-depth
108.079,4.08,presentation on just one of these i can
110.32,2.799,absolutely do that i plan on doing that
112.159,2.24,at some point
113.119,3.921,but this is going to be kind of high
114.399,4.4,level and more talking about my thoughts
117.04,4.079,and my feelings regarding this because
118.799,3.841,it is a very emotional thing i believe
121.119,3.201,without further ado let's get into the
122.64,4.32,description of both again
124.32,4.32,keeping it more high level and kind of
126.96,4.48,getting to some specifics
128.64,5.36,and then my conclusion so let's look at
131.44,4.32,the description of both python and r
134.0,3.599,starting with r r is a programming
135.76,2.64,language developed for statistical
137.599,2.881,analysis
138.4,4.08,and the people who mostly used it for a
140.48,4.0,long long time where statisticians and
142.48,4.72,just recently within the past you know
144.48,4.56,five ten years has really been used for
147.2,3.84,data science and data analysis and
149.04,4.72,visualizations and all of those things
151.04,4.559,it was developed in 1993 again like i
153.76,4.16,just said primarily for statisticians
155.599,5.041,data miners and analysts
157.92,4.88,and it's used by a ton of very large
160.64,5.2,companies some of them are uber
162.8,4.88,facebook and google but there are tons
165.84,3.039,of companies and even small companies
167.68,2.88,that use r and so
168.879,3.601,if your company does any type of
170.56,3.36,statistics or statistical analysis
172.48,3.039,there's a good chance that
173.92,3.36,your company has either used r in the
175.519,3.121,past or is currently using r as a
177.28,3.44,programming language
178.64,3.84,now onto python python is a general
180.72,2.08,purpose programming language it's used
182.48,2.479,for
182.8,3.519,almost anything you can imagine it may
184.959,3.841,not be the best thing
186.319,3.041,for every single thing it can do but it
188.8,2.96,can do
189.36,3.599,almost anything and so it's very general
191.76,2.96,very broad
192.959,3.601,it is quickly becoming the most popular
194.72,3.36,programming language in the world
196.56,3.28,and it is used by companies like google
198.08,3.68,facebook and netflix now
199.84,3.039,if you notice in the companies that use
201.76,2.96,python and are
202.879,3.36,both facebook and google are on that
204.72,2.56,list then that wasn't by accident i did
206.239,2.881,that on purpose
207.28,3.76,because i wanted to show that these
209.12,2.24,companies large companies are going to
211.04,2.08,use
211.36,3.12,both programming languages for what
213.12,3.119,they're good for
214.48,3.36,which obviously we will talk about later
216.239,3.681,but i wanted to just kind of
217.84,3.2,put that there for um i guess
219.92,2.959,foreshadowing
221.04,3.6,now before we look at libraries and
222.879,3.92,packages i just want to say
224.64,4.239,that if i did not highlight your
226.799,4.561,favorite library or package on here
228.879,3.041,i am sorry there are so many especially
231.36,3.12,with r
231.92,4.319,there's just hundreds and thousands of
234.48,4.56,different packages and libraries
236.239,4.801,uh i just can't possibly put them all on
239.04,4.24,here and so these are just a
241.04,3.68,highlight of some of the more popular
243.28,2.239,ones the ones that i have personally
244.72,2.96,used
245.519,4.161,and so i hope that you are not offended
247.68,3.6,by that but let's start with r
249.68,4.32,for data collection you can use things
251.28,6.239,like our crawler read excel
254.0,5.68,read rl and r curl for data wrangling
257.519,4.56,exploration there's dplyr sql df
259.68,4.0,data.table read r and tidyr
262.079,4.481,and for data visualization there's
263.68,5.519,ggplot2 ggviz plotly squis
266.56,4.639,and shiny and over to python for a data
269.199,2.961,collection there's pandas requests and
271.199,2.401,beautiful soup
272.16,3.599,for data wrangling and exploration
273.6,3.44,there's pandas numpy and scipy and for
275.759,4.88,data visualization
277.04,5.52,there is matplotlib seaborn and plotly
280.639,3.761,again this is just a high level overview
282.56,3.199,of some of the packages in each of these
284.4,3.44,programming languages
285.759,3.681,if you have never used r or python i
287.84,3.359,think these packages are a really good
289.44,4.0,place to start
291.199,4.081,now for the code and the syntax on both
293.44,2.8,of these i tried to stay neutral on this
295.28,2.16,i tried to just
296.24,2.8,kind of say what everyone else was
297.44,3.36,saying because i have my own very strong
299.04,3.599,thoughts and opinions on this
300.8,3.52,uh but you know i wanted to stay
302.639,4.881,somewhat unbiased
304.32,6.319,at least for this one um but for r
307.52,4.8,it's easy medium difficulty to pick up
310.639,3.521,and start working from
312.32,3.52,from scratch you know if you've never
314.16,4.879,picked up r it can be
315.84,4.24,kind of difficult to pick up um a little
319.039,2.961,bit more advanced
320.08,4.559,it can be difficult to maintain your
322.0,5.28,code especially as you start to scale
324.639,4.4,your code and so that is a big problem
327.28,2.639,that a lot of people have addressed or
329.039,4.081,talked about with
329.919,5.521,r with python again it's easy medium
333.12,4.72,difficulty to pick up and learn
335.44,3.36,i i think it can be about the same
337.84,4.32,difficulty as
338.8,4.16,r in my opinion and that's what a lot of
342.16,2.479,people said
342.96,3.679,and so that's not just my opinion but
344.639,5.28,it's easier to write and maintain
346.639,5.521,larger scale code and so as you
349.919,3.84,start building larger projects or join
352.16,1.92,larger teams or take on more data it's
353.759,3.121,just
354.08,4.959,easier to scale up now into some syntax
356.88,3.52,examples i 100 cherry pick these
359.039,3.121,but i do feel like they're pretty
360.4,4.639,representative of
362.16,3.44,what the code looks like as a whole and
365.039,1.761,so
365.6,3.12,a lot of people are probably gonna get
366.8,3.44,mad at me saying no r is
368.72,3.68,much easier than this and you may be
370.24,3.6,right in some aspects but
372.4,3.359,for the most part i feel like this is
373.84,3.6,fairly accurate we're just reading in a
375.759,2.401,csv file and then trying to find the
377.44,2.96,mean on
378.16,3.2,a column or a field and that's about it
380.4,3.76,and as you can tell
381.36,4.08,r is just a little bit more difficult a
384.16,2.72,little bit more complicated
385.44,3.84,python's a little bit more cleaner it's
386.88,4.24,a little bit more easy to read
389.28,3.84,and pick up and that's something that a
391.12,3.44,lot of people say about python it's very
393.12,2.72,easily readable
394.56,2.639,now let's look at some of the pros and
395.84,2.4,cons of both we're going to be starting
397.199,2.961,with r
398.24,3.84,some of the pros are that it is open
400.16,4.479,source it is fantastic for
402.08,4.559,statistical analysis has hundreds of
404.639,3.12,packages and libraries purely for
406.639,4.0,analytics
407.759,3.761,and that's what r is it's purely for
410.639,3.361,statistics
411.52,5.28,and analyzing data and lastly it is easy
414.0,5.12,to build visualizations with r
416.8,3.519,now for the cons it can't be embedded in
419.12,3.04,web applications and
420.319,3.28,from what i've read that's purely for
422.16,4.479,security reasons
423.599,4.481,and so that is a big downside of using r
426.639,3.601,you need to know a large amount of
428.08,4.239,packages and libraries you can't just
430.24,3.76,know like one or two
432.319,3.361,kind of like in python you can know
434.0,2.96,pandas and you can do a lot of different
435.68,4.0,things with it
436.96,3.76,r doesn't really have that you have to
439.68,2.959,know
440.72,3.759,several things in order to get kind of
442.639,3.84,one task done
444.479,3.201,and lastly r can run slow because of how
446.479,2.961,they store their data
447.68,4.4,so those are some of the pros and the
449.44,5.12,cons of r now let's move on to python
452.08,3.2,some of the pros for python it's open
454.56,3.44,source
455.28,3.759,it's easy to read and learn especially
458.0,2.4,if you're just picking it up for the
459.039,4.0,first time
460.4,4.4,it can be embedded into web applications
463.039,3.041,which can be very important for a lot of
464.8,2.799,people
466.08,3.6,and there's a growing number of
467.599,4.32,libraries for data analysis there
469.68,5.12,are of course growing number of of
471.919,5.601,libraries and packages for r as well but
474.8,3.2,those are quite more well established
477.52,2.16,while
478.0,3.599,python is still growing and they're
479.68,4.4,coming out and they're catching up to r
481.599,3.761,fairly quickly for the cons the
484.08,3.519,processing speed
485.36,4.559,can be slow especially depending on what
487.599,3.841,library or package you're using
489.919,3.441,but you know i think that's a con in
491.44,4.479,both r and python
493.36,4.559,on some level they're going to run slow
495.919,3.84,it uses a large amount of memory
497.919,4.081,kind of part of the why it's running
499.759,4.801,slow it's simple
502.0,3.759,to learn um and simple to use and
504.56,4.24,sometimes that's
505.759,5.201,an issue actually because it's so simple
508.8,3.44,when you need to do really complicated
510.96,3.999,things it can
512.24,4.239,be kind of hard to do where an r that's
514.959,2.481,what it's built for it's made for those
516.479,3.281,complex
517.44,4.159,calculations and so that's why those
519.76,2.719,packages and libraries are built the way
521.599,2.8,they are
522.479,3.121,and lastly the libraries for all
524.399,3.601,analytics needs are
525.6,3.12,still being developed and so yes it is a
528.0,2.8,pro that
528.72,3.2,those numbers are growing uh but it's
530.8,4.88,still a con that they're
531.92,5.359,you know behind our and so r has more
535.68,3.12,being developed and more already
537.279,3.12,developed in terms of
538.8,4.719,all their libraries and packages being
540.399,5.041,built out or python it is still growing
543.519,3.681,now on to my final answer which is
545.44,4.48,better python or r
547.2,4.079,it really depends um but going back to
549.92,2.72,my linkedin post that we talked about
551.279,4.721,the very beginning
552.64,5.84,i will say that i still 100 believe that
556.0,3.44,because to me for my type of work the
558.48,3.28,stuff that i do
559.44,3.6,python is 100 times better it's 100
561.76,4.48,times more useful
563.04,5.6,and so to me python is better than r but
566.24,3.36,it really does depend on what you're
568.64,2.56,using it for
569.6,3.52,and so if you're doing purely
571.2,3.04,statistical work r is going to be the
573.12,2.88,better choice
574.24,3.92,if you're doing machine learning python
576.0,5.2,is arguably much better
578.16,4.64,in my opinion r is harder to learn but
581.2,4.48,it has more features
582.8,4.719,while python is easier to learn but
585.68,3.36,isn't as developed yet
587.519,3.44,and so what i genuinely think you should
589.04,3.04,do is i think you should try both i
590.959,1.761,think you really need to get some
592.08,2.879,hands-on
592.72,3.2,experience take a course in both just
594.959,2.641,see what you think
595.92,3.359,and and determine for yourself what you
597.6,3.6,think is better i
599.279,3.761,really will go back to that linkedin for
601.2,3.68,a second i believe that for me
603.04,3.52,personally python is just better i can
604.88,5.199,use it for so many things it
606.56,6.399,is in my opinion much better suited
610.079,3.44,for me and what i do for my job and so
612.959,3.281,for me
613.519,5.041,python is way better but for other
616.24,4.32,positions and other people are maybe
618.56,3.6,the programming language of choice and
620.56,2.959,i'm totally okay with that
622.16,3.44,there were a lot of people in the
623.519,4.161,comments who were writing
625.6,3.76,you know it just depends and and you
627.68,3.04,know why don't you think that
629.36,3.12,one why do you think that one is better
630.72,2.559,than the other you know why can't it be
632.48,2.4,both
633.279,3.841,and i really wanted to respond and be
634.88,4.8,like i agree with you uh but i didn't
637.12,4.0,because again i thought it was more fun
639.68,2.0,and i knew i was making this video and
641.12,3.12,so
641.68,4.32,i i genuinely in the bottom of my heart
644.24,3.52,to all those people i agree with you
646.0,4.32,and so i want you to feel some
647.76,5.199,vindication some sense of
650.32,3.759,you know you you you were right and so i
652.959,4.081,hope that
654.079,4.641,this was um hopefully a good outcome for
657.04,4.479,what you're hoping for
658.72,3.28,uh i have nothing against r i have used
661.519,3.041,it
662.0,3.279,um and i and i've taken a few courses on
664.56,2.16,it um
665.279,3.601,i have not used that much art in my
666.72,3.6,actual job although the data scientists
