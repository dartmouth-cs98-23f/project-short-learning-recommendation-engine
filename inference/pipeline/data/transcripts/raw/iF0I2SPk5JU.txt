0.29,4.029,"Most Software Engineers have a degree in Engineering
or Science. Do you know why? There are 2 main"
4.319,5.771,"reasons for this. One, Engineers can generally
think logically. Two, Engineers are good at"
10.09,3.37,"Math. One of the major reasons I was able
to get a job at Google without a Computer"
13.46,3.8,"Science degree is because I am above average
at Math. Now, I can not teach you all the"
17.26,4.24,"Math I know in a short video. You anyway don’t
need most of it to become a Programmer. Let"
21.5,4.72,"me do this. I’ll share 5 essential Math
Skills that will get you 80% there. The rest"
26.22,3.67,"of 20%, you can learn on the go as you encounter
new problems."
29.89,4.349,"But why do programmers even need Math? Imagine that
you are a Software Engineer at Google. And"
34.239,3.771,"you are given a critical problem to solve.
Many Google users are not able to access the"
38.01,4.05,"website because of an overloaded server. This
problem is getting worse with every passing"
42.06,4.05,"minute because the client side is configured
to do an automatic retry after one second"
46.11,6.09,"for every failed call. You talk to a Senior
engineer on your team and she recommends using"
52.2,3.499,"“Exponential Backoff” for retries. What
does “exponential” mean, you ask her."
55.699,3.721,"She points you to the documentation. If your
basic math skills are not good, it might take"
59.42,3.849,"you a long time to understand and implement
the “exponential” piece of the algorithm"
63.269,4.071,"even after reading the documentation. And
in the meantime, the entire internet traffic"
67.34,3.849,"will see a huge drop because for many people,
No google means no internet."
71.189,3.901,"Now if that example doesn’t convince you,
here's an even more important reason to learn"
75.09,3.84,"Math. Most tech companies conduct coding interviews
to see if you are a good fit for the role."
78.93,4.579,"And whether you like it or not, they ask algorithmic
style questions in these interviews. At the"
83.509,3.75,"end of the interview, the interviewer usually
asks you the time and space complexity of"
87.259,3.68,"your solution. In order to answer these questions
and actually get the job, you need to know"
90.939,4.691,"some basic Math concepts. Many people who
come from non-CS and non-Engineering backgrounds"
95.63,4.31,"have a hard time answering these questions.
So, I have chosen the top 5 Math Skills for"
99.94,1.73,today keeping these interviews in mind.
101.67,3.729,"Now, I know that there’s a sizable number
of you who pretty much hate coding interviews"
105.399,3.501,"and don’t want to go through them. And I
completely respect your position. But for"
108.9,4.109,"the vast majority of us, we don’t have the
luxury to give up on our dreams just because"
113.009,5.481,"we don't like one step of the process. This video
is for those people. Let’s learn some Math."
118.49,4.23,"To learn the first concept, we need to start
with an exercise. Here a piece of code that"
122.72,4.329,"contains a for loop nested inside another
for loop. What is the time complexity of this"
127.049,3.74,"code? In other words, how many times would
this code print “Hello, World!” for any"
130.789,6.051,"arbitrary value of N. This video is going to be interactive. So, you can pause this video and leave the answer in the comments."
136.84,4.78,"If your answer is O(N^2) or N^2 times, then
you would benefit a lot from what I am about"
141.62,4.18,"to tell you. Most people who answer N^2 do
it because they confuse the code I gave you"
145.8,4.299,"with this other piece of code. They see a
nested for loop inside another and immediately"
150.099,3.711,"jump to the N^2 which is the wrong answer
in this case. To understand why that is, let’s"
153.81,3.77,"think from the first principles. Looking at
the code, it’s obvious that the outside"
157.58,4.79,"for loop runs N times. Each time this outside
loop runs, we go inside and run this nested"
162.37,3.85,"loop K times. We don’t know what that K
is at this time but we will find that out"
166.22,1.0,"shortly. So we print a total of K “Hello,
World!” statements everytime we go inside"
167.22,1.75,"the outer “for loop” which itself happens
N times. So, in total we print K*N “Hello,"
168.97,4.86,"World!” statements. Now, if you look at this other easier and more popular piece of code, the internal loop"
173.83,2.54,"also runs N times. So, K*N in this case is
equal to N^2. But, that’s not the case in"
176.37,3.58,"the code I gave you. What I want you to take
away from this is that whenever you have A"
179.95,6.0,"that happens x times. And whenever A happens,
B happens y times. B will happen a total of"
185.95,1.0,x*y times.
186.95,4.32,"Now, to know the value of K in the last exercise,
we need to know the second concept. So,"
191.27,4.29,"here is a question for you. You are given
a stick that is 32 meters in length. You break it"
195.56,4.63,"into 2 halves. You throw the right piece away
and break the left piece into 2 halves again."
200.19,4.28,"You throw away the right half and keep breaking
the left piece until you have a stick of length"
204.47,4.07,"1m left. How many times did you break the
stick in total? You can pause the video and"
208.54,4.05,"leave the answer down below. If you answered
5, then you are right. Here’s an interesting"
212.59,4.28,"observation about the answer. If you take
2 which is the number of pieces you break"
216.87,5.11,"stick into every time and you take 5 which
is your answer. And you multiply 2 to itself"
221.98,4.78,"5 times, you get 32 which is the original
length of the stick. In other words, 2 to"
226.76,4.8,"the power of 5 is 32. Whenever you have an
equation like this, 5 is called logarithm"
231.56,5.42,"of 32. Technically, it’s logarithm to the
base 2 but in computer science, people usually"
236.98,4.369,"think in terms of logarithm to the base 2.
So, we can just call it logarithm or log here"
241.349,4.401,"for our purpose. But it’s important to know
that in Math, people usually mean logarithm"
245.75,4.599,"to base 10 when they say log. I recommend
you to read a little bit more about logarithm"
250.349,5.381,"on your own. Anyway, in the generic case,
if 2 to the power x is N. Then, x is called"
255.73,5.917,"the logarithm of N. So in the stick example, you broke the stick a total of log32 times, which is 5."
261.647,3.033,"Going back to the example with 2 for loops, if you look closely"
264.68,4.42,"at the internal for loop, it does exactly
the opposite of the stick breaking example."
269.1,6.16,"You start with a stick of length 1. When you
do j = j*2 or in other words double the length,"
275.26,3.65,"you are bringing a stick of the same length
from somewhere and you are attaching it to the original"
278.91,4.099,"stick. And you keep doing it until you reach
the length N. So, how many times do you have"
283.009,6.621,"to double the length of the stick this way until you reach the length of N. Looking at stick example I gave you, It’s going to be log(N)"
289.63,3.67,"and that’s the K we were looking for. So,
the total number of times you print “Hello,"
293.3,5.429,"World!” in this case is N*K, which is Nlog(N). If you
have some experience with algorithms, I’m"
298.729,2.94,sure you already seen that the stick breaking example is very similar
301.669,4.84,"to Binary Search algorithm.
Logarithm also appears in some other algorithms like Sorting"
306.509,1.72,and some Heap related problems.
308.229,4.511,"Before I can explain what exponential means
in “exponential backoff”, we have to understand"
312.74,4.209,"the third concept of the day. For that,
I have another question for you. How many"
316.949,5.231,"3 digit numbers can you make by using digits
1,2 and 3 given that you can use each digit"
322.18,4.25,"only once? You can pause the video and leave
the answer in the comments. If you answered"
326.43,5.15,"6, then you are right. But what if I asked
the same question for 9 digit numbers using"
331.58,5.63,"digits 1 to 9 without repetition? To answer
this question, you would need to know what"
337.21,4.709,"a Factorial is. Let’s see what factorial
is using the 3 digit problem. We will call"
341.919,5.09,"first digit A, second one B and the third
one C. Let’s pick the first digit of this"
347.009,5.201,"number. For that we can use any digit from
1, 2 and 3. So, we have 3 options here. Let’s"
352.21,5.019,"say we pick 2 here. For the second digit,
we have only 2 options left because we can"
357.229,5.341,"use one digit only once. Let’s say we pick
3 for the second digit. Now, for the last digit, we have only"
362.57,5.46,"one option left which is 1. So, A can have 3 values. For each A, B can have 2 values."
368.03,4.9,"And for each B, C can have 1 value. Can you
see that we can use the first concept that"
372.93,4.77,"we learnt today here? So, the total 3 digit
numbers would be a multiplication of 3, 2"
377.7,6.16,"and 1 which is 6. For a 9 digit number using
digits 1 to 9, the answer would be the multiplication"
383.86,5.11,"of all the numbers from 1 to 9. And this multiplication
is called 9 factorial and is written like this."
388.97,4.699,"Factorial is nothing but a multiplication
of all numbers from 1 to that number including"
393.669,4.571,"the number itself. Factorial appears in many
algorithms like finding subsets of a set and"
398.24,1.72,permutations of numbers etc.
399.96,5.13,"Now that we have that out of the way, let’s
talk about the fourth concept which is “Exponentials”."
405.09,4.329,"For that, we need to go back to the 3 digit
numbers example. Let me change the question"
409.419,4.991,"a little bit for you. How many 3 digit numbers
can you make using 1, 2 and 3 if you can"
414.41,3.64,"use a digit more than once? I would love
to see your answer in the comments. If we"
418.05,4.69,"go back to the example I gave for the
factorials, you will see that now we have 3"
422.74,4.82,"options for A, B and C. And that’s why total
such 3 digit numbers now would be 3 into 3"
427.56,6.18,"into 3 which is 3 to the power 3. And this
is called exponentiation or exponential. Let’s try to understand"
433.74,2.93,"exponential backoff based on what we know
now. In the “exponential backoff” algorithm,"
436.67,3.53,"you will
do the first retry for the failed request"
440.2,5.17,"after x seconds. If the request fails again,
you increase the wait time for retry by let’s"
445.37,5.37,"say, 2 times. If it fails again, you increase
the wait time 2 times again. And you keep"
450.74,4.399,"doing it. If you look closely, the wait time
for retrying the failed request is increasing"
455.139,4.461,"exponentially here. Hence, the name “exponential
backoff”. One of the main characteristics"
459.6,4.98,"of something that is exponential is that it
increases or decreases really fast. For example,"
464.58,4.36,"the spread of Covid was exponential because
one person can infect let’s say 3 people,"
468.94,5.74,"each of those 3 infect 3 more and so on. Exponential
growth is a powerful concept for life in general"
474.68,4.35,"and it can be life changing for new programmers.
That’s because in the beginning, most programmers"
479.03,4.11,"have this nagging feeling that they are not
growing fast enough. Many get demotivated"
483.14,3.059,"and give up as a result.
But, here’s a graph showing the power of"
486.199,4.581,"exponentiation from the book Atomic Habits
by James Clear. If you just improve 1 percent"
490.78,4.97,"each day for 365 days, you will be 38 times
better at the end of the year. And if you"
495.75,5.71,"build bad habits and become just 1% worse
each day, you will lose 97% of what you have"
501.46,3.86,"today in one year. That’s exponentiation
in action for you, my friend."
505.32,4.49,"Another concept you need to know about is
Modulus. For positive numbers, modulus or"
509.81,4.659,"mode is the same as what you would normally
call remainder in division of 2 numbers. Modulus"
514.469,5.401,"operator is written as a percentage sign.
So, 27 mod 5 is 2 which is the same as the"
519.87,4.73,"remainder when you divide 27 by 5. For negative
numbers, there’s a small difference between"
524.6,4.51,"mod and remainder which I recommend you read
up yourself. Some popular interview problems"
529.11,5.18,"that use mod are “Find greatest common divisor
of 2 numbers” and “Fizzbuzz”."
534.29,3.98,"So now you know the Math you need to become
a programmer. Next, you need a simple well"
538.27,4.499,"defined step by step path to learn programming.
If you want to know the path that I recommend,"
542.769,4.281,"watch this video. My name is Sahil and I will
see you in the next one."
