second,duration,transcript
0.0,4.08,title of this talk is yet again about
2.8,3.2,data science
4.08,4.24,with game theory i'll call it data
6.0,5.519,science with game three flavor
8.32,4.08,and i've been involved with research
11.519,2.401,related this
12.4,3.84,signature with computer science and game
13.92,4.64,tv for many years by now
16.24,4.0,and this particular initiative started
18.56,3.84,already six seven years ago when i
20.24,5.039,returned from my previous period in
22.4,6.16,industry long time with industry
25.279,7.12,where basically uh my feeling was
28.56,5.2,that classical data science algorithms i
32.399,3.68,call it data science
33.76,4.0,because i refer to the real practical
36.079,6.0,things that are used in
37.76,7.04,ir applied ml and some things in llp
42.079,4.401,and recommendation systems actually need
44.8,4.32,to be revisited
46.48,4.32,so i talked about a very bottom-up
49.12,3.759,approach really taking a very
50.8,3.68,very basic algorithms and search
52.879,3.281,accommodation prediction
54.48,3.28,and more and the claim is that need to
56.16,3.919,be revolutionized
57.76,5.119,and i try to illustrate it in a very
60.079,5.201,brief talking with one or two examples
62.879,4.24,and i just like to say that in general
65.28,4.56,if i had to have a much longer talk i
67.119,5.121,need to talk about two perspectives
69.84,3.84,at least one of them is what we call the
72.24,3.68,agent perspective
73.68,3.2,but we talk about predictions
75.92,2.879,fragmentation
76.88,3.36,persuasion but in competitive
78.799,3.761,environments
80.24,4.16,and the other one is what i like to call
82.56,3.44,the mediator perspective mediators i
84.4,3.28,think that the work for many years by
86.0,4.56,now but when you talk about media it
87.68,5.68,does the mediator is
90.56,3.919,google is facebook it's amazon or
93.36,3.84,whatever where
94.479,3.6,many publishers whatever comments there
97.2,2.959,are
98.079,3.201,have their own incentives and you need
100.159,3.121,to mediate it
101.28,3.68,while we're one way or another and in
103.28,5.04,both of them the claim is
104.96,5.439,this particular notion of incentives
108.32,4.56,needs to be really integrated in a very
110.399,4.481,basic algorithms and
112.88,4.16,i'll be happy when we actually replace
114.88,4.96,the current algorithms
117.04,4.079,so a word about the agent story i'll try
119.84,4.239,to read very brief
121.119,3.841,and i know how much i managed to do but
124.079,2.881,i'll try
124.96,3.04,so the agent story is the following one
126.96,4.079,here is a nice lady
128.0,3.76,her name is gal and girls need to choose
131.039,4.721,among two
131.76,6.08,uh two applications that are very
135.76,5.52,popular these days of guessing
137.84,5.84,uh guessing your age and
141.28,5.28,one application guesses that her age is
143.68,4.48,24 and one said that her age is 34
146.56,4.0,and as you know god is a very confident
148.16,4.12,woman and therefore probably she'll
150.56,4.56,choose
152.28,4.679,34 because her age is 36 so
155.12,3.759,it's you know this one wins and from
156.959,2.721,this point on she actually will use this
158.879,4.08,application
159.68,5.6,that's that's the reality uh
162.959,3.121,so this refers to indulgence that i've
165.28,2.56,been involved with
166.08,3.76,people in theoretical computer science
167.84,3.759,already 10 years ago that we call
169.84,3.36,dueling algorithms we don't
171.599,3.36,need to go over all of this slide
173.2,3.44,especially who says the classical
174.959,5.121,algorithms basically
176.64,5.92,try to minimize some some error
180.08,4.64,average error or some expectation while
182.56,4.24,in stochastic process and in reality
184.72,3.92,many cases you care about
186.8,3.12,the probability of being better than the
188.64,3.12,other so
189.92,4.319,think about will be more specific you
191.76,3.04,have many users user come to you and you
194.239,4.561,know
194.8,5.12,if you if bob with the new algorithm
198.8,4.24,which compete with the
199.92,4.48,classical written alice will be better
203.04,3.759,predictor for you
204.4,3.199,than you probably tell your friends and
206.799,2.8,basically
207.599,3.92,you basically try to compete and be
209.599,5.041,better than alice
211.519,4.8,on most of the instances anyway don't
214.64,3.599,like to take a position here but there
216.319,2.721,is some trade of bitcoin optimism
218.239,2.961,optimizing
219.04,3.839,instances to optimize incomes so that's
221.2,4.0,very theory kind of thing
222.879,5.041,but it really connects very very
225.2,4.8,directly to data science kind of thing
227.92,4.56,because we have a very similar situation
230.0,4.159,in our data science applications
232.48,3.36,we just don't have access to the
234.159,3.761,distribution
235.84,4.319,for example in regression task we may
237.92,3.84,have access only to sample of points
240.159,3.28,uh instances labels and the
241.76,2.88,corresponding opponent predictions and
243.439,3.041,be more specific
244.64,3.679,so i'll give an example from the early
246.48,5.119,parts of this work with
248.319,5.441,my student um so that's that's a very
251.599,5.2,early work on that subject that we did
253.76,4.479,so think about a realistic system this
256.799,4.081,is the boston
258.239,3.601,boston apartment kind of database that
260.88,3.28,you need to
261.84,4.16,basically predict the apartment value
264.16,2.56,based on certain parameters here we just
266.0,2.16,assume
266.72,3.759,let's assume that it depends only on the
268.16,3.92,top and sides and alice is the standard
270.479,3.44,algorithm that use some
272.08,3.28,let's say just some linear regression
273.919,3.601,for a minute and don't
275.36,3.36,need to respond to it to apply a best
277.52,3.04,response to it
278.72,4.08,so the key issue here is that when you
280.56,3.199,respond there were some points that
282.8,2.959,you'll be better
283.759,3.521,closer to bob and some that you are
285.759,3.521,closer to alice
287.28,3.359,and basically when you respond you like
289.28,4.24,to design you have
290.639,3.921,access to some points that you see what
293.52,4.16,was the reality
294.56,3.68,how alice behaves you can try it and
297.68,2.56,then for
298.24,4.32,new users most of the users didn't show
300.24,3.6,yet you'd like to be a better predictor
302.56,4.0,for something that will come in the
303.84,3.6,future so let's formalize it a little
306.56,3.44,bit
307.44,3.199,so the model is is starting it's
310.0,3.36,entering
310.639,3.681,to classical park learning model it
313.36,4.08,enters already
314.32,5.599,some notions that come from games but as
317.44,4.64,you see these are very practical ones
319.919,3.601,there are instance domain some subset of
322.08,4.559,our foreign
323.52,5.119,a label domain some y and alice is using
326.639,4.321,a strategy h bar
328.639,3.761,which is some hypothesis in fact unknown
330.96,4.72,to bob
332.4,6.32,and there is a joint distribution
335.68,5.76,over the following triplet the instances
338.72,4.4,the labels and the disparity of alice
341.44,4.72,how much alice was wrong
343.12,5.359,on this kind of things or is wrong with
346.16,3.759,her algorithm this distribution is
348.479,4.0,unknown
349.919,4.401,but bob can access this actually happens
352.479,5.601,in the real applications
354.32,4.56,there is access to a sequence of
358.08,2.8,examples
358.88,4.4,that come from this distribution this is
360.88,4.879,all all that he has
363.28,4.08,so belt's payoff if he chooses a
365.759,4.72,hypothesis of strategy age
367.36,5.92,against his age bar is just
370.479,5.361,the probability that its disparity or
373.28,6.72,his disparity or his operative disparity
375.84,6.4,will be lower than alice the spirit
380.0,4.4,so you can define now the classical
382.24,6.0,empirical payoffs given a sequence
384.4,4.639,s of or sample bomb empirical payoff is
388.24,3.679,just
389.039,4.641,the sum of points that is better on it
391.919,2.081,or the average number of points that is
393.68,3.76,better
394.0,5.84,than alice on this sample set and
397.44,3.68,we'll call a star an empirical best
399.84,3.199,response or ebr
401.12,3.76,if we just this is that what is your
403.039,5.041,strategy that maximize
404.88,4.879,this payoff now we can ask the classical
408.08,4.72,question should boy employ
409.759,4.961,bob employ empirical best response and
412.8,3.519,we have the classical problem maximizing
414.72,3.919,the empirical payoff might result in
416.319,4.16,overfitting and the solutions
418.639,3.441,restrict the statutory space and so on
420.479,4.72,and so forth
422.08,4.8,but what we'd like to emphasize in this
425.199,4.241,first part of the talk we'll get to
426.88,4.719,gathering somewhat later
429.44,3.84,is that already we have a problem here
431.599,4.961,of best response
433.28,4.72,given a strategy set age which may say
436.56,3.6,we say that some
438.0,3.12,small agent h is an absolute best
440.16,4.159,response
441.12,4.0,if for every h prime in age it holds
444.319,4.081,that
445.12,6.16,what you actually get in your or
448.4,3.919,your payoff is absolutely close to what
451.28,4.4,you're obtaining
452.319,6.16,in this h prime so you are epsilon
455.68,4.56,optimal and the objective is given this
458.479,3.521,general hypothesis space
460.24,3.76,level approximates best response
462.0,4.08,efficiently with high probability
464.0,3.84,that's the first step that you need to
466.08,4.16,solve in order to get
467.84,4.16,to to be frank in real application even
470.24,2.239,in communications it's also the last
472.0,3.039,step
472.479,4.081,but we'll talk about the multi-agent
475.039,3.121,setting as well
476.56,3.759,and in this particular problem the
478.16,3.84,results were characterization of the
480.319,4.0,back level strategy sets
482.0,4.16,via the notion of visiting mention full
484.319,3.681,analysis for linear predictors
486.16,3.52,and experimental results showing that
488.0,4.319,you actually can
489.68,3.84,defeat a algorithm classical algorithms
492.319,4.401,and realistic setting
493.52,4.799,using this approach when i said best
496.72,2.479,linear response i'd like to give you an
498.319,2.72,example of
499.199,3.761,things that we did i talked just on
501.039,4.481,linear systems in order to be
502.96,3.12,to illustrate these things but even this
505.52,3.44,setting
506.08,4.959,is not that naive because our lists can
508.96,4.319,be a complex netherlands
511.039,3.761,all that we need is an access to an
513.279,4.64,example of the points
514.8,4.799,of her predictions we don't need to say
517.919,3.6,that it's a linear predictor although if
519.599,2.401,we know what is the power of alice we
521.519,2.4,can do
522.0,3.44,something else that i'll mention in a
523.919,5.281,minute
525.44,6.0,so so what will be a theorem here
529.2,3.68,so that's one of our theorem given
531.44,4.72,epsilon delta
532.88,4.88,we run the ebr algorithm the builder
536.16,4.88,messaging algorithm on
537.76,4.16,that number of points m points sample
541.04,4.4,points
541.92,6.32,were sample i idea from this
545.44,3.519,d for this distribution on the triplets
548.24,3.039,and after
548.959,4.56,time that is polynomial and m m is the
551.279,5.441,number of points in the sample
553.519,4.32,it outputs its star such that
556.72,3.2,probability at least
557.839,3.281,minus delta we have something which is
559.92,4.8,absolute best response
561.12,6.88,what we mean is that for reasonable
564.72,3.679,systems we can actually have this kind
568.0,3.12,of
568.399,3.521,of result and later we need
571.12,3.76,approximation
571.92,4.32,stuff like that so just to illustrate
574.88,4.639,you what is going on here
576.24,4.719,just it's not a technical talk really
579.519,2.961,about but i'd like to illustrate what is
580.959,5.121,going on here
582.48,5.52,think about alice as a very simple uh
586.08,3.52,regression kind of algorithm we're just
588.0,5.36,using a bar x
589.6,7.52,plus b bar to the to to predict y
593.36,7.36,and there are three points so ali's line
597.12,6.48,here is appears here on the screen
600.72,4.08,and it's a point in the parameter space
603.6,4.72,a b
604.8,4.479,a bar b bar now what happens for each
608.32,3.6,point
609.279,3.841,there are two parallel hyperplanes that
611.92,5.039,in between them
613.12,6.8,you are better predictor than
616.959,4.241,then alice if you if you like to compute
619.92,3.52,the best response
621.2,4.24,and this this goes for any pair of
623.44,3.04,points but what we get here is what is
625.44,4.88,called a
626.48,5.599,hyperplane arrangement with many regions
630.32,3.92,it turns out there are not too many
632.079,3.281,regions and if you can go over these
634.24,3.599,regions
635.36,4.479,and that's the algorithm and select a
637.839,4.161,point from each of these regions
639.839,4.401,and until you select the region when you
642.0,2.959,win the largest amount of points that's
644.24,2.88,the idea
644.959,3.601,the log and this region defines for you
647.12,3.839,some a star b star
648.56,4.32,which is the best response that's the
650.959,4.32,idea in a very simplified
652.88,3.519,setting of this best response algorithm
655.279,3.56,and this can go
656.399,3.601,far when we make to more complicated
658.839,3.961,settings
660.0,3.76,but i'd like to make a comment one thing
662.8,4.0,that i started with
663.76,6.079,is which i would criticize is
666.8,7.12,what about alice you know here
669.839,6.0,the well-defined algorithms you may be
673.92,5.84,very bad predictable for particular
675.839,6.641,instances so it turns out that this
679.76,4.319,type of algorithm can be strengthened if
682.48,4.88,ali's power
684.079,4.88,is similar to whoops to bob's power
687.36,3.68,to our best with sport pump what i mean
688.959,2.88,by that for this particular example of
691.04,3.919,linear
691.839,4.24,systems assume alice uses a linear
694.959,4.161,predictor
696.079,6.0,then the ebr algorithm can be adjusted
699.12,3.839,to output h star such that it will be as
702.079,3.921,before
702.959,5.12,but performs arbitrary close to the
706.0,3.76,opponent's strategy in the classical
708.079,4.32,setting in classical mean square
709.76,3.199,arrow or average arrow stating that you
712.399,2.801,use
712.959,3.201,while having the same runtime complexity
715.2,3.759,so we have some
716.16,4.4,positive news here that we tried on in
718.959,3.921,various kind of setting
720.56,4.8,i started with boston which is simple
722.88,5.759,database but statistician love it
725.36,5.599,so i'll not go over this this
728.639,4.561,what it means is what it's quoted here
730.959,2.801,is that these are the results basically
733.2,3.12,any
733.76,3.759,number that you see here which is above
736.32,4.48,0.5
737.519,4.721,means that this is better than alice
740.8,3.44,alice gain which means this is the
742.24,2.96,proportion of users that you'll be
744.24,2.96,better
745.2,4.319,for them and there are various kind of
747.2,5.36,settings that have been studied here
749.519,6.481,and these numbers is the ratio
752.56,5.44,between what happens under the classical
756.0,3.12,optimization criteria or mean square o
758.0,3.2,in everyday error
759.12,4.159,and the factor close to one means that
761.2,2.56,even on this factor you don't lose so
763.279,2.881,you are
763.76,4.079,behaving like similar to the classic
766.16,4.56,algorithm if you wish
767.839,3.841,but you win a much larger proportion of
770.72,3.84,these users
771.68,4.399,and this as many as we know from real
774.56,1.92,applications that we are involved with
776.079,2.241,as a
776.48,3.44,dramatic verification many of the users
778.32,4.24,try only once
779.92,4.56,these two systems or whatever and decide
782.56,4.719,what to do
784.48,3.359,okay one word about game theory in this
787.279,2.081,kind of
787.839,3.12,example and the other example that i
789.36,3.12,give on our agenda will be much more
790.959,4.401,game theoretic
792.48,5.12,uh work on dwelling algorithms that
795.36,2.64,we've involved already 10 years ago has
797.6,2.88,been
798.0,4.079,extended to best response from best
800.48,2.88,response analytically to minimum
802.079,3.681,strategies in the game
803.36,4.0,so it's not the case that you need to
805.76,2.079,give better response and the other guy
807.36,3.76,just
807.839,5.521,sits here so if you if you
811.12,3.2,if you now make a better search engine
813.36,3.2,for for
814.32,3.759,for being by being a better ranker so
816.56,3.6,google may respond
818.079,4.241,and similarly work on best response
820.16,4.799,regression has been extended to
822.32,3.92,what we call regression equilibria just
824.959,2.56,to give you the following because this
826.24,4.88,is a
827.519,6.801,very applied kind of of a motivation
831.12,4.88,the fact that it's needed think about a
834.32,3.84,cloud provider
836.0,4.079,a big one that basically needs to
838.16,3.359,provide prediction services to several
840.079,5.041,competing parties
841.519,4.481,so you may he he this company this huge
845.12,3.68,company
846.0,3.839,should think about how they respond to
848.8,3.12,one another
849.839,3.201,if you have something which can satisfy
851.92,3.68,several
853.04,3.919,users like that and here comes the idea
855.6,2.799,for questions in bolivia but they will
856.959,4.24,not get into
858.399,3.68,so back to the regular agenda the big
861.199,3.521,agenda here
862.079,3.281,is called data science with miss gate
864.72,2.479,theory
865.36,4.64,and in fact what is written here is the
867.199,3.681,kind of concrete problems in ir applied
870.0,3.44,and l
870.88,3.519,exploration exploitation whatever that
873.44,4.0,we face with
874.399,4.721,and we just gave you an example of what
877.44,3.199,one of the examples that fit into the
879.12,3.44,agent perspective
880.639,3.601,i'd like to best respond to a classical
882.56,5.279,algorithm and
884.24,5.2,you know and and basically defeat
887.839,4.081,now we like to give an example of the
889.44,3.28,mediator perspective the media story is
891.92,2.96,huge
892.72,4.239,because when you talk about mediators we
894.88,3.759,can talk for many times and
896.959,4.081,for a lot of time and much of this has
898.639,5.521,to do with the power of mediators
901.04,4.479,so we worked on in the past in uh under
904.16,4.32,the gateway head
905.519,5.041,under various kinds of mediators media
908.48,3.919,that can enforce some kind of behavior
910.56,2.8,like in social laws for artificial aging
912.399,3.841,societies
913.36,3.2,mediators that just put the setting like
916.24,3.52,in
916.56,4.719,programs or whatever but and media does
919.76,4.72,they can recommend
921.279,5.601,so the issue here for me
924.48,3.28,is that i see mediators everywhere on
926.88,2.8,the web
927.76,3.28,and actually many of them should be
929.68,3.68,revisited given
931.04,4.32,the gt flavor and i'll report on one of
933.36,4.159,them that i've been working
935.36,4.399,more than others because it already
937.519,5.361,showed some practical success
939.759,4.721,and it's a it's a i i owe uh owe
942.88,3.28,a lot to my colleagues in the
944.48,5.52,information retrieval community
946.16,9.039,that i learned from them a lot so
950.0,7.759,our example will be we'll take a smaller
955.199,5.281,smaller theoretical example or stylus
957.759,5.52,example but the actual example that we
960.48,4.799,care about are rankers so for example
963.279,4.641,like that let's take the foreign quote
965.279,4.48,from google self it's written here there
967.92,3.359,that in a fraction of the second google
969.759,3.76,search algorithm so through
971.279,3.36,hundreds of billions of pages in in the
973.519,4.0,in the search engine
974.639,4.961,to find the most relevant useful results
977.519,5.281,for your you are looking for
979.6,6.0,and in fact that's true wonderful
982.8,3.039,but as you can see if you look at that
985.6,2.88,and
985.839,3.761,if you work on on that in the industry
988.48,4.88,at the end you have your
989.6,6.0,game the publishers your strategies
993.36,4.24,which are the documents they write and
995.6,4.08,their payoff are basically at least
997.6,4.159,partially determined by the ranking for
999.68,3.839,different queries
1001.759,3.52,there is a ranking function that is used
1003.519,4.721,by a mediator
1005.279,3.521,this mediator is conceptually very
1008.24,3.12,simple
1008.8,3.36,it's highly complicated it does
1011.36,3.36,something
1012.16,3.84,very efficiently but it actually
1014.72,4.799,implements what is called
1016.0,5.519,the probability ranking principle prp
1019.519,3.76,if you look at nlp by the way that's my
1021.519,3.92,what i'm doing in the last year
1023.279,3.76,it's you have been burning for this and
1025.439,2.961,embedding for this and deserving lecture
1027.039,3.04,the closer one but at the end it's the
1028.4,3.76,probability ranking principle
1030.079,3.36,the prp the most central concept in
1032.16,3.44,professional retrieval
1033.439,3.841,states the document should be ranked by
1035.6,3.439,the relevance to abilities
1037.28,3.679,and care about the highest ranked
1039.039,5.28,documents and
1040.959,6.321,it's not trivial in the paper already
1044.319,4.72,six years by now i feel all this it
1047.28,3.68,turns out that the prp
1049.039,3.76,fails miserably and what is called
1050.96,4.079,adversarial layout setting
1052.799,3.841,establishers are search engine optimizer
1055.039,3.76,search engine optimization is one of the
1056.64,4.159,biggest industries that we have
1058.799,4.321,because they optimize their utility it
1060.799,2.801,can be shown that if you formalize it a
1063.12,2.48,bit
1063.6,4.48,and if often even if you experiment with
1065.6,4.56,it it can be shown that in equilibrium
1068.08,4.24,they will tend to write on similar or
1070.16,3.44,popular subjects you know it from the tv
1072.32,4.239,channels of course
1073.6,5.04,ignoring others which will at things
1076.559,3.521,that and decrease the total use of
1078.64,4.0,social welfare
1080.08,3.92,and in some general settings under other
1082.64,3.68,ranking functions employing
1084.0,4.24,well-defined randomness in the ranking
1086.32,4.16,can be proved to be better with regard
1088.24,4.319,to social user welfare inequity
1090.48,3.6,these are big claims so i'd like to
1092.559,4.641,illustrate you i just
1094.08,4.0,said that someone would like to to read
1097.2,3.68,about this
1098.08,3.599,i i i there are many papers that we have
1100.88,3.2,here
1101.679,3.041,most of them are which i are guys and in
1104.08,4.0,our
1104.72,4.959,forms and i i if you like to read
1108.08,4.2,something without much ir
1109.679,4.0,then i refer to you to cacn paper from
1112.28,3.32,2019
1113.679,4.161,that actually talk about rethinking
1115.6,4.0,search engine and recommendation system
1117.84,4.48,and game theoretical perspective
1119.6,3.36,uh that will distract you the theory
1122.32,3.92,practice
1122.96,5.76,there here i'll again talk about
1126.24,3.28,a paper that talk about recommendation
1128.72,2.959,systems
1129.52,4.08,i fully agreed like i said before you
1131.679,4.401,know the computation is a big thing
1133.6,3.12,the ecosystem accommodation systems that
1136.08,3.2,illustrate
1136.72,4.88,you the same kind of phenomena in
1139.28,5.04,recommendation systems
1141.6,4.4,so think about blocks again realistic
1144.32,3.2,situation people need to decide
1146.0,3.2,bloggers they need to decide on the type
1147.52,3.68,of content to write
1149.2,3.44,and they are users and there is
1151.2,3.44,something that connect them
1152.64,4.0,which is let's call it satisfaction
1154.64,4.159,matrix if you write
1156.64,3.84,write about a particular content and the
1158.799,4.401,user likes it
1160.48,4.0,then even he or she will click so think
1163.2,4.08,about these numbers
1164.48,4.72,player one or publisher one can write
1167.28,3.92,about content x one or x two
1169.2,3.52,why player two can write only about
1171.2,4.56,contact f3
1172.72,4.8,and what will happen here
1175.76,3.76,let's assume the player one will write
1177.52,5.12,about content x1
1179.52,5.519,and see what happened here okay
1182.64,3.2,the classical system the prp the top
1185.039,4.161,system
1185.84,5.76,will give it you know the user that
1189.2,4.24,the content which is more satisfying the
1191.6,5.68,social welfare will be
1193.44,6.08,you can sum up two
1197.28,3.04,and but player one is happy let's assume
1199.52,2.88,that you just
1200.32,4.719,like to maximize impressions for this
1202.4,6.56,stock it has two users
1205.039,6.561,notice that if he would uh
1208.96,3.68,write on that content the social welfare
1211.6,3.28,will be higher
1212.64,4.159,but he will be less happy because he'll
1214.88,4.88,get only one user
1216.799,3.921,so the question again is what should you
1219.76,2.88,do
1220.72,4.319,what what is fair here what is the
1222.64,3.44,dynamics here what is the user utility
1225.039,2.721,or so
1226.08,3.599,should we talk about price of anarchy or
1227.76,3.52,whatever so the approach that we have
1229.679,6.081,taken because we wanted to come
1231.28,7.519,with a concrete suggestion is
1235.76,5.76,like first the model the model really
1238.799,4.561,states in what we said before you have a
1241.52,4.0,set of users a set of players
1243.36,3.28,player j selects one item from the set
1245.52,3.84,of possible content
1246.64,3.519,content types there are profiles as a
1249.36,2.96,game theories
1250.159,4.321,which is the strategy profiles are the
1252.32,4.719,possible content types
1254.48,3.199,each user's satisfaction function from
1257.039,2.481,each content
1257.679,4.161,has particular satisfaction and
1259.52,2.72,immediately though resume mediator take
1261.84,4.0,this
1262.24,4.88,topic of qualities and decide which one
1265.84,3.04,to show
1267.12,4.72,perhaps it can decide not to show
1268.88,7.84,anything and the payoff is just
1271.84,8.24,the expected number of uh times that you
1276.72,5.04,your content is exposed basically that's
1280.08,3.68,that's no one will argue almost with
1281.76,5.36,that so
1283.76,5.279,that's that's the model and what can we
1287.12,3.52,do now what will be a good system i've
1289.039,3.361,shown you that there is some issue with
1290.64,4.8,social welfare versus
1292.4,6.72,i don't know the success of
1295.44,6.0,publishers so basically we
1299.12,3.2,start with design properties one is
1301.44,2.719,called fairness
1302.32,3.839,which i don't like now this term
1304.159,2.481,fairness because therefore this is used
1306.159,2.721,for
1306.64,4.56,real things important things here no one
1308.88,4.56,will argue with our furnace properties
1311.2,3.52,furnace properties here the most extreme
1313.44,3.44,one here says
1314.72,3.28,little mortality the most satisfying
1316.88,3.039,items are displayed
1318.0,3.6,with higher probabilities than the least
1319.919,4.161,satisfying items
1321.6,3.76,so that's something that is minimal
1324.08,4.4,don't be crazy
1325.36,5.6,in your in your properties
1328.48,4.4,or by symmetry if this publisher is
1330.96,2.56,fully symmetric response satisfying the
1332.88,1.679,users
1333.52,4.08,they'll be shown with the same
1334.559,5.6,probability the other one
1337.6,4.0,is a big lesson from the many years in
1340.159,4.081,the ad industry
1341.6,4.319,is called stability you'd like the
1344.24,3.2,system will be stable you don't like to
1345.919,2.161,fluctuate all of the time and people
1347.44,2.479,will send
1348.08,4.24,change the content every every man a
1349.919,5.12,minute it means that any
1352.32,3.04,under any set of players users and items
1355.039,1.921,the
1355.36,3.04,used game should possess a pure
1356.96,3.76,equilibrium in fact you'd like
1358.4,3.04,more you'd like that any dynamics here
1360.72,2.8,will
1361.44,5.44,converge to some equilibrium that will
1363.52,4.88,not get into crazy fluctuations
1366.88,3.12,so basically we started with these
1368.4,3.759,properties
1370.0,4.4,and we'd like to find the mediators that
1372.159,5.041,satisfy these properties
1374.4,5.2,and immediately when we put the this
1377.2,5.28,assumption with the call completeness
1379.6,4.16,that we show an item is displayed with
1382.48,3.04,probability one
1383.76,3.76,we get an impossibility theorem that
1385.52,4.56,says no mediator can satisfy
1387.52,5.2,furnace stability and completeness and
1390.08,5.68,in fact this rule out also the prp
1392.72,4.0,that you know it cannot work it doesn't
1395.76,3.279,satisfy
1396.72,3.76,firmness and stability and we should not
1399.039,2.801,try a different approach
1400.48,3.76,and one of the lessons that i'd like to
1401.84,5.199,give in the very few minutes that i have
1404.24,3.439,is this approach that i think it can go
1407.039,3.441,far
1407.679,3.601,i call it the shuttle immediately uh
1410.48,2.96,basically
1411.28,3.36,bear with me we focus on the arbitrary
1413.44,4.16,user you
1414.64,4.24,and strategy profile x which is a topic
1417.6,3.679,of contents
1418.88,3.44,now given a subset of the players or
1421.279,5.121,subset of the content
1422.32,7.28,c we can define xc to be a restriction
1426.4,6.0,of this profile to the entries in c
1429.6,4.16,so user eye satisfaction from the items
1432.4,3.44,in the players in c
1433.76,4.72,is naturally defined as the maximum
1435.84,4.56,satisfaction from this content
1438.48,4.559,so that's all very natural but in fact
1440.4,4.96,notice that it use a comparative game
1443.039,4.88,you have you have the old possible
1445.36,4.72,coalitions and you have a number at end
1447.919,3.201,which is associated with each uh with
1450.08,3.28,each coalition
1451.12,4.24,and you can look at the sharply value
1453.36,3.84,and basically the shuffling mediator
1455.36,2.799,will be the mediator of the set display
1457.2,3.76,probabilities
1458.159,5.441,according to the sharply value it will
1460.96,5.04,call the sharply mediator
1463.6,3.679,and this sharp remediator has nice
1466.0,4.48,properties
1467.279,6.321,it satisfies fairness
1470.48,4.48,then it also turns out that the game
1473.6,2.8,induced by sharpie mediator is a
1474.96,3.28,potential game
1476.4,3.92,so this means that any better response
1478.24,4.64,dynamic converge
1480.32,4.16,so it satisfies furnaces stability so
1482.88,3.6,the other context as a computer
1484.48,4.0,scientist i've seen sharply used
1486.48,3.439,typically there is a problem because in
1488.48,3.199,general computation of the shuffling
1489.919,4.24,value it shall be hard
1491.679,3.521,and we'd like to be particular so in
1494.159,2.801,this setting
1495.2,3.76,computing dispersabilities under the
1496.96,3.04,shuttle mediator can be done in linear
1498.96,2.719,time
1500.0,3.84,so we are good in fact we have nice
1501.679,4.561,mechanisms and if you like to be
1503.84,3.199,theorists for a minute and you like you
1506.24,3.36,believe in
1507.039,3.441,efficiency defined as the display
1509.6,3.12,probability
1510.48,3.04,is the maximum satisfaction level in
1512.72,3.12,fact you get
1513.52,3.039,that the only mechanism satisfying
1515.84,2.48,furnace
1516.559,4.401,stability and efficiency is the sharp
1518.32,5.04,remediator and to the game theorists
1520.96,3.839,among us there are many i hope this is
1523.36,2.559,not the result of the sharpie
1524.799,5.76,characterization it's
1525.919,7.841,a different characterization of bishop
1530.559,4.321,so so this is more or less what i wanted
1533.76,3.519,to say
1534.88,4.72,but i'd like to emphasize more now about
1537.279,5.841,few minutes about the general picture
1539.6,6.559,so we have many aspects
1543.12,5.84,very realistic aspects where
1546.159,5.361,game theory and i call it data science
1548.96,4.88,not because i'm not a statistician
1551.52,3.84,but i think i'd like to do one to call
1553.84,2.16,it just machine learning you can deploy
1555.36,4.0,machine learning
1556.0,6.72,i've seen it mostly and they are in nlp
1559.36,5.76,and also in things related to
1562.72,4.16,explore and exploit one of the things
1565.12,3.76,that i if i had few more minutes
1566.88,4.159,i'll tell you that another type of
1568.88,4.0,mediator is like plays or whatever
1571.039,3.76,that need to mix exploration
1572.88,3.36,exploitation because there is another
1574.799,4.641,issue the people that
1576.24,5.2,does the exploration is the audience and
1579.44,4.16,i guess that many of you when you go to
1581.44,3.599,a recommendation going somewhere you may
1583.6,3.679,have refused it because i say
1585.039,3.76,it's probably just an exploration so we
1587.279,3.28,need to solve this problem
1588.799,3.12,so there are many concrete problems that
1590.559,4.081,come into play
1591.919,3.681,in search recommendation systems in
1594.64,3.36,regression
1595.6,3.679,in segmentation and all of them has
1598.0,3.039,concrete issues
1599.279,3.361,that we really need to bring into
1601.039,3.681,practice i think it will be better for
1602.64,4.399,the social welfare
1604.72,4.24,so i'll finish with a practical side and
1607.039,4.801,say what if this is implemented
1608.96,4.719,somewhere so we can implement and
1611.84,4.0,already implemented some best response
1613.679,3.521,ai services for prediction segmentation
1615.84,3.12,persuasion we didn't talk about
1617.2,4.56,translation today
1618.96,3.44,uh and another thing which is that the
1621.76,2.32,robust
1622.4,3.68,search recommendation ecosystem
1624.08,3.04,basically it means that it's an
1626.08,4.0,ecosystem
1627.12,5.28,that takes into account uh the publisher
1630.08,4.079,incentives the user incentive and
1632.4,3.12,everyone and like every all of these to
1634.159,3.361,live together
1635.52,3.039,uh other thing that we didn't manage to
1637.52,2.72,talk and we are
1638.559,3.521,involved with this is in welfare
1640.24,3.039,maximizing extraordinary exposed
1642.08,3.44,services
1643.279,7.201,and i think the best is the relics i
1645.52,4.96,i'll just look here
