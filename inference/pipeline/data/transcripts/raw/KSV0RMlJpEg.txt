1.52,4.92,sometimes people ask me why I'm now
3.76,5.919,doing science news it's so that you can
6.44,5.119,fully appreciate the drama of scientific
9.679,3.92,discovery in which one result
11.559,4.921,contradicts a previous one and the next
13.599,5.241,one finds a flaw in this other one I
16.48,3.92,think the entertainment value of science
18.84,3.72,is greatly
20.4,4.199,underappreciated and Quantum Computing
22.56,4.959,is without doubt one of the most
24.599,4.76,dramatic areas at the moment on the one
27.519,4.361,hand you have people claiming it's the
29.359,5.04,next in Industrial Revolution and it's
31.88,4.12,going to change the world and on the
34.399,3.801,other hand you have people saying it's
36.0,5.64,all hype quantum computers are
38.2,6.199,interesting but useless this new paper
41.64,5.88,supports the letter Camp let's have a
44.399,5.68,look quantum computers are devices that
47.52,5.44,exploit Quantum links known as
50.079,4.841,entanglement and know that's not what
52.96,4.88,Einstein meant by spooky action at a
54.92,5.08,distance entanglement doesn't exist in
57.84,4.76,conventional computers and because
60.0,5.88,quantum computers have these additional
62.6,5.96,ways to encode and handle information
65.88,5.32,they can perform some calculations much
68.56,5.28,faster the relevant part of the previous
71.2,5.32,sentence is that they can perform some
73.84,5.639,calculations much faster it isn't the
76.52,5.04,case for all calculations nevertheless
79.479,4.561,the calculations that quantum computers
81.56,5.76,can speed up cover several commercially
84.04,5.88,relevant cases such as quantum chemistry
87.32,5.159,that plays a role in material design and
89.92,5.36,drug development as well as Logistics
92.479,5.401,and finance this is why there are so
95.28,5.68,much hype around quantum computers and
97.88,5.599,that talk about a new Revolution on the
100.96,4.64,other hand there are a lot of practical
103.479,4.801,problems in making quantum computers
105.6,5.24,work I mean besides the problem that no
108.28,5.04,one understands quantum mechanics though
110.84,5.08,there's that the real issue is that
113.32,5.96,these Quantum links are incredibly
115.92,6.119,fragile depending on how you create them
119.28,5.479,they might last micros seconds to a few
122.039,5.161,seconds but that's about it and your
124.759,5.72,calculation needs to be done within that
127.2,5.24,time and I mean I do calculations for my
130.479,4.361,financial management within a few
132.44,4.799,microseconds but it's probably not a
134.84,5.36,good thing there are many approaches to
137.239,5.441,Quantum Computing that differ by how you
140.2,5.28,physically realize the quantum bits
142.68,5.4,cubits for short I've talked about this
145.48,5.039,in several previous episodes but all
148.08,5.08,these approaches have this problem in
150.519,5.121,common the quantum information is very
153.16,5.999,sensitive to disturbances which brings
155.64,5.64,in errors these errors can be avoided by
159.159,4.881,introducing redundancies but that
161.28,5.2,requires making the computers larger
164.04,4.479,which brings in more problems what this
166.48,4.56,means is that the need for error
168.519,5.761,correction moves useful quantum
171.04,6.44,computers further into the future and no
174.28,5.2,one knows how far that's unappealing for
177.48,4.44,investors and this is why in the past
179.48,5.16,year some physicists like for example
181.92,5.319,John presco have pushed the idea that
184.64,5.28,even noisy quantum computers can be good
187.239,4.841,for something if that was true it would
189.92,4.16,do a lot against the criticism that
192.08,5.719,Quantum Computing applications are far
194.08,6.76,away and might remain far away forever
197.799,5.16,last summer IBM said they'd done it
200.84,4.679,they'd done something useful with a
202.959,5.441,noisy quantum computer and the New York
205.519,5.561,Times celebrated this success the new
208.4,6.44,paper now puts the the IBM achievement
211.08,6.68,into doubt so H you see the drama in
214.84,5.36,last year's paper the IBM team explains
217.76,5.479,how they used a noisy Quantum processor
220.2,5.16,with 127 cubits called The Eagle
223.239,4.761,processor to calculate what's called
225.36,6.0,theorized time evolution of a 2d
228.0,5.959,transverse fi ising model the ising
231.36,5.4,model is a model of coupled Quantum
233.959,5.801,spins and the terized transverse field
236.76,5.72,and means it's a special version this
239.76,4.839,model is interesting if you find that
242.48,4.28,kind of model interesting to my best
244.599,4.081,knowledge it doesn't have any uses
246.76,3.44,however the type of calculation is
248.68,3.72,difficult to do on a conventional
250.2,5.28,computer which is what makes it an
252.4,5.119,interesting test the IBM group claimed
255.48,4.56,that their Quantum chip
257.519,4.921,outperformed any calculation that could
260.04,5.439,be done on a conventional computer and
262.44,5.36,that quote there is indeed Merit to
265.479,4.601,pursuing research towards deriving a
267.8,5.48,practical computational advantage from
270.08,5.2,noise limited Quantum circuits the
273.28,4.96,authors of the new paper now say that
275.28,5.359,IBM was somewhat over optimistic they
278.24,4.92,found a way to do the calculation on a
280.639,5.921,conventional computer and they managed
283.16,6.24,to do it faster and better than IBM
286.56,4.8,could on their noisy computer basically
289.4,5.04,they show that conventional computers
291.36,6.24,outperform the quantum computer also on
294.44,5.88,this task they write we can perform a
297.6,4.879,classical simulation that significantly
300.32,4.159,more accurate and precise than the
302.479,4.401,results obtained from the quantum
304.479,4.361,processor you can see this very nicely
306.88,4.64,in this figure where the dots with the
308.84,5.56,arrow bars are from the quantum computer
311.52,6.04,and the smooth line going through them
314.4,6.519,is from the new calculation so another
317.56,5.759,supposed Quantum achievement gun that's
320.919,4.641,happened a few times before that one
323.319,4.72,group claimed they'd done something
325.56,4.72,spectacular on a quantum computer just
328.039,4.961,that later another group did it on a
330.28,5.919,conventional computer the most prominent
333.0,6.44,example was probably Google's 2019 claim
336.199,5.481,that they had proved a Quantum Advantage
339.44,4.479,back then the scientists from Google
341.68,5.519,published a paper in nature claiming
343.919,5.84,they'd done a calculation on a 53 Cubit
347.199,5.921,quantum computer which would have taken
349.759,5.761,"10,000 years on a conventional computer"
353.12,4.72,"the 10,000 years claim was swiftly"
355.52,4.36,questioned by IBM and indeed it was
357.84,5.76,later done by Chinese group on a
359.88,5.8,conventional computer in only 5 minutes
363.6,4.36,then again maybe that just means that
365.68,4.88,"10,000 years in Silicon Valley are worth"
367.96,4.72,5 minutes in China this new result
370.56,3.919,matters because it's once again showing
372.68,4.28,that conventional computers are so
374.479,4.761,Advanced already that there are very
376.96,4.6,strong competition for quantum computers
379.24,4.519,and that'll probably remain so for quite
381.56,4.52,some time to come this is really bad
