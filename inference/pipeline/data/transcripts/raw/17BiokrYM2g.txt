0.24,3.28,in any business anticipating and
2.159,4.321,planning for what's next
3.52,4.319,is crucial for success and when caring
6.48,3.119,for someone's health
7.839,3.84,predicting what's ahead has the
9.599,5.04,potential to save lives
11.679,4.801,that's why we've launched catalyst.ai
14.639,3.841,and healthcare.ai
16.48,3.84,an initiative that will make machine
18.48,3.84,learning and predictive analytics
20.32,3.52,widely available across all of
22.32,4.0,healthcare
23.84,4.08,today we've observed that only the
26.32,3.039,largest health systems have the
27.92,3.359,resources to build
29.359,3.601,staff and play in the predictive
31.279,4.561,analytics sandbox
32.96,4.8,and with such demand for data scientists
35.84,2.64,having the right people on board is
37.76,4.56,either cost
38.48,6.0,prohibitive unsustainable or impossible
42.32,3.68,at health catalyst we believe these
44.48,3.919,life-saving technologies
46.0,4.12,should be made available everywhere
48.399,5.441,that's why we developed
50.12,5.64,catalyst.ai with catalyst.ai
53.84,4.48,machine learning models are designed and
55.76,4.799,built into each product we deliver
58.32,3.44,so caregivers can now easily make
60.559,4.0,predictive analytics
61.76,3.52,routine and actionable imagine how
64.559,2.801,valuable
65.28,4.24,access to data-driven machine learning
67.36,3.52,could be for a caregiver like dr
69.52,4.16,martinez
70.88,3.599,utilizing machine learning dr martinez
73.68,3.28,can uncover
74.479,4.481,patterns in her own patient data she and
76.96,2.96,her colleagues could identify the best
78.96,3.28,interventions
79.92,3.92,to reduce a patient's length of stay
82.24,4.48,avert the next readmission
83.84,3.76,or the next deadly infection all based
86.72,3.28,on a patient's
87.6,5.6,specific risk factors she could even
90.0,4.88,prevent the next onset of diabetes
93.2,3.76,we also want to make these benefits
94.88,4.4,available to anyone in healthcare
96.96,3.119,not just our customers so we took our
99.28,4.0,technology
100.079,5.441,and learning and created healthcare.ai
103.28,4.32,the industry's first collaborative open
105.52,4.879,source repository of machine learning
107.6,5.199,software and expertise
110.399,4.481,by making an easy to use software
112.799,3.28,package that automates key machine
114.88,3.279,learning tasks
116.079,3.36,we've made machine learning accessible
118.159,3.28,and democratized
119.439,4.601,without requiring advanced technical
121.439,4.881,skills to get started
124.04,4.52,healthcare.ai also allows data
126.32,4.4,professionals who know healthcare data
128.56,3.039,but who may not be deeply experienced in
130.72,3.44,machine learning
131.599,3.121,to uncover hidden insights by quickly
134.16,4.04,creating
134.72,4.64,and deploying complex models and because
138.2,3.32,healthcare.ai
139.36,3.44,is a community resource for learning
141.52,4.16,weekly broadcasts
142.8,4.4,and interactive collaboration access to
145.68,4.4,machine learning and healthcare
147.2,4.48,is now available for everyone just like
150.08,4.159,dr martinez
151.68,4.639,at health catalyst we know outcomes and
154.239,3.441,we know how data is used to drive
156.319,4.081,outcomes improvement
157.68,3.199,with catalyst.ai we bring machine
160.4,2.88,learning
160.879,4.561,into all of our products products that
163.28,4.0,are used to drive better outcomes for
165.44,4.079,our customers
167.28,3.36,with healthcare ai we've brought machine
169.519,3.601,learning tools to
170.64,4.239,everyone to lower the barriers of entry
173.12,3.44,for using predictive analytics to
174.879,5.44,accelerate outcomes improvement
176.56,6.48,industry-wide together catalyst.ai
180.319,5.121,and healthcare.ai represent the next
183.04,4.8,generation of healthcare analytics
185.44,4.24,because in today's value-based world
187.84,4.479,relying on historical data
189.68,3.76,simply isn't good enough caregivers like
192.319,3.441,dr martinez
193.44,3.2,can utilize these tools to map a patient
195.76,3.28,care plan
196.64,3.84,that accounts for not only what risks
199.04,3.76,lay directly ahead
200.48,10.8,but also for those lurking just around
202.8,8.48,the corner
