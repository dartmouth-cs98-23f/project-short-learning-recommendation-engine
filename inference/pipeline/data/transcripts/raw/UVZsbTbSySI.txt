9.2,4.479,good day so welcome to our virtual class
12.4,3.84,week one
13.679,5.041,our top today is about
16.24,4.959,introduction to human computer
18.72,4.799,interaction
21.199,4.16,in everyday life or in every day we
23.519,2.721,interact with many things like cell
25.359,3.84,phone
26.24,5.199,tv remote easy remote keyboard mouse and
29.199,4.721,other devices like atm
31.439,5.041,web or mobile application which is part
33.92,4.72,of our life sometimes we take time to
36.48,4.96,understand the design and sometimes we
38.64,5.52,don't take time it to understand
41.44,4.639,so it's about poor and good design
44.16,5.28,interaction is the connection between
46.079,5.201,the user and the device or application
49.44,4.08,interaction design is concerned with
51.28,4.4,designing interactive products to
53.52,4.64,support people in their everyday and
55.68,4.32,working lives interaction design is a
58.16,5.28,big business
60.0,3.44,in every company
66.08,7.2,so what is a human computer interaction
70.479,4.401,hci is the study and the practice of
73.28,4.8,usability
74.88,8.16,hdi is the study of how people use
78.08,7.64,computer system to perform certain tasks
83.04,5.28,human computer interaction is a
85.72,4.52,multi-disciplinary field of study
88.32,4.159,focusing on the design of the computer
90.24,4.48,technology and in particular the
92.479,4.401,interaction between human
94.72,3.68,the user and the computer
96.88,4.64,while initially concerned with the
98.4,5.999,computers hci has since expanded to
101.52,4.8,cover almost all forms of information
104.399,4.561,technology design
106.32,4.88,human computer interaction is an area of
108.96,4.88,research and practice that emerged in
111.2,5.04,the early 1980s
113.84,4.959,initially as a specialty area in
116.24,5.36,computer science embracing cognitive
118.799,6.401,science and human factor engineering
121.6,5.28,hci has expanded rapidly and steadily
125.2,3.839,for three decades
126.88,4.4,attracting professionals from many other
129.039,4.241,disciplines and incorporating diverse
131.28,5.039,concepts and approaches
133.28,4.52,by considerable extent each cis now
136.319,4.081,aggregates a collection of
137.8,5.88,semi-autonomous field of research and
140.4,5.36,practice in human-centered informatics
143.68,4.16,however the continuing
145.76,4.24,synthesis
147.84,4.56,of display conception and approaches to
150.0,4.959,science and practice in hcis has
152.4,5.44,produced a dramatic example of how
154.959,5.521,different epistemologies and paradigms
157.84,5.2,can be concealed and integrated in a
160.48,4.96,vibrant and productive intellectual
163.04,2.4,project
166.48,4.72,again so what is human computer
168.0,5.68,interaction hci concerning
171.2,4.16,process which design evaluation and
173.68,4.559,implementation
175.36,4.48,process on interactive computing system
178.239,4.801,for human use
179.84,6.16,plus the study of major phenomena
183.04,2.96,surrounding them
192.72,4.56,so the goal of hci
195.12,4.8,are to produce usable
197.28,5.12,and safe system as well as functional
199.92,4.48,system in order
202.4,4.559,to produce a computer system with good
204.4,4.64,usability developer must attempt to
206.959,4.961,first understand the factors that
209.04,5.199,determine how people use technology
211.92,5.76,develop tools and techniques enable
214.239,5.521,building suitable system
217.68,3.52,achieve efficient and effective and safe
219.76,2.559,interaction
221.2,2.88,and put
222.319,4.56,people purse
224.08,4.879,so underlying the whole theme of hci is
226.879,5.041,the belief that people using computer
228.959,5.601,system should come first so their needs
231.92,5.039,capabilities and preference for
234.56,4.959,product uh conducting various styles
236.959,4.48,should direct developers in the way
239.519,4.401,that they design system
241.439,4.72,people should not have to change the way
243.92,4.8,that they use a system in order to fit
246.159,7.401,within it instead the system should be
248.72,4.84,designed to match their requirements
255.28,4.0,okay so the goal of hci ensuring
257.68,3.76,usability
259.28,4.56,a usable software system is that
261.44,5.039,supports the effective and efficient
263.84,6.4,completion of tasks in a given work
266.479,5.681,context by carton daton in 1985 so the
270.24,4.88,bottom line benefits a more usable
272.16,5.52,software system to business user include
275.12,5.68,first increase productivity
277.68,5.2,decrease user training time and costs
280.8,3.52,decrease
282.88,4.16,user errors
284.32,5.76,increase accuracy of data input data
287.04,5.28,interpretation decrease need for ongoing
290.08,5.52,technical support
292.32,6.56,so the bottom line benefits of usability
295.6,5.52,to develop organizations include greater
298.88,3.44,profits due to more competitive products
301.12,3.359,and services
302.32,3.68,decrease overall development and
304.479,4.081,maintenance costs
306.0,4.88,decrease the customer support costs
308.56,4.639,more power business due to satisfied
310.88,4.24,customer so not to use a term user
313.199,4.641,friendly which is tended to mean a
315.12,5.12,system with high usability but always
317.84,7.919,misinterpreted to mean tidying up the
320.24,8.32,screen display to make it more missing
325.759,5.841,okay so when we say usability okay it's
328.56,5.6,one of the key concept in hci
331.6,4.4,it is concerned with making the system
334.16,4.8,easy to learn and use
336.0,4.72,so a usable system is again
338.96,4.16,easy to learn
340.72,4.0,easy to remember how to use
343.12,3.12,effective to use
344.72,5.12,efficient to use
346.24,6.16,safe to use and enjoyable to use
349.84,3.84,so another question is why usability is
352.4,3.84,important
353.68,4.48,so many everyday system and products
356.24,3.76,seems to be designed with a little
358.16,4.479,regard to usability
360.0,4.08,this leads to persuasion we said times
362.639,3.84,an error
364.08,3.679,this contains example of interactive
366.479,4.081,products
367.759,5.44,mobile phone computer personal organizer
370.56,5.28,remote control sublink machine copy
373.199,4.481,machine atm ticket machine library
375.84,5.6,information system
377.68,4.88,uh photocopier okay
381.44,2.96,so
382.56,6.479,how many of these systems are actually
384.4,4.639,effortless and enjoyable to use okay
389.68,6.56,so the goal of hci to achieve usability
393.199,5.12,the design of the user interface to any
396.24,4.16,interactive product needs to take into
398.319,4.561,account and to be tailored around a
400.4,4.32,number of factors including first
402.88,4.64,cognitive perceptual and motor
404.72,5.12,capabilities and contains of people in
407.52,2.32,general
413.039,4.641,second spatial a unique characteristic
415.919,3.28,of the intended user population in
417.68,3.84,particular
419.199,4.72,unique characteristic of user physical
421.52,4.399,and social work environment
423.919,3.761,unique characteristic and requirements
425.919,3.84,of the user tasks which are being
427.68,4.0,supported by the software
429.759,3.84,unique capabilities and constraint of
431.68,7.12,the chosen software
433.599,5.201,and or hardware platform for the product
439.039,4.88,so nowadays human cognitive aspects have
441.52,4.16,become more and more important for
443.919,4.161,interaction design
445.68,5.359,cognition refers to what goes on in
448.08,4.959,human mind when they carry out everyday
451.039,4.56,activities so it involves sets of
453.039,5.361,cognitive processes such as thinking
455.599,4.16,remembering learning and decision making
458.4,3.76,through the study of this human
459.759,4.56,cognitive process the developer of
462.16,3.84,interaction system can be better at
464.319,3.761,understanding user
466.0,4.639,psychological characteristics during the
468.08,3.6,process of interacting with computer
470.639,3.28,system
471.68,5.12,it is crucial for the developer to
473.919,4.881,design high quality interaction system
476.8,4.72,which make the interaction between the
478.8,4.16,user and the system more effective and
481.52,3.92,efficiently
482.96,4.239,this presentation will uh
485.44,4.0,explain what cognition is and why it's
487.199,4.0,important for interaction design
489.44,3.84,but this may take a cognitive process
491.199,4.161,interaction example to explain how
493.28,3.12,cognition applied to the
495.36,3.679,inter
496.4,4.799,action design
499.039,4.88,a human computer interaction has
501.199,5.44,generally been seen as a discipline that
503.919,5.441,identifies principles and techniques for
506.639,4.96,designing and evaluating user interface
509.36,4.64,and human computer system
511.599,4.481,there are many reasons for difficult
514.0,4.839,difficulty in developing a strong
516.08,5.28,scientific basis for human computer
518.839,4.76,interaction users are people without
521.36,2.96,shaded in psychological characteristic
523.599,3.761,and
524.32,5.6,diversity diversity
527.36,4.96,however psychology as a discipline has
529.92,4.88,yet to describe fully the function and
532.32,4.8,the properties of human person let alone
534.8,4.8,the function and properties of people
537.12,4.96,interacting with the complex technology
539.6,4.64,this means that each application and
542.08,4.96,software interface represent an
544.24,5.12,experiment so we'll be able to spot an
547.04,4.96,obvious problem with an interface using
549.36,3.919,general principles such as stimulus
552.0,4.24,response
553.279,2.961,compatibility
556.959,4.401,so human computer interaction
559.519,3.121,okay so the h
561.36,3.84,the human
562.64,5.6,goods at sensing low level simulated
565.2,5.84,pattern recognition inductive reasoning
568.24,5.36,multiple strategies adapting hazard
571.04,4.08,advancing
573.6,4.56,so human
575.12,5.12,or the in computer interaction
578.16,4.32,again is the study of people interact
580.24,4.48,with the computer and to what extent
582.48,5.039,computers are not developed for
584.72,4.559,successful interaction with human being
587.519,3.281,let's name hc
589.279,4.24,of three parts against
590.8,5.2,the user the computer itself and the way
593.519,5.76,they work together
596.0,3.279,then we have the computer
601.6,4.08,okay so the
602.839,5.0,computer good accounting and measuring
605.68,4.48,accurate storage and recall rapid
607.839,5.361,increase consistent responsive data
610.16,6.08,processing calculation repetitive action
613.2,6.24,performance over time simple and sharply
616.24,5.12,defined things
619.44,4.399,when we talk about computer we're
621.36,5.28,referring to any technology ranging from
623.839,3.841,desktop computer to large scale computer
626.64,2.879,system
627.68,4.0,for example we were discussing the
629.519,4.32,design of a website then the website
631.68,5.2,itself would be reverse referred as the
633.839,6.081,computer so divide such as mobile phones
636.88,4.48,or b cr can also be considered to be a
639.92,3.52,computer
641.36,4.4,then the i that is skill somewhat
643.44,5.28,complementary that human do what human
645.76,5.28,do best and computer do what computer do
648.72,2.32,best
652.0,3.839,so by the user we may mean the
653.519,4.88,individual user group or user working
655.839,5.281,together and appreciation the way people
658.399,6.0,sensor system example site hearing and
661.12,5.44,touch relay information is a vital also
664.399,4.801,different user from different conception
666.56,4.719,or mental models about their interaction
669.2,4.879,and have different ways of learning and
671.279,7.921,keeping knowledge in addition cultural
674.079,5.121,and national differences play also apart
680.48,7.16,okay next we have the three broad
682.48,5.16,categories of a computer system
689.12,4.959,okay
690.72,3.359,so we have
697.12,4.0,okay so we have the
698.72,4.16,first the expert user
701.12,5.04,with detailed knowledge of the
702.88,3.28,particular system
707.279,5.68,so the expert user with the detailed
710.48,4.159,knowledge of the particular system so
712.959,4.88,expert user
714.639,5.681,are defined as individuals who reach uh
717.839,5.44,interaction knowledge past knowledge and
720.32,5.92,domain knowledge specific system and who
723.279,5.68,are skillful in obtaining and using such
726.24,4.24,knowledge to achieve goals or tasks in
728.959,5.041,an interaction
730.48,5.84,then we have the occasional users
734.0,6.16,who know well how to perform the tasks
736.32,5.36,they need to perform frequently
740.16,2.64,occasional user
741.68,3.44,okay so
742.8,4.88,this user will learn only enough about
745.12,5.44,the system to accomplish their immediate
747.68,4.88,needs or specific needs the occasional
750.56,4.0,user someone with a human service
752.56,4.24,organization would only need to use a
754.56,6.24,particular information system on
756.8,6.08,occasional rather than irregular disease
760.8,4.8,then we have the last one we have the
762.88,4.0,novice who are never used the system
765.6,3.6,before
766.88,5.12,okay so i know guys it's a broad sense
769.2,5.28,you know it's a person who is new or is
772.0,4.88,inexperienced in a certain task or
774.48,4.88,situation maybe sends a label embrace
776.88,4.959,the other levels like beginners or a new
779.36,4.88,user of the system
781.839,6.0,a novice user is not familiar
784.24,3.599,with the system operation
790.32,4.0,so teaching user interface development
793.04,5.2,to software
794.32,6.319,engineers gary verman on ohio university
798.24,4.159,there are not many specialists in user
800.639,4.481,interface development
802.399,4.801,so most software user interface are
805.12,3.519,designed and built by the software
807.2,3.439,engineers
808.639,4.401,software engineers who have been trained
810.639,5.041,in user interface development should
813.04,4.96,have gained perspective
815.68,4.88,learn about methods and tools and gain
818.0,4.399,an appreciation of their limits
820.56,4.32,so their perspective should include the
822.399,4.8,importance of the user interface
824.88,5.36,the impact of good
827.199,7.121,and bad user interface and the diversity
830.24,4.08,of user and application
835.36,4.88,so about methods and tools they should
837.68,4.959,know the trade-offs of design decision
840.24,4.959,involving different dialogue types and
842.639,3.521,input output device the information
845.199,3.281,resource
846.16,4.799,resources available for design the
848.48,4.96,benefit and cost of developing tools for
850.959,4.401,user interface implementation they need
853.44,3.44,to integrate training materials with the
855.36,4.159,user interface
856.88,4.88,the need to evaluate system usability
859.519,3.841,and information about some design and
861.76,4.48,evaluation tools
863.36,5.52,finally software engineers building user
866.24,5.36,interface must know the limits of their
868.88,5.36,knowledge when and how to work with
871.6,4.799,human partners engineers as a consultant
874.24,4.0,for design and evaluation
876.399,4.401,when and how to work with technical
878.24,5.76,writers for implementation of a system
880.8,5.44,of a user guidance when and how to work
884.0,4.639,a statistical consultant and the
886.24,5.2,difficulty of measuring measurement and
888.639,6.161,the complexity of making decision
891.44,3.36,decision-based data
895.36,5.279,user interface is the product
897.279,5.68,application view to which user interacts
900.639,4.481,in order to use the software
902.959,5.12,user can manipulate and control the
905.12,4.56,software as well as hardware by means of
908.079,2.721,user interface
909.68,3.279,today
910.8,4.719,user interface is found almost every
912.959,5.281,place where digital technology exists
915.519,5.521,right from the computers mobile phones
918.24,3.839,cars music players airplane ships and
921.04,4.08,more
922.079,4.801,so user interface is a part of software
925.12,4.959,and is designed such a way that is
926.88,4.48,expected to provide the user inside of
930.079,3.921,the software
931.36,5.12,a user interface or the ui
934.0,4.24,provides fundamental platform for human
936.48,4.719,computer interaction
938.24,3.76,so user interface can be a graphical
941.199,3.361,uh
942.0,4.56,it can be text based audio based
944.56,3.68,depending upon the underlying hardware
946.56,3.76,and software combination
948.24,4.719,so user interface can be hardware or
950.32,4.639,software or combination of both
952.959,5.601,okay so the software becomes more
954.959,5.521,popular in user interface it becomes
958.56,4.24,more attractive
960.48,4.719,simple to use
962.8,4.64,responsive in short time
965.199,5.841,and clear to understand
967.44,5.519,consistent at all interfacing screen
971.04,4.4,a bad
972.959,4.8,user interface design totally destroyed
975.44,3.839,the creativity behind the designers but
977.759,3.841,also deliver
979.279,3.441,delivers misunderstanding input to the
981.6,3.359,user
982.72,5.2,all of those altogether bring user a
984.959,6.961,sense of confusion for station and even
987.92,4.0,sometimes anger okay
994.16,6.239,again the the visibility and affordable
997.279,5.92,so visibility is what is seen
1000.399,6.24,affordance is what operation and
1003.199,4.721,manipulation can be done to a particular
1006.639,4.081,project
1007.92,4.96,so what is visible must have a good
1010.72,4.08,mapping to their effect
1012.88,4.079,and perceive a part of perceived
1014.8,5.68,affordance what a person thinks can be
1016.959,3.521,done to an object
1021.12,4.64,again uh visibility
1023.279,4.8,is the basic principle that
1025.76,5.199,the more visible an element is the more
1028.079,4.161,likely user will know about them and how
1030.959,3.6,to use them
1032.24,4.959,equally important in the opposite when
1034.559,4.961,sometimes out of sight it's difficult to
1037.199,4.801,know about the use as simple as this
1039.52,3.76,principle it's simon struggle with
1042.0,3.52,adopting it
1043.28,5.36,and when we say accordance this is the
1045.52,6.32,appearance of a specific control such as
1048.64,6.159,function for example apply
1051.84,4.079,okay when you see a floppy disk icon
1054.799,4.481,so
1055.919,4.241,this is uh this is just a save button
1059.28,3.36,okay
1060.16,5.6,so visibility the control is visible to
1062.64,6.56,the user who they know it's available
1065.76,4.96,okay and while accordance the image used
1069.2,4.16,for the control
1070.72,5.28,suggests its function
1073.36,4.72,okay so visibility should be obvious
1076.0,5.679,what a control used for
1078.08,5.28,so for example if i press this button so
1081.679,3.521,what will happen
1083.36,3.679,if i want to unlock the door which
1085.2,5.04,control should i use
1087.039,5.601,a system with good visibility visibility
1090.24,4.319,allows the user to easily translate
1092.64,4.0,goals into
1094.559,3.681,action
1096.64,4.399,while affordance
1098.24,5.52,it should be obvious how to control its
1101.039,5.601,use okay so the system should provide a
1103.76,6.56,strong clues to the operation of a thing
1106.64,5.76,example a button upwards pushing a lever
1110.32,4.479,uh upwards pulling so the user should
1112.4,3.68,know how to operate or control just by
1114.799,2.321,looking at it
1116.08,3.04,okay
1117.12,4.559,then
1119.12,4.88,when you say feedback okay it should be
1121.679,5.601,obvious when a controller has been used
1124.0,4.64,so once the user has press a button okay
1127.28,3.519,the system
1128.64,3.919,should react in a manner that clearly
1130.799,4.24,communicates what has just been
1132.559,5.041,accomplished if nothing happened so this
1135.039,4.801,part should be also obvious for example
1137.6,3.92,when you say profile okay so there will
1139.84,4.079,be a message that
1141.52,5.12,your file is successfully seen
1143.919,2.721,or you delete
1147.919,5.681,so importance of hci hci will be
1151.36,3.6,increasingly important in the following
1153.6,3.199,areas
1154.96,4.959,as a part of software development
1156.799,5.76,process and system design methods
1159.919,6.241,as a part of a future legal requirements
1162.559,6.321,for software as a basis for a set of
1166.16,5.6,usability criteria to evaluate and
1168.88,5.2,choose from amongst competitive products
1171.76,5.6,as the basis for successful marketing
1174.08,5.76,strategy to the increasingly important
1177.36,4.88,and important home and small business
1179.84,2.4,user
1182.96,5.52,hci is a very important because it will
1185.84,4.24,be a fundamental to make product more
1188.48,4.559,successful
1190.08,5.28,safe useful and functional so in the
1193.039,4.0,long run it will make more pleasurable
1195.36,3.6,for the user
1197.039,4.481,hence it's important to have someone
1198.96,4.32,with hci focus skills involved in all
1201.52,3.12,places of any product of a system
1203.28,4.0,development
1204.64,6.399,hci is also important to avoid product
1207.28,5.6,or project going wrong or totally clear
1211.039,4.64,so it's extremely important when
1212.88,5.679,designing a clear inductive system which
1215.679,5.761,be usable for people with a varied range
1218.559,5.761,of abilities and expertise and who have
1221.44,5.2,not completed any formal training
1224.32,4.8,hci takes advantage of our everyday
1226.64,5.279,knowledge of the world to make software
1229.12,6.64,and devices more understandable and
1231.919,6.481,usable for everyone for example using a
1235.76,5.6,graphic of a miniature folder in a
1238.4,5.6,computer interface helps the user
1241.36,4.559,understand the power force of the folder
1244.0,6.159,as everyone's experience with a real
1245.919,4.24,paper called their day everyday life
1252.72,5.04,so relationship of the hci to other
1256.48,4.319,discipline
1257.76,6.32,hci is a multidisciplinary field
1260.799,5.281,so hci draws expertise from a number of
1264.08,4.88,different areas of studies
1266.08,3.68,only first we have prototyping
1268.96,5.839,and
1269.76,5.039,iterative development from a software
1275.12,5.28,okay so a prototype is an early sample
1278.08,5.2,model or release of a product build to
1280.4,4.08,test a concept or process or to act as a
1283.28,3.279,thing to be
1284.48,3.6,applicated or learn from
1286.559,4.321,it's a term used to a variety of
1288.08,5.2,contexts including semantics design
1290.88,4.56,electronics and software programming so
1293.28,4.879,prototype is designed to test and try a
1295.44,3.76,new design to enhance precision by a
1298.159,3.681,system
1299.2,4.719,analyst and a user
1301.84,4.48,in prototyping it allows members of the
1303.919,4.321,development team to clean confirm
1306.32,4.08,whether the product interface can be
1308.24,3.919,easily learned and use
1310.4,4.8,so the goal for rapid prototyping
1312.159,5.041,include conducting iterative testing and
1315.2,5.44,revision in early product development
1317.2,6.4,cycle so this approach allows user
1320.64,5.36,testing to be integral part of a product
1323.6,4.16,design
1326.0,4.96,next we have a
1327.76,6.399,software psychology and human factor
1330.96,5.599,of computing system
1334.159,4.88,okay so hci or the human computer
1336.559,5.041,interaction study is a region of
1339.039,4.321,intersection between psychology and the
1341.6,3.6,social science
1343.36,3.679,on the other hand the computer science
1345.2,4.0,and technology and the other
1347.039,4.721,hdi researchers analyze and design
1349.2,5.28,specific user interface technologies for
1351.76,4.08,example a pointing device so they study
1354.48,3.199,and improve the process of the
1355.84,3.68,technology development
1357.679,3.841,so they develop and evaluate new
1359.52,4.639,application of technology
1361.52,5.039,throughout the past two decades the agi
1364.159,4.321,has progressively integrated its
1366.559,4.081,scientific concern with the engineering
1368.48,4.88,goal of improving the usability of
1370.64,4.72,computer system an application which has
1373.36,4.08,resulted in a body of technical
1375.36,4.559,knowledge and methodology
1377.44,4.64,hcis continue to provide a challenging
1379.919,4.801,test domain to applying developing
1382.08,5.28,psychological and social jury in the
1384.72,4.8,context of technology and development
1387.36,4.319,and use
1389.52,4.88,okay
1391.679,5.841,next we have user interface of software
1394.4,6.159,from computer graphics
1397.52,6.08,an important part facet of hci is the
1400.559,6.48,securing of user satisfaction or simply
1403.6,5.68,end user computing satisfaction because
1407.039,5.281,human computer interaction studies a
1409.28,4.879,human and machine communication it grows
1412.32,2.8,from supporting knowledge of both the
1414.159,2.801,machine
1415.12,3.76,and a human side
1416.96,4.64,so poorly designed human machine
1418.88,5.12,interface can lead to many honest
1421.6,4.72,unexpected problems
1424.0,4.48,the hci is very important because it
1426.32,4.08,will be the fundamental to make a
1428.48,4.72,product more successful
1430.4,4.8,safe useful and
1433.2,4.8,functional
1435.2,6.959,so that's the model tourist and
1438.0,4.159,framework from cognitive science
1442.24,4.559,cognitive modeling is an area of
1444.48,4.64,computer science that deal with
1446.799,5.281,similarly simulating human problem
1449.12,5.36,solving and mental processing in a
1452.08,3.76,computerized model such a model can be
1454.48,4.0,used to
1455.84,4.8,simulate or predict human behavior or
1458.48,4.48,performance and similar to other one's
1460.64,3.84,models and improve human computer
1462.96,4.0,interaction
1464.48,5.28,uh human computer interaction is an
1466.96,5.04,emerging branch of pupil computer
1469.76,5.12,which is concerned with how people
1472.0,5.6,interact with all the process
1474.88,5.44,outwardly accessible information as a
1477.6,5.12,worldwide web however it adapts
1480.32,4.32,information centric approach rather than
1482.72,4.4,computer setting approach to the field
1484.64,5.2,of human computer interaction
1487.12,5.12,like hci it's it's an application pill
1489.84,4.48,that provides complex textbooks for
1492.24,3.52,tourism of cognitive outrage
1494.32,3.2,architecture
1495.76,4.32,so it turns that shooters provide the
1497.52,4.88,basis for cognitive engineering models
1500.08,4.4,that can yield prediction about the
1502.4,5.36,technology and
1504.48,3.28,information design
1508.559,5.841,okay so the topic in hci
1511.2,5.04,is a user what or social organization
1514.4,4.639,and what we have the youth or the user
1516.24,5.12,to the application areas and the u3
1519.039,3.921,which is the human machine pit
1521.36,3.199,adaptation
1522.96,4.16,okay
1524.559,4.321,so computer exists uh with a larger
1527.12,3.28,social organization
1528.88,5.36,word menu
1530.4,5.68,or the social organization work
1534.24,4.559,so within this context there are
1536.08,4.4,applications for which we wish to employ
1538.799,2.88,computer system
1540.48,3.52,which is the
1541.679,5.281,application area
1544.0,5.36,but the process of putting computer to
1546.96,4.959,work means that the human technical and
1549.36,5.28,work aspect of the application situation
1551.919,4.88,must be brought into pit with each other
1554.64,3.68,through human learning system
1556.799,4.88,tailorability
1558.32,5.04,or the other strategy
1561.679,6.081,or the machine
1563.36,4.4,human machine fit and adaptation
1568.559,5.281,in addition to the use of social context
1570.96,5.12,of computer on human side we must also
1573.84,3.439,take into account the human information
1576.08,4.16,processing
1577.279,7.961,h1 the communication and the physical
1580.24,5.0,and the characteristic of the user
1588.88,3.679,on the computer side
1590.64,3.84,a variety of technology has been
1592.559,3.36,developed for supporting interaction
1594.48,3.439,with human
1595.919,4.401,input and output device connect the
1597.919,4.961,human and the machine
1600.32,4.64,so this use in the number of techniques
1602.88,4.08,for organization dialogue
1604.96,4.959,so these techniques are used in turns to
1606.96,5.68,implement larger design elements such as
1609.919,4.481,the metaport of the interface
1612.64,4.32,so getting deeper into the machine
1614.4,3.92,substrata supporting the dialogue the
1616.96,3.599,dialogue
1618.32,3.76,may make extensive use of computer
1620.559,3.441,graphics techniques
1622.08,4.8,complex dialogues lead into a
1624.0,5.84,consideration of the system architecture
1626.88,5.919,and necessary to support such feature
1629.84,5.439,as interconnectable application program
1632.799,5.36,we doing a real-time response network
1635.279,5.52,communication multi-user and cooperative
1638.159,6.0,interface and multi-tasking of a
1640.799,3.36,dialogue objects
1644.32,4.4,finally there is the process of
1645.919,4.88,development which incomplete design
1648.72,4.0,for human computer dialogue techniques
1650.799,4.24,and tools for implementing the
1652.72,6.24,techniques for evaluating them and the
1655.039,5.681,number of classic design for the study
1658.96,4.0,so again the question is what is human
1660.72,4.8,computer interaction so the answer is
1662.96,4.079,hci is the study and the practice of
1665.52,4.24,usability
1667.039,6.161,hci is the study of how people use
1669.76,5.76,computer system to perform a certain
1673.2,2.32,task
1675.84,4.959,okay so this uh
1678.159,4.24,hci is about the importance of human
1680.799,3.041,computer
1682.399,3.681,interaction
1683.84,5.12,in the technology which increased
1686.08,6.0,tremendously so the goal of hcis to
1688.96,6.079,improve the interaction between the user
1692.08,5.68,and the computer by making computer more
1695.039,4.0,user friendly and receptive to the user
1697.76,4.48,needs
1699.039,6.24,hci is concerned with the methodologies
1702.24,5.36,and processes for designing interface
1705.279,5.12,and the methods of implementing
1707.6,5.36,interfaces developing new interface and
1710.399,5.041,interaction techniques a long-term goal
1712.96,4.24,of hcis to design which minimize the
1715.44,4.4,barrier between the human cognitive
1717.2,4.88,models of what they want to accomplish
1719.84,5.6,and the computer understanding of the
1722.08,7.079,user tests okay so that's it for today
1725.44,3.719,and thank you
