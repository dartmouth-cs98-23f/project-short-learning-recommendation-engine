3.429,5.711,"This paper presents a synthesis of COMPUTATIONAL
RATIONALITY as a theory of human-computer"
9.14,1.199,interaction.
10.339,5.531,"Our point of departure is the observation
that interactive behavior is highly adaptive."
15.87,6.79,"That is, the way we act and think emerges,
SOMEHOW, as a function of our beliefs, goals,"
22.66,2.84,"capabilities, and the design."
25.5,5.67,"Understanding this emergence is the primary
goal of this theory."
31.17,3.689,"Computational rationality builds on advances
in machine learning, where, among others,"
34.859,6.551,"reinforcement learning has shown tremendous
success in solving complex interactive tasks."
41.41,3.86,"In reinforcement learning, an agent tries
to learn a sequence of actions that maximizes"
45.27,1.48,its rewards.
46.75,6.07,"This is very similar to HCI where users' goals
are often distal and the world subject to"
52.82,2.66,uncertainty and partial observability.
55.48,8.53,"However, AI research is not aligned with HCI's
goal of explaining HUMAN adaptation."
64.01,8.35,"During the recent years, there has been increasing
interest in exploiting RL to model HCI tasks."
72.36,4.55,"Here you see an RL agent from last year's
CHI."
76.91,5.8,"It moves its eyes and fingers to type a given
sentence with a given UI design."
82.71,3.99,"The model demonstrates very human-like behavior
in how it monitors."
86.7,1.151,typing errors and reacts to them.
87.851,8.479,"The benefit of RL for HCI is that we can change
the design and a new behavior emerges."
96.33,5.17,"Here, autocorrection was turned on and the
agent learned to type in faster and a more"
101.5,4.409,relaxed way relying on the autocorrection.
105.909,4.551,"Remarkably, and in a stark contrast to the
now-popular supervised learning paradigm,"
110.46,7.32,"in RL, no human data is required for training
agents."
117.78,5.7,"In the wake of increasing interest in the
field of HCI, we have to ask what IS computational"
123.48,1.249,rationality for HCI?
124.729,7.43,"That is, what are its core theoretical commitments,
modeling ideas, and what is the scope of tasks"
132.159,3.31,that we can model with it?
135.469,5.041,"Computational rationality originates from
the theory of reinforcement learning, but"
140.51,5.17,"in applications in HCI it takes ideas from
classical cognitive architecture models like"
145.68,1.529,EPIC and GOMS.
147.209,5.53,"In particular, it assumes that the agent can
only access its internal environment, or cognition."
152.739,6.01,"To model that environment, we can take ideas
from cognitive architectures, among others."
158.749,7.24,"We then use RL solvers to approximate boundedly
optimal policies, which generates predictions"
165.989,1.62,of human adaption.
167.609,5.96,"To sum up, the theory assumes that human-like
adaptive behavior emerges if the the relevant"
173.569,7.0,"internal and external bounds are correctly
specified."
180.569,4.73,"Let's compare this more closely with the familiar
cognitive architectures paradigm."
185.299,5.77,"First, while cognitive architecture models
model cognition as an information processor,"
191.069,4.52,"in computational rationality the key purpose
of cognition is to pick actions that are beneficial"
195.589,1.05,for it.
196.639,6.8,"While in cognitive architecture models a researcher
manually specifies a rule set, in computational"
203.439,7.3,"rationality a policy is obtained via optimization,
for example via reinforcement learning."
210.739,5.51,"Both approaches share the idea that behavior
is limited by cognition."
216.249,5.57,"However, in cognitive architecture models
a theory is expressed by a program, or a rule"
221.819,5.89,"set, while in computational rationality we
use decision-theoretic formalisms, for example"
227.709,5.721,"so-called POMDP - or partially observable
Markov decision process."
233.43,3.75,The theory makes four key commitments.
237.18,5.979,"The first is that the user faces a decision
problem that is stochastic and sequential;"
243.159,4.871,"in other words, it must pick an action that
maximizes its future rewards, however this"
248.03,6.299,"is done under partial observability of the
world that is stochastic."
254.329,5.921,"Second, it does not have access to the hard,
external reality, but only to its own cognitive"
260.25,1.0,states.
261.25,4.9,"Third, these states are limited by the bounds
of human cognition."
266.15,12.31,"Fourth, the agent's behavior, over time, approximates
a policy optimized within those bounds."
278.46,6.91,"If you are familiar with RL from the machine
learning side, the main difference is the"
285.37,4.18,internal environment.
289.55,5.869,"Illustrating this further, in standard RL,
the agent's policy is constrained by the external"
295.419,1.0,environment.
296.419,7.141,"We use RL to find the policy that maximizes
the agent's subjective payoff."
303.56,4.759,"By contrast, in computational rationality,
we are also bounded by the agent's internal"
308.319,1.201,environment.
309.52,7.81,"The emergent behaviors can be very different
between these two approaches."
317.33,2.309,How are such models created?
319.639,5.27,"We start modeling by creating a simulated
environment that contains the user agent in"
324.909,4.41,"its environment, including the design; for
example, the eyes and fingers of a typist"
329.319,4.111,operating on a simulated touchscreen interface.
333.43,3.81,"Inputs and outputs to that system are processed
by the internal environment, for example our"
337.24,8.26,"motor and perceptual systems, which are then
made available as states for the agent."
345.5,4.8,"We further need to specify a reward function,
for example ""maximize speed while minimizing"
350.3,3.589,"errors""."
353.889,3.761,"After this, we ask a RL solver to learn a
policy."
357.65,5.329,"After training we can simulate the learned
policy and compute different dependent variables"
362.979,2.641,that we're interested in.
365.62,5.74,"For example, in the typing model, we can compute
trajectories, heatmaps, and summary statistics."
371.36,6.77,"In that particular paper, the results were
remarkably close to human data."
378.13,5.16,"In a stark contrast to AI research, the goal
here is note to learn agents that are ""superior"
383.29,6.589,"to humans but to predict their behavior, including
their imperfections, like the errors they"
389.879,1.57,make.
391.449,3.391,But how far are with this type of modeling?
394.84,5.349,"The paper reviews every paper published on
the topic so far, 15 altogether."
400.189,5.341,"They can be divided into six interactive tasks
ranging from typing to driving and decision-making."
405.53,8.669,"The paper also talks about an emerging opportunity
to apply these models to explain human behavior."
414.199,5.96,"Thanks to the fact that they have fewer number
of free parameters, they can be fit to realistic"
420.159,2.56,"human data much better than cognitive architecture
models."
422.719,4.961,"This is done via so-called likelihood free
inference, where we try to find a combination"
427.68,5.259,"of model parameters that produces as much
as human-like data as possible."
432.939,3.26,See the paper for examples.
436.199,3.65,"Another emerging opportunity concerns design
and adaptive UIs."
439.849,4.581,"Here, we can use computational rationality
to predict how users MIGHT adapt to changes"
444.43,4.16,caused by a design or an intervention.
448.59,1.639,See the paper for examples.
450.229,6.821,"To summarize, HCI has a distinct interest
toward computational rationality."
457.05,4.5,"While AI research studies it as a general
theory of intelligence, and cognitive science"
461.55,4.769,"as a theory of human intelligence, in HCI
we are interested in its potential to inform"
466.319,3.081,the design of better UIs.
469.4,4.94,"However, to make the approach more broadly
accessible and relevant, using Ben Shneiderman's"
474.34,5.74,"term, we need to expand it from micro-HCI
and macro-HCI."
480.08,4.19,"In order to touch topics like computed-mediated
communication, interactive AI, and ubiquitous"
484.27,4.53,"computing, several outstanding theoretical
challenges remain, such as how to model human"
488.8,4.369,"motivation, learning, situations, or social
interactions."
493.169,0.891,Thank you for your attention.
