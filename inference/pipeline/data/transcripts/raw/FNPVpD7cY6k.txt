6.399,4.401,hci
7.279,6.641,lesson 12 types of user interfaces
10.8,6.239,so this is the 12th of the series of
13.92,6.16,video lectures for hci
17.039,6.16,introduction the user interface
20.08,4.24,has two main components the presentation
23.199,3.84,language
24.32,4.719,but is the computer-to-human part of the
27.039,4.64,transaction
29.039,3.761,and an action language which
31.679,5.04,characterizes
32.8,7.279,the human to computer portion together
36.719,8.16,both concepts cover the form and content
40.079,8.16,to the term user interface
44.879,6.32,the natural language interfaces
48.239,3.681,natural language interfaces are perhaps
51.199,4.481,the dream
51.92,6.639,and idea of experienced users
55.68,5.44,because they permit users to interact
58.559,6.96,with the computer in their everyday
61.12,7.84,or natural language no special skills
65.519,5.521,are required of the user who interfaces
68.96,4.96,with the computer using natural
71.04,3.92,language this is the display depicted in
73.92,3.199,the figure
74.96,3.6,so that's below lists three natural
77.119,4.801,language questions
78.56,4.8,from three different applications notice
81.92,3.839,that the interaction
83.36,4.72,with each seems very easy for instance
85.759,5.601,the first sentence seems straightforward
88.08,6.8,at least all the salespeople who met
91.36,4.24,their quotas this month so the subtilt
94.88,2.4,is off
95.6,3.839,and irregularities residing in the
97.28,4.799,ambiguities of english produce
99.439,4.72,an extremely extracting and complex
102.079,4.4,programming problem
104.159,4.32,attempts at natural language interfacing
106.479,3.92,for particular application in which
108.479,3.121,any other type of interfaces is
110.399,3.76,invisible
111.6,4.64,say in the case of a user who is
114.159,6.0,disabled
116.24,7.6,are meeting with some success however
120.159,5.32,these interfaces are typically expensive
123.84,3.76,implementation problems and
125.479,3.721,extraordinary demand on computing
127.6,3.92,resources
129.2,5.36,have so far kept natural language
131.52,5.68,interfaces to a minimum
134.56,3.84,the demand exists though and many
137.2,4.24,programmers
138.4,6.72,and researchers are working diligently
141.44,6.96,on such interfaces it is a growth
145.12,6.64,area and there therefore
148.4,6.479,merits continued monitoring
151.76,4.24,some websites such as ask.com use a
154.879,3.921,natural language for
156.0,5.12,users to enter their search query when
158.8,4.159,the query is entered as.com responds
161.12,4.16,with a list of responses
162.959,4.161,that matches the question entered by the
165.28,6.56,user
167.12,4.72,so question and answer interface
171.92,4.24,so actually google the google search
174.8,2.96,engine also
176.16,3.92,some sort of make use of natural
177.76,4.32,language
180.08,3.68,so here are even some examples of
182.08,5.2,natural language
183.76,6.24,so here we can see here that
187.28,3.679,the user just typed change the ace of id
190.0,4.239,3 to
190.959,6.721,34 which is very straightforward
194.239,8.241,so this will change the id the age
197.68,7.04,of this record with a 93 to 34.
202.48,3.44,so unlike if you use the real select
204.72,3.84,statement we're
205.92,5.039,going to use in you're going to follow a
208.56,5.2,particular syntax like update
210.959,4.0,a uh update whatever the name of the
213.76,4.72,stabilized and set
214.959,7.2,h equals 34 where id equals three that's
218.48,4.88,sql so what is natural language if we're
222.159,4.16,going to look at this
223.36,5.04,at a glance natural language is actually
226.319,4.721,a combination of computer science
228.4,3.04,and linguistics so we have to combine
231.04,3.279,them
231.44,4.32,to arrive at our natural language
234.319,4.521,processes
235.76,6.08,and of course it requires ai and machine
238.84,3.0,learning
243.28,3.92,then we have the question and answer
244.64,3.599,interfaces in a question and answer
247.2,3.599,interface
248.239,3.2,the computer displays a question to the
250.799,3.921,user
251.439,4.08,on the display to interact the user
254.72,3.28,enters an
255.519,3.601,answer maybe by a keyboard stroke or a
258.0,4.079,mouse click
259.12,3.76,and the computer then acts on that input
262.079,4.321,information
262.88,6.08,in a pre programmed manner typically by
266.4,5.2,moving to the next question
268.96,4.799,wizards used to install software are a
271.6,3.599,common example of a question and answer
273.759,3.761,interface
275.199,4.081,the user responds to the questions about
277.52,3.44,the installation process such as where
279.28,4.08,to install the software or
280.96,3.84,features another common example is the
283.36,3.44,use of the office assistant with
284.8,3.839,microsoft products
286.8,3.28,when the user needs help the office
288.639,3.201,assistant
290.08,3.52,asks questions and responds to the
291.84,3.76,answer with additional
293.6,3.76,questions designed to narrow the scope
295.6,3.92,of the problem
297.36,4.16,users unfamiliar with particular
299.52,3.04,applications or not knowledgeable about
301.52,3.2,a topic
302.56,4.0,may find question and answer interfaces
304.72,3.68,the most comfortable
306.56,4.72,and quickly gaining confidence through
308.4,4.799,their success
311.28,3.759,so here are examples of question and
313.199,4.161,answer interfaces so
315.039,3.44,cc are you sure you want to cancel the
317.36,2.96,question
318.479,3.041,so that's already the question so yes or
320.32,3.04,no
321.52,3.36,then here we have another key dialogue
323.36,3.6,so the the page
324.88,4.0,stock overflow says are you sure you
326.96,3.679,want to answer your own question
328.88,3.039,if you're responding to answer blah blah
330.639,4.56,blah so
331.919,5.521,we can click ok or maybe cancel
335.199,3.44,and here's another one welcome to
337.44,4.319,bittrex environment
338.639,3.84,setup so then you can click next or
341.759,3.681,maybe
342.479,4.0,cancel so these are examples of question
345.44,4.64,and answer
346.479,5.921,interfaces menus
350.08,3.839,a mini interface appropriately borrows
352.4,3.519,its name from the list of
353.919,3.12,dishes that can be selected in a
355.919,4.161,restaurant
357.039,4.801,similarly a menu interface provides the
360.08,4.559,user with an on-screen list
361.84,5.52,of available selections in responding to
364.639,4.4,the menu a user is limited to the
367.36,3.76,options displayed
369.039,3.6,the user need to know the system but
371.12,3.44,does not just need
372.639,3.201,to know what tasks should be
374.56,3.359,accomplished
375.84,4.24,for example with a typical word
377.919,5.441,processing menu users can choose
380.08,6.399,from the edit copy or print options
383.36,5.279,to utilize the menu best however
386.479,3.681,users must know which tasks they decide
388.639,3.361,to perform
390.16,3.36,menus are not hardware dependent
392.0,5.12,variations abound
393.52,6.799,and menus can be set up to use keyboard
397.12,5.12,entry light pen or mouse selections can
400.319,4.481,be identified with the number
402.24,4.239,letter or keyword or users can click on
404.8,4.239,the selection with the mouse
406.479,3.521,consistency is important in designing a
409.039,4.641,menu
410.0,6.0,interface so here is an example of an
413.68,5.76,application using a menu interface
416.0,5.039,so this is actually devc so these are
419.44,5.44,menu so we have here the main menu and
421.039,3.841,we have created the secondary options
425.199,6.081,so menu guidelines
428.24,6.32,now so to the side menu
431.28,5.6,so the main menu bar is always displayed
434.56,4.56,so that should be the first guideline
436.88,5.36,the main menu uses single words
439.12,5.28,for menu items so main menu options
442.24,3.76,always display secondary pull down menu
444.4,3.919,so if you're going to look at this
446.0,4.639,this is our main menu and you notice
448.319,7.521,that it is only using single word
450.639,5.201,and these are now our secondary options
456.8,5.04,then the third one the main menu should
459.759,6.321,have secondary options group
461.84,4.24,into similar sets of features
466.8,3.04,so again this is our secondary menu and
469.36,3.679,notice
469.84,3.199,it is also grouped
474.08,4.799,in the features so this is for opening
476.319,4.88,and saving is for closing the project
478.879,4.72,this is for import and export so it is
481.199,2.4,grouped
484.879,3.681,the drop down menus that display when
487.44,4.8,main menu
488.56,6.4,items click open consist of one or
492.24,3.359,consists of more than one word so if
494.96,3.679,you're going to
495.599,3.04,going back at this so
498.72,3.84,some here are more than one word so
500.8,4.239,print set up
502.56,3.6,so we have here close project save
505.039,4.88,project as save
506.16,5.599,as so this is the example sub menu so
509.919,4.56,unlike the main menu which should be
511.759,6.241,single word the secondary one can be
514.479,3.521,more than one word
519.12,4.399,then this secondary options perform
521.12,5.2,actions or display additional menu
523.519,3.201,items so if you're going to look at this
526.32,2.56,so
526.72,3.84,if you click on this that's why we have
528.88,3.76,your arrow here that means if you click
530.56,5.52,on this it will display another
532.64,5.52,set up new or if you click on open
536.08,3.04,then this most probably will open a
538.16,4.88,dialog
539.12,6.48,open dialog box so it will be performing
543.04,5.44,an action or it will be opening another
545.6,4.64,menu just like in this case in new and
548.48,4.56,so here so these are indicators that it
550.24,4.96,will open another menu
553.04,4.32,and then number six menu items in grey
555.2,4.88,are unavailable for the current
557.36,4.64,activity so if you notice there we have
560.08,5.84,here options that are greyed
562.0,7.519,so that means these are unavailable
565.92,7.52,so these are some of the menu guidelines
569.519,6.88,so here's another example bennu so again
573.44,4.48,single word then here we have read our
576.399,3.921,drop down
577.92,3.76,then this will open another menu because
580.32,4.24,of this arrow here
581.68,4.159,and the words can be consisting of more
584.56,4.48,than one word
585.839,6.721,one word or more and the grade
589.04,3.52,is actually disabled
594.959,3.681,form field interfaces or input output
597.36,3.68,forms
598.64,4.96,form fill interfaces consist of
601.04,5.28,on-screen forms or web-based forms
603.6,4.16,displaying field containing data items
606.32,5.12,or parameters
607.76,7.199,that need to be communicated to the user
611.44,7.04,the form often is approximately of
614.959,4.641,a paper form already familiar to the
618.48,3.359,user
619.6,4.0,this interface technique is also known
621.839,5.68,as a form based method and
623.6,6.16,input output forms forms for display
627.519,4.161,screens are set up to show
629.76,3.28,what information should be input and
631.68,4.08,where
633.04,4.96,blank fields requiring information can
635.76,3.759,be highlighted with inverse or flashing
638.0,4.079,characters
639.519,3.201,the cursor is moved by the user from
642.079,3.521,field
642.72,4.72,to field by a single stroke of an arrow
645.6,5.28,key for instance
647.44,6.959,this arrangement allows movement
650.88,6.959,one field backward or one field forward
654.399,6.161,by clicking the appropriate arrow key
657.839,4.481,it provides the user good control over
660.56,4.24,data entry
662.32,3.519,web-based forms affords the opportunity
664.8,4.56,to include
665.839,5.12,hyperlinks to examples of correctly
669.36,4.8,filled out forms
670.959,6.32,or to further help and
674.16,5.919,examples so here's an example the form
677.279,2.8,field interface
680.24,5.599,so where we can sign up we have your
681.839,4.0,text boxes and we appear drop down
687.36,3.12,then you have your button
690.72,3.04,here's another example of a form fill
692.56,3.839,interface
693.76,4.96,so we have here the uh the labels we
696.399,2.321,have the
698.8,3.599,the text boxes we have drop down combo
701.6,4.08,boxes
702.399,3.281,and again we have here a button
707.6,4.56,so form input for this place can be
710.16,3.04,simplified by supplying default values
712.16,3.52,for fields
713.2,3.04,and then allowing users to modify
715.68,3.44,default
716.24,4.96,information if necessary for example a
719.12,2.719,database management system designed to
721.2,2.8,show
721.839,3.521,a form for inputting checks may supply
724.0,3.839,the next sequential check
725.36,4.159,number as a default when a new check
727.839,4.24,form is exhibited
729.519,3.44,if checks are missing the user changes
732.079,4.0,the check
732.959,5.44,number to reflect the actual check being
736.079,5.121,input
738.399,5.201,input for display screen fields can be
741.2,2.96,alphanumerically restricted so that for
743.6,3.6,example
744.16,5.919,users can enter only numbers in field
747.2,5.68,requesting a social security number
750.079,5.041,or they can input only letters where a
752.88,4.959,person's name is required
755.12,3.92,if numbers are in our input where only
757.839,3.12,letters are allowed
759.04,3.12,the computer may alert the user via
760.959,4.081,audio output
762.16,4.64,that will that the field was filled out
765.04,4.16,incorrectly
766.8,4.08,the chief advantage of the input output
769.2,3.92,form interface is that
770.88,5.199,the printed version of the filled in
773.12,5.36,form provides excellent documentation
776.079,4.161,it shows field labels as well as the
778.48,3.84,contacts for entries
780.24,3.52,in addition web forms can form
782.32,3.6,incomplete forms
783.76,4.0,to the user with an explanation of what
785.92,3.359,data must be entered to complete the
787.76,3.92,transaction
789.279,3.521,often fields with missing data are
791.68,4.399,marked with
792.8,6.24,red asterisks web-based documents
796.079,4.56,can be sent directly to billing if a
799.04,3.76,transaction is involved
800.639,5.521,or they can go directly to a consumer
802.8,5.92,database if a survey is being submitted
806.16,4.56,web-based forms push the responsibility
808.72,4.0,for accuracy to the user
810.72,5.04,and make the form available for
812.72,6.88,completion and submission on a 24 hour
815.76,5.84,seven days a week worldwide basis
819.6,3.919,there are a few disadvantages to input
821.6,3.039,output forms the main drawback is that
823.519,2.56,the users
824.639,3.041,experience with the system or
826.079,4.0,application will become impatient with
827.68,6.88,the input output forms and may want
830.079,6.081,more efficient ways to enter data
834.56,3.12,then we also have the command language
836.16,3.52,interfaces
837.68,4.48,a command language interface allows the
839.68,3.76,user to control the application with a
842.16,4.64,series of k strokes
843.44,6.72,commands phrases or sum sequence
846.8,5.599,of these three methods it is a popular
850.16,5.28,interface that is more refined
852.399,5.281,than those previously discussed the
855.44,4.88,command language has no inherent
857.68,4.32,meaning for the user and the fact makes
860.32,3.12,it dissimilar to the other interfaces
862.0,3.12,discussed so far
863.44,3.839,command languages manipulate the
865.12,3.719,computer as a tool by
867.279,3.36,allowing the user to control the
868.839,3.481,dialogue
870.639,3.521,command language the command language
872.32,4.56,affords the user
874.16,4.16,more flexibility and control when the
876.88,3.84,user employs command
878.32,4.16,language the command is executed by the
880.72,3.6,system immediately
882.48,4.719,then the user may proceed to give it
884.32,4.879,another command
887.199,3.44,command languages require memorization
889.199,4.401,of syntax rules
890.639,4.88,that may prove to be obstacles for
893.6,4.479,experienced users
895.519,3.68,experienced users tend to prefer command
898.079,2.961,languages
899.199,4.64,possibly because of their faster
901.04,4.479,completion time
903.839,3.281,so here's an example of a command
905.519,5.32,language interface
907.12,7.76,we type cmd in microsoft windows
910.839,7.721,so here we can type here now our
914.88,5.199,command then we have the graphical user
918.56,2.16,interface i know you're familiar with
920.079,2.32,this
920.72,3.84,so the ketographic graphical user
922.399,4.641,interface or gui
924.56,4.24,is the constant feedback on tasks and
927.04,2.64,accomplishment that they provide to
928.8,3.52,users
929.68,3.599,continuous feedback on the manipulated
932.32,5.28,object
933.279,6.24,means that changes or reversals
937.6,3.679,in the operations can be made quickly
939.519,4.481,without incurring error
941.279,3.92,messages the concept of feedback for
944.0,3.199,users is discussed
945.199,4.241,thoroughly in a later section or later
947.199,4.56,later video
949.44,5.12,the creation of guise poses a challenge
951.759,5.361,because an appropriate modal reality
954.56,5.199,or an acceptable conceptual model of the
957.12,5.36,representation must be invented
959.759,3.52,designing guise for use on internet's
962.48,3.599,extranets
963.279,5.601,and more pressingly on the web requires
966.079,5.601,even more careful planning
968.88,4.959,by and large the users of websites are
971.68,6.32,unknown to the developer
973.839,6.24,so a design must be clear-cut
978.0,4.639,the choice of icons language and
980.079,4.961,hyperlinks becomes an entire set
982.639,4.401,of decisions and assumptions about what
985.04,5.039,kinds of users
987.04,5.68,the website is hoping to attract
990.079,3.521,the designer must also adhere to the
992.72,3.919,conventions
993.6,3.44,that users now expect to encounter on
996.639,2.801,web
997.04,2.4,sites
1000.079,3.521,so here's an example of a graphical user
1002.16,4.0,interface
1003.6,3.12,so this is actually powerpoint so we
1006.16,5.679,have
1006.72,5.119,menus we have icons
1012.8,3.599,we can have also the pointer
1018.16,3.76,and of course you have the windows
1020.19,3.49,[Music]
1021.92,3.999,so here's another example this is a
1023.68,6.96,browser so we have icons
1025.919,4.721,we have we have here menus here
1034.559,4.961,and then these are now touch screens so
1037.52,2.88,this is our other interfaces so we have
1039.52,4.0,the touch screen
1040.4,3.12,user interface
1043.839,3.12,so the text screens or touch and still
1045.919,3.841,displays
1046.959,4.72,allows a user to use a finger to
1049.76,3.84,activate the display
1051.679,4.561,that sensitive displays are useful in
1053.6,5.52,public information displays such as maps
1056.24,6.0,of cities and their sites posted in
1059.12,5.2,hotel lobbies or car rental facilities
1062.24,3.04,they can also be used to explain
1064.32,3.52,dioramas
1065.28,3.36,in museums and to locate dumping
1067.84,4.079,facilities
1068.64,6.32,in state parks touch sensitive displays
1071.919,4.801,require no special expertise from users
1074.96,4.56,and the screen is self-contained
1076.72,7.36,requiring no special input device
1079.52,4.56,that might be broken or stolen
1085.44,2.64,stylus
1088.88,3.28,the stylus is a small pointed stick that
1091.2,2.719,resembles a pen
1092.16,4.16,it's becoming popular because of the new
1093.919,5.12,handwriting recognition software
1096.32,4.08,for personal digital assistants and
1099.039,3.841,mobile phones
1100.4,3.12,pumps combination mobile phones and pdas
1102.88,3.84,and packet
1103.52,5.12,pcs devices have been a success because
1106.72,4.72,they have
1108.64,4.88,they have because they have are useful
1111.44,5.04,and easy to use
1113.52,2.96,so i don't know how
1116.64,3.36,i think there's something wrong
1118.16,3.68,additionally they are so but
1120.0,3.919,we know that they are useful and easy to
1121.84,4.24,use so additionally they are
1123.919,3.441,portable and sell for a comparatively
1126.08,3.28,low price
1127.36,3.92,there has been an explosion of fun and
1129.36,3.28,useful applications written for these
1131.28,2.88,mobile devices
1132.64,3.84,including popular programs for
1134.16,5.44,restaurant reviews such as sagats
1136.48,5.68,and for popular games such as sudoku
1139.6,3.6,data entry is also facilitated without
1142.16,3.44,ducking
1143.2,5.359,cradle so that you can synchronize data
1145.6,2.959,with your pc
1148.799,3.041,voice recognition
1152.799,3.921,so with voice recognition the user
1154.559,4.48,speaks to the computer
1156.72,3.44,and the system is able to recognize an
1159.039,4.0,individual bulk
1160.16,3.84,vocal signals convert them and store the
1163.039,3.52,input
1164.0,3.76,voice recognition inventory systems are
1166.559,4.561,already in operation
1167.76,5.36,and automobiles now feature voice input
1171.12,3.52,systems that respond to a driver voice
1173.12,3.84,commands to navigate
1174.64,4.56,or to change the radio station an
1176.96,3.12,advantage of voice recognition systems
1179.2,3.52,is that they can
1180.08,4.56,speed data entry enormously and free the
1182.72,5.199,user's hands for other tasks
1184.64,6.159,for example driving speech input adds
1187.919,5.041,still another dimension to the pc it is
1190.799,4.961,now possible to add equipment
1192.96,3.44,and software that allows a pc user to
1195.76,3.12,speak
1196.4,3.44,commands such as open file or save file
1198.88,3.36,to avoid
1199.84,3.839,using the keyboard or mouse users with
1202.24,3.679,limited mobility
1203.679,5.201,or in paid site can benefit from voice
1205.919,6.081,recognition systems
1208.88,5.12,so how do we evaluate user interfaces so
1212.0,5.76,we could evaluate the user interfaces by
1214.0,6.159,the necessary training period for users
1217.76,4.399,and it should be acceptable-ish
1220.159,3.841,acceptably short
1222.159,3.921,then in earlier training users should be
1224.0,2.799,able to enter commands without thinking
1226.08,2.88,about them
1226.799,3.12,or without referring to a help hindu or
1228.96,2.88,manual
1229.919,4.561,keeping interface consistent throughout
1231.84,5.04,the application can help in this regard
1234.48,3.12,the interface should be seamless so that
1236.88,3.6,errors
1237.6,6.16,are few and those that do occur are not
1240.48,5.6,occurring because of poor design
1243.76,3.44,the time that users and the system need
1246.08,4.719,to bounce back
1247.2,5.28,from error should be short infrequent
1250.799,4.88,users should be able to
1252.48,5.679,relearn the system quickly
1255.679,4.0,so that's all for this video so this is
1258.159,3.041,our these are the different user
1259.679,3.041,interfaces
1261.2,4.0,now these are just actually some of
1262.72,15.12,these interfaces that we're using today
1265.2,12.64,thank you very much
1282.72,2.079,you
