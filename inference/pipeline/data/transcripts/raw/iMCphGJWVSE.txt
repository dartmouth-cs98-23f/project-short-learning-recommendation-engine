0.62,2.2,"- Hey, if you scroll down slightly further"
2.82,2.67,there is a picture of me(laughs)
5.49,2.882,"- [Man] Use that as the
beginning of this episode please."
8.372,2.583,(upbeat music)
21.799,1.541,Welcome back to coding with Qiskit.
23.34,1.48,"I'm your host, Jin."
24.82,1.38,"If you're new to the series,"
26.2,2.42,"we cover topics in quantum
algorithms each week."
28.62,1.65,So be sure to like and subscribe.
31.14,1.16,Today we are gonna be learning
32.3,1.28,how to install a Qiskit
33.58,1.741,and use a very specific Circuit Library
35.321,2.469,"in order to build our
first quantum algorithm."
37.79,1.83,In order to access this library
39.62,2.33,"we're gonna have to install
a Qiskit locally first."
41.95,2.61,"So let's go through really
quickly how to do this."
44.56,2.22,"So Qiskit is an open source SDK,"
46.78,3.13,"use for programming quantum
computers using Python."
49.91,2.35,"And don't worry if your Python
skills aren't there yet."
52.26,2.04,We'll work through things slowly.
54.3,1.43,So the first thing I'm gonna do
55.73,2.7,is navigate to Qiskit.org
58.43,1.1,this will tell me exactly
59.53,2.42,how to install Qiskit on my machine.
61.95,3.38,"And there is generally two
options for running Qiskit,"
65.33,3.09,"you can either run it on
IBM's hosted jupyter notebooks"
68.42,1.98,or you can install it locally.
70.4,1.35,And the first thing I wanna do
71.75,2.81,is if I don't have Python installed yet
74.56,1.65,is to just install Anaconda
76.21,2.36,"and this will install
all the things I need"
78.57,2.7,"for Python, click download"
82.61,1.48,"I have a Mac,"
84.09,5.0,"so I'll just do the 64 bit
graphical installer and download."
89.32,1.84,"And like always, if you have a windows"
91.16,2.843,"or Linux just choose the
appropriate downloader."
94.95,2.78,"Okay, so now that Anaconda has downloaded"
97.73,1.064,I'll just open this up.
98.794,2.417,(soft music)
102.44,1.57,And I'll install.
104.01,2.417,(soft music)
114.56,1.06,So what I'm gonna do first
115.62,1.99,is set up my Python environment
117.61,1.4,which just is a good way
119.01,2.33,for me to organize my Python packages
121.34,1.64,so that I have all the correct versions
122.98,2.133,of all the packages in one place.
126.06,4.83,So what I'll do is Conda create dash
130.89,2.98,and name of my environment
133.87,4.98,which will be coding with Qiskit or cwq.
138.85,2.85,I'll set my Python version equal to three
141.7,3.183,and the Anaconda distribution.
149.32,4.11,"Okay, and I'm just gonna
watch this little thing spin."
153.43,0.93,"Okay, now it's done."
154.36,2.67,"Okay, so I'm gonna proceed,"
157.03,0.833,yes.
159.9,2.66,And that thing is gonna spin some more
164.65,1.59,this might take a minute.
166.24,3.26,So now that I have my environment set up
169.5,1.22,I'm gonna enter my environment
170.72,4.4,"by going to Conda activate
the name of my environment"
175.12,1.84,which is coding with Qiskit
178.91,4.18,"and I'm going to now install
Qiskit into my environment."
183.09,1.82,So from the Qiskit.org site
186.26,2.73,"just following these
instructions start locally"
188.99,3.92,"I'm gonna choose the
Qiskit stable installation."
192.91,1.41,I have Mac so I will choose Mac
194.32,3.25,"but it's the same if you
have Linux or windows"
197.57,2.07,just choose the correct distribution
201.42,2.14,and then I'll copy this
203.56,2.15,"and PIP install Qiskit
into my environment."
209.51,1.64,So now I have Qiskit installed
211.15,2.9,"and I'm just gonna open
up a jupyter notebook"
214.05,2.05,so we can get started with our algorithm.
219.46,0.833,Perfect.
221.4,3.26,"So I'm gonna open up a
new Python 3 Notebook"
224.66,2.453,and let's get started with our algorithm.
228.14,1.47,So let's build our first algorithm
229.61,1.63,from the circuits library now
231.24,2.11,in order to do this we need a few parts
233.35,3.65,"some data to input, a circuit
to run the calculation"
237.0,1.3,and then an output.
238.3,2.02,In physics we often talk about signals
240.32,2.78,"and signals represent the
transmission of information."
243.1,1.56,And generally we use basis
244.66,2.1,or units such as frequency or time
246.76,1.58,to represent what kind of information
248.34,1.06,that we're transmitting.
249.4,2.08,"I'm gonna show you a quick
example of an algorithm"
251.48,2.59,"that's already built in
Qiskit Circuit Library"
254.07,1.79,called the Fourier Checking Circuit.
255.86,1.26,A Fourier Checking circuit
257.12,1.25,is an important tool used
258.37,1.83,from the signal processing domain.
260.2,1.163,And as a fundamental circuit used
261.363,1.767,"in many other quantum algorithms,"
263.13,1.79,"for example, Shor's algorithm"
264.92,1.94,which we'll cover in a future episode
266.86,2.59,"these circuits can be run
on a real quantum back-end"
269.45,2.52,"or on one of the high
performance simulators"
271.97,1.78,that are available through Qiskit.
273.75,2.01,"All right, so let's get
started with the algorithm."
275.76,3.689,"So the first thing I'm
gonna do is do my imports."
279.449,3.768,"I'm going to import
qiskit.quantum_info as qi"
285.94,3.75,"and this is going to be
doing the calculation."
289.69,2.57,I'm going to import
293.43,1.72,from the Circuit Library
297.5,1.47,the Fourier Checking Circuit
301.85,2.49,"and I'm going to import my visualizer,"
304.34,5.0,"qiskit.visualization
import plot histogram."
314.84,1.07,Okay.
315.91,2.47,Shift+ Enter to execute that.
318.38,3.31,"So for this, algorithm, I'm
gonna define two functions."
321.69,1.69,"They're just lists,"
323.38,4.0,"f is equal to one minus
one minus one minus one"
328.24,5.0,"and g is equal to one,
one minus one minus one."
336.35,2.22,"So now that we have our
two functions f and g"
338.57,1.77,the Fourier Checking Circuit will tell us
340.34,3.34,how correlated the Fourier transform of g
343.68,1.67,is to our function f.
345.35,2.55,"And it turns out that a
quantum computer can perform"
347.9,2.92,"this calculation much faster
than a classical computer can."
350.82,1.75,So the circuit will output a probability
352.57,1.4,for the zero zero state.
353.97,2.82,"And if the probability
is greater than 0.05"
356.79,2.66,then the Fourier transform our function g
359.45,1.753,is correlated with our function f.
362.08,0.833,Okay.
362.913,2.157,So I'm gonna set up my circuit equals
365.07,3.98,"Fourier checking and I'll
put in my two functions"
369.05,1.47,f is equal to f
370.52,1.823,"and g is equal to g,"
376.415,1.675,circ.draw
378.09,1.25,See what this looks like.
380.54,0.92,Okay.
381.46,3.23,"This is what my quantum circuit
will actually look like."
384.69,1.87,"So let's run this,"
386.56,1.24,zero equals
388.883,2.327,qi.state vector
392.98,3.76,from label zero zero
396.74,2.16,"is going to evolve this,"
398.9,3.847,state vector is equal to zero.evolve.circ
406.0,2.63,"and I'm gonna get my
probabilities back here."
408.63,4.15,probs equals sv.probabilities
422.12,1.43,Okay and then I'm gonna plot
423.55,1.51,what this looks like.
425.06,1.85,And remember I'm only interested
426.91,1.45,in the zero zero probability.
433.096,1.624,"Okay, perfect."
434.72,3.11,"So I get back a histogram
here am only interested"
437.83,1.27,in the zero zero probabilities
439.1,2.13,which I get 0.25
441.23,2.21,"so what this means is
the Fourier transform"
443.44,4.063,"of my g function is
correlated with my f function."
448.73,1.44,So you can try to circ it yourself
450.17,2.09,"and see how the output
changed depending on"
452.26,1.49,your input functions.
453.75,1.52,This is where we'll stop for today.
455.27,2.07,"But hopefully now you
have Qiskit installed"
457.34,1.77,you're familiar with the Circuit Library
459.11,2.7,"and you're able to run your
first quantum algorithm."
461.81,1.3,Make sure to like and subscribe
463.11,1.33,because next time we're gonna be talking
464.44,1.33,about what it actually means
465.77,1.7,to be a slur algorithm
467.47,1.43,and why certain algorithms are better
468.9,2.98,"for quantum computers
versus classical computers."
471.88,1.612,Jin out.
473.492,2.083,(laughs)
477.31,1.02,Can you just have a jump cut
478.33,1.577,where I like tap it away (laughs)
479.907,1.5,- [Man] Absolutely
482.678,2.583,(upbeat music)
