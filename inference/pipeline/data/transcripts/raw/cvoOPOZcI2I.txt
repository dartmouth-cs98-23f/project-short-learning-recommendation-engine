second,duration,transcript
2.399,5.36,hi everyone
4.88,3.44,today i came up with uh data structures
7.759,3.84,session
8.32,4.319,uh session three in this session we can
11.599,3.12,discuss about
12.639,4.4,the graphs graph theory of data
14.719,7.121,structure which is more important
17.039,7.281,even for jobs okay so let me go to
21.84,3.359,next slide yeah so let us see what is
24.32,4.56,graph
25.199,6.48,a graph is a combination of
28.88,3.76,vectors and edges consists of a finite
31.679,4.241,non-empty set
32.64,5.599,of vertices the finite set of
35.92,3.76,edges which connects pair of vertices so
38.239,4.0,suppose in this graph
39.68,3.52,one two three four five six so these
42.239,3.921,circles are
43.2,4.879,vertices and the lines which are
46.16,6.16,connecting uh these circles
48.079,6.0,are called edges so we see here v means
52.32,3.759,vertices one two three four five are the
54.079,5.28,vectors and edges are
56.079,7.601,one one four and 4 2
59.359,7.44,and 2 5 3 5 and 4 5 so these are all
63.68,5.36,edges okay so a graph
66.799,3.121,consists of a finite non empty set of
69.04,3.28,vertices
69.92,5.12,and a finite set of edges which connects
72.32,5.119,pair of vertices
75.04,4.32,okay now let us understand some
77.439,3.68,terminologies like what is multi graph
79.36,4.72,what is directed graph
81.119,5.281,okay multi graph is a graph which
84.08,5.359,consists of a set of vertices and edges
86.4,4.399,and it just may contain multiple edges
89.439,4.0,that is it just
90.799,4.96,containing same pair of vertices or self
93.439,2.32,edges
96.159,4.0,so multi graph it contains multiple it i
99.04,3.759,mean it's one here
100.159,4.64,this can contain multiple edges okay it
102.799,5.761,is containing same pair of vertices
104.799,5.521,or selfies directly
108.56,3.519,so what is directed roughly directed
110.32,4.799,graph is one
112.079,3.68,in which uh each edge is an ordered pair
115.119,4.081,of
115.759,6.72,vertices so if you look at below a graph
119.2,4.16,uh see here from two to one the arrow is
122.479,2.801,towards one
123.36,4.16,so that means this is a directed track
125.28,5.759,here it is showing this edge is showing
127.52,5.68,a direction for the edge okay so from
131.039,4.641,two to one we can go but from one to two
133.2,5.36,here there is no uh direction so that
135.68,6.16,means we we can't go from one to two
138.56,5.6,okay so in directed graph this
141.84,3.6,one ah one two two is not equals to two
144.16,4.799,to one
145.44,5.2,okay because uh we have direction uh
148.959,3.36,towards only one direction suppose in
150.64,4.16,the undirected draft
152.319,3.681,uh this is equal so p1 and v2 both are
154.8,4.24,equal so v 1
156.0,4.72,v 2 or v 2 v 1 both are same
159.04,4.72,but in directed rap it is different
160.72,5.599,because we depends on direction
163.76,3.92,okay let us go through let us see what
166.319,3.441,is undirected of
167.68,4.08,a graph whose definition makes a
169.76,2.64,reference to unordered pairs of vertices
171.76,3.839,that is
172.4,4.24,v1 or v2 so here if you look at the
175.599,4.0,diagram in
176.64,5.12,directed graph so it was showing some
179.599,3.681,arrow symbol here but here in undirected
181.76,4.08,graph there is no arrow symbol
183.28,3.84,or no direction we can check okay so
185.84,3.679,that is called undirection
187.12,4.16,i mean undirected graph so in undirected
189.519,6.561,graph one two four is
191.28,4.8,uh same as four to one okay
197.44,3.36,yeah so what is degree of a vectors so
199.68,3.199,degree of a vector
200.8,3.28,is number of edges which are connecting
202.879,4.08,to uh
204.08,3.519,a number of edges which are connecting a
206.959,2.321,vertex
207.599,3.601,so in case of directed graphs and number
209.28,3.92,of videos are going to a node
211.2,3.92,is known as degree of corresponding node
213.2,3.84,and number which is coming out of a node
215.12,4.88,is known as out degree of
217.04,3.52,corresponding node so degree suppose let
220.0,3.599,us take
220.56,4.8,let us see a is a vertex and va is
223.599,3.28,being connected with two adjust that
225.36,5.04,means degree of a is
226.879,6.161,two okay for b also b is connecting
230.4,3.919,by two edges so that means degree of
233.04,4.88,this
234.319,5.361,undirected vertex b is two
237.92,3.2,so similarly for if you look at the
239.68,4.559,second graph
241.12,4.64,so p ah p has three edges so this one
244.239,4.64,this one and this one that means p
245.76,4.88,degree degree of p is three
248.879,3.36,okay for all other vertices but in
250.64,5.04,directed graph
252.239,7.041,as it shows a direction uh
255.68,5.2,uh as it shows direction so we have two
259.28,3.199,two types of terminologies one is in
260.88,4.64,degree and one is out degree
262.479,3.681,so any edges coming to a particular
265.52,4.239,matrix
266.16,6.24,uh with text is called in degree any uh
269.759,4.88,any edge which is going from current
272.4,5.12,current vertex is called out degree of
274.639,2.881,the current matrix
278.479,4.801,yeah so complete graphs in undirected
281.12,4.639,draft with n vertices and the nc2
283.28,4.72,address is said to be complete
285.759,3.44,the complete graph is under your draft
288.0,5.759,with n vertices and
289.199,8.641,nc to n2c2 edges
293.759,4.081,is said to be complete
302.32,5.12,see this is uh this one edge should
305.919,3.12,should be connected to all other ridges
307.44,4.479,in the graph suppose
309.039,3.761,this this one so this is p e has
311.919,4.161,connection to
312.8,4.56,q or s all three so similarly q also has
316.08,2.88,connection to all three
317.36,8.24,other vertices so that is called
318.96,6.64,complete graph
