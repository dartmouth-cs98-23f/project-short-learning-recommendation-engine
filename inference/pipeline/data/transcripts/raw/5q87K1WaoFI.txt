0.24,4.24,hi i'm hilary mason i'm a computer
2.639,4.001,scientist and today i've been asked to
4.48,4.48,explain machine learning in five levels
6.64,4.56,of increasing complexity machine
8.96,4.719,learning gives us the ability to learn
11.2,4.72,things about the world from large
13.679,4.801,amounts of data that we as human beings
15.92,4.4,can't possibly study or appreciate so
18.48,4.16,machine learning is when we teach
20.32,4.799,computers to learn patterns from looking
22.64,4.799,at examples in data such that they can
25.119,4.0,recognize those patterns and apply them
27.439,4.401,to new things that they haven't seen
29.119,2.721,before
33.68,3.44,hi
34.48,4.96,hi i'm hillary what's your name i'm
37.12,5.439,brynn do you know what machine learning
39.44,5.439,means have you heard that before no so
42.559,4.881,machine learning is a way that we teach
44.879,5.121,computers to learn things about the
47.44,5.439,world by looking at patterns and looking
50.0,4.32,at examples of things so can i show you
52.879,3.84,an example
54.32,6.079,of how a machine might learn something
56.719,4.721,sure so is this a dog or cat it's a dog
60.399,4.08,and
61.44,7.44,it's this one a cat and what makes a dog
64.479,8.241,a dog and a cat a cat well dogs are very
68.88,6.64,playful i think more than cats cats lick
72.72,4.24,themselves more than dogs i think
75.52,2.959,do you think if we look at these
76.96,3.6,pictures
78.479,4.721,do you think maybe we could say well
80.56,4.8,they both have pointy ears but the dogs
83.2,4.559,have a different kind of body and the
85.36,4.64,cats like to stand up a little different
87.759,5.601,do you think that makes sense yeah yeah
90.0,5.28,what about this one a dog
93.36,4.16,a cat
95.28,6.08,i think a cat
97.52,6.48,because it's more skinny and also its
101.36,4.96,legs are like really tall
104.0,4.88,and its ears are a little pointy this
106.32,5.2,one's a jackal and it's actually a kind
108.88,5.12,of dog but you made a good guess that's
111.52,4.4,what machines do too they make guesses
114.0,5.119,is this a cat or a dog
115.92,4.96,none none what is it it's humans and how
119.119,5.201,did you know that it's not a cat or a
120.88,6.239,dog because cats and dogs because they
124.32,4.799,walk on their paws and their ears are
127.119,3.521,like right here not right here and they
129.119,3.521,don't wear watches
130.64,4.4,and so you did something pretty amazing
132.64,4.56,there because we asked the question is
135.04,4.64,it a cat or a dog and you said i
137.2,4.48,disagree with your question it's a human
139.68,4.48,so machine learning is when we teach
141.68,4.639,machines to make guesses about what
144.16,4.48,things are based on looking at a lot of
146.319,4.321,different examples and i build products
148.64,4.16,that use machine learning to learn about
150.64,3.92,the world and make guesses about things
152.8,4.159,in the world when we try to teach
154.56,5.759,machines to recognize things like cats
156.959,4.881,and dogs it takes a lot of examples we
160.319,4.401,have to show them
161.84,5.759,tens of thousands or even millions of
164.72,5.599,examples before they can get even close
167.599,4.161,to as good at it as you are do you have
170.319,4.481,tests in school
171.76,5.28,yeah i have after every unit we have a
174.8,4.719,review and then we have a test are those
177.04,4.24,like the practice problems you do before
179.519,3.601,the test well just like everything
181.28,3.84,that's going to be on the test is on the
183.12,3.68,review which means that in the test
185.12,3.199,you're not seeing any problems that you
186.8,3.359,don't know how to solve
188.319,4.56,as long as you did all your practice
190.159,4.481,right yeah so machines work the same way
192.879,4.08,if you show them a lot of examples and
194.64,4.239,give them practice they'll learn how to
196.959,2.801,guess and then when you give them the
198.879,3.28,test
199.76,4.8,they should be able to do that so we
202.159,5.201,looked at eight pictures and you were
204.56,5.2,able to answer really quickly but what
207.36,4.48,would you do if i gave you 10 million
209.76,4.72,examples would you be able to do that so
211.84,4.64,quickly yeah so one of the differences
214.48,3.92,between people and machines
216.48,3.759,is that people
218.4,3.52,might be a little better at this but
220.239,3.761,can't look at 10 million different
221.92,3.84,things now that we've been talking about
224.0,3.92,machine learning is this something you
225.76,5.44,want to learn how to do um
227.92,4.879,kind of because i kind of want to become
231.2,2.48,a spy
232.799,2.72,and
233.68,3.36,we used to do
235.519,4.161,coding
237.04,4.08,so i may be kind of good
239.68,3.6,and machine learning is a great way to
241.12,4.96,use all those math skills all those
243.28,5.76,coding skills and would be a super cool
246.08,2.96,tool for a spy
250.72,4.159,hello
252.48,5.52,hi are you a student lucy yes i just
254.879,5.121,finished ninth grade congratulations
258.0,4.0,thank you it's very exciting have you
260.0,4.96,ever heard of machine learning before
262.0,5.199,i'm going to assume that it means humans
264.96,5.04,being able to teach
267.199,5.44,machines or robots how to learn
270.0,4.88,themselves that's right when we
272.639,5.12,teach machines to
274.88,5.039,learn from data to build a model from
277.759,4.241,that data or a representation of that
279.919,4.481,and then to make a prediction one of the
282.0,4.479,places we often find machine learning in
284.4,4.32,the real world is in things like
286.479,4.641,recommendation systems so do you have an
288.72,4.479,artist do you really like yeah melanie
291.12,5.04,martinez so i'm gonna look up melanie
293.199,5.28,martinez and it says here if you like
296.16,4.56,melanie martinez one of the other songs
298.479,5.121,you might like is by aura do you know
300.72,7.319,who that is i do not so let's listen to
303.6,4.439,a hint of this song okay
315.759,2.641,all right
316.72,4.16,so why do you think spotify might have
318.4,4.48,recommended that song well i know that
320.88,3.92,in melanie martinez's music she used a
322.88,3.92,lot of the filtered voice to make it
324.8,4.0,sound very deep and low
326.8,3.76,and that song had that and that's
328.8,4.64,actually a really interesting thing to
330.56,5.199,think about because that creepy vibe is
333.44,4.16,something that you can perceive and i
335.759,4.081,can perceive but it's actually really
337.6,4.319,hard to describe to a machine what do
339.84,4.639,you think might go into that pitch of
341.919,5.441,the music if it's really low or if it's
344.479,5.201,super high it could know that what can
347.36,4.399,the machine understand it's a great
349.68,4.799,question the machine can understand
351.759,4.56,whatever we tell it to understand so
354.479,4.16,there might be a person thinking about
356.319,3.44,things like the pitch or the pacing or
358.639,3.441,the tone
359.759,6.241,or sometimes machines can figure out
362.08,4.88,things about music or images or videos
366.0,3.759,that
366.96,4.72,we don't tell it to discover but that it
369.759,4.241,can learn from looking at a lot of
371.68,4.48,different examples why do you think
374.0,3.039,companies might use machine learning i
376.16,3.36,think
377.039,5.44,things like facebook or instagram they
379.52,5.76,probably use it to target ads sometimes
382.479,5.601,the ads you see are really uncanny and i
385.28,5.759,think that's because they're based on so
388.08,5.119,much data they know where you live they
391.039,4.481,know where your device is it's also
393.199,3.681,important to realize that people in
395.52,3.44,aggregate are actually pretty
396.88,4.159,predictable like when we talk to each
398.96,3.519,other we like to talk about the novel
401.039,3.6,things like here we're having this
402.479,4.241,conversation we don't do this every day
404.639,3.361,but we probably still eat breakfast
406.72,2.72,we're gonna eat lunch we're gonna eat
408.0,4.16,dinner you probably are going to the
409.44,5.12,same home you go to most of the time and
412.16,4.08,so they're able to take that data that
414.56,4.479,we already give them and make
416.24,5.359,predictions based on that as to what ads
419.039,5.761,they should show us so you're saying i
421.599,5.44,give them enough data as it is
424.8,4.56,about what i might be talking about or
427.039,3.841,thinking about that they can
429.36,3.2,read my mind
430.88,4.879,but just use the data that i've already
432.56,4.639,given them and it almost seems like
435.759,3.361,that's why yes
437.199,3.521,to do machine learning we use something
439.12,4.079,called algorithms have you heard of
440.72,5.44,algorithms before a
443.199,5.521,set of steps or a process carried out to
446.16,4.24,complete something that's right so do
448.72,3.44,you think that we've been able to teach
450.4,4.16,machines enough so that they can do
452.16,4.56,things that even we can't do
454.56,4.0,and on the opposite side of that do you
456.72,4.479,think there are things that we can do
458.56,4.72,that a machine might never be able to do
461.199,4.241,so there are things that machines are
463.28,4.479,really great at that humans are actually
465.44,5.439,not great at imagine watching every
467.759,5.28,video posted to tick tock every day so
470.879,4.241,we just don't have enough time to do
473.039,4.081,that at the rate at which we can
475.12,4.4,actually watch those videos but a
477.12,4.799,machine can analyze all of them and then
479.52,4.32,make recommendations to us and then
481.919,4.241,thinking about things that
483.84,5.359,machines are bad at and people are good
486.16,5.36,at people are really great with only one
489.199,4.161,or two examples of learning something
491.52,3.44,new and incorporating that into our
493.36,3.92,model of the world to make good
494.96,4.72,decisions whereas machines often need
497.28,5.039,tens of thousands of examples and that's
499.68,4.639,not even getting into things like
502.319,4.641,good judgment because we care about
504.319,4.961,people because we can imagine
506.96,4.56,a future that we want to live in that
509.28,4.559,doesn't exist today and that's something
511.52,3.92,that is still uniquely human machines
513.839,3.521,are great at predicting based on what
515.44,3.92,they've seen in the past but they're not
517.36,3.039,creative they're not going to invent
519.36,2.479,they're not going to
520.399,4.721,you know really change where we're going
521.839,3.281,to go that's up to us
529.68,3.279,i'm sunny
530.88,3.6,and what are you majoring in i study
532.959,4.0,math and computer science
534.48,4.24,so in your studies have you learned
536.959,3.681,about machine learning
538.72,6.0,yeah i have so
540.64,6.319,to me machine learning is essentially
544.72,4.559,exactly what it sounds like it's trying
546.959,4.56,to teach a machine
549.279,4.801,specifics about something
551.519,4.161,by inputting a lot of data points
554.08,3.84,and slowly
555.68,4.32,the machine will
557.92,4.56,build up knowledge about it over time
560.0,3.76,for example my gmail program i assumed
562.48,3.359,that there would be a lot of like
563.76,4.48,machine learning models happening at
565.839,4.401,once right absolutely and that's a great
568.24,4.159,example because you have models that are
570.24,4.64,operating to do things like figure out
572.399,4.641,if a new email is spam or not so what
574.88,4.079,would you think about if you were
577.04,4.4,looking at an email and trying to decide
578.959,4.721,if it went in one category or another
581.44,5.519,i'd probably look at certain keywords
583.68,5.599,maybe if the recipient and sender had
586.959,3.841,exchanged emails before and what
589.279,3.521,generally those
590.8,3.84,fell into in the past so these are
592.8,4.08,things we would call features we go
594.64,4.16,through a process where we do feature
596.88,3.92,engineering where somebody looks at the
598.8,4.64,example and says okay these are the
600.8,4.479,things that i think might allow us to
603.44,4.32,statistically tell the difference from
605.279,4.641,something in one category versus another
607.76,3.84,so for example perhaps you don't speak
609.92,3.599,russian you start getting a lot of email
611.6,3.76,in russian obviously like the features
613.519,3.841,that you just described are features
615.36,4.0,which a person would have had to think
617.36,4.88,about are there features which like the
619.36,5.919,machine itself could learn this is a
622.24,5.68,great question because it really gets to
625.279,4.401,the difference between some of our
627.92,4.08,different tools in our machine learning
629.68,5.52,tool belt in addressing problems like
632.0,5.04,this so if we were to use a
635.2,4.48,supervised learning classic
637.04,4.72,classification approach a person would
639.68,4.64,need to think about those features and
641.76,4.319,creatively come up with them an approach
644.32,3.6,we call the kitchen sink approach which
646.079,4.32,is just try everything you can possibly
647.92,4.96,think of and see what works unsupervised
650.399,5.68,learning where we don't have label data
652.88,5.28,and we're trying to infer some structure
656.079,4.401,out of the data as you're projecting
658.16,4.48,that data into a space and looking for
660.48,4.72,things like clusters and there's a bunch
662.64,4.72,of really fun math about how you do that
665.2,5.52,how you think about distance and by
667.36,5.599,distance i mean that if we have two data
670.72,5.679,points in space how do we decide if
672.959,6.241,they're similar or not and how do
676.399,4.801,the algorithms themselves usually differ
679.2,4.56,between unsupervised and supervised
681.2,5.04,learning supervised learning we have our
683.76,4.24,labels and we're trying to figure out
686.24,4.48,what statistically indicates if
688.0,5.519,something matches one label or another
690.72,4.96,label unsupervised learning we don't
693.519,3.841,necessarily have those labels that's the
695.68,3.44,thing we're trying to discover so
697.36,4.0,reinforcement learning is another
699.12,4.159,technique that we use sometimes you can
701.36,3.12,think about it like a turn in a game and
703.279,3.921,you can play
704.48,4.88,you know millions and millions of trials
707.2,4.639,so that you're able to develop a system
709.36,4.4,that by experimenting with reinforcement
711.839,4.321,learning can eventually learn to play
713.76,4.879,these games pretty successfully deep
716.16,4.96,learning which is essentially using
718.639,5.121,neural networks and very large amounts
721.12,4.32,of data to eventually iterate on a
723.76,4.319,network structure that can make
725.44,7.04,predictions with reinforcement learning
728.079,6.081,versus deep learning it seems to me that
732.48,3.2,reinforcement learning is it sort of
734.16,3.44,like the kitchen sink approach that you
735.68,4.8,were talking about earlier where you're
737.6,6.08,just kind of trying everything it is but
740.48,6.0,it also thrives in environments where
743.68,5.12,you have a decision point a pallet of
746.48,3.28,actions to choose from and it actually
748.8,2.88,comes
749.76,4.48,historically from trying to train a
751.68,4.159,robot to navigate a room if it bonks
754.24,4.0,into this chair it can't go forward
755.839,4.8,anymore and if it falls into that pit
758.24,4.56,you know it's not going to succeed but
760.639,6.481,if it keeps exploring it'll eventually
762.8,6.159,get to the goal oh like roombas yes
767.12,4.159,oh wow i didn't realize it was that deep
768.959,3.921,almost is there a situation which you'd
771.279,4.161,want to use a deep learning algorithm
772.88,4.24,over a reinforcement learning algorithm
775.44,4.24,so typically you would choose deep
777.12,5.279,learning if you have sufficient high
779.68,4.0,quality data hopefully labeled in a
782.399,2.321,useful way
783.68,4.64,if you
784.72,5.919,really are happy not to necessarily
788.32,4.24,understand or be able to interpret what
790.639,4.0,your system is doing or you're willing
792.56,4.88,to invest in another set of work
794.639,4.721,afterwards to understand what the system
797.44,3.92,is doing once you've already trained it
799.36,3.76,and this also comes down to the fact
801.36,4.32,that some things are actually really
803.12,4.959,easy to solve with linear regression or
805.68,4.56,simple statistical approaches and some
808.079,4.161,things are impossible what would be the
810.24,3.92,outcome if you were to choose the quote
812.24,5.12,unquote wrong approach you build a
814.16,4.96,system that could actually be useless so
817.36,4.4,years ago i had a client there was a big
819.12,4.399,telecom company and they had a data
821.76,3.84,scientist who built a deep learning
823.519,4.241,system to predict customer churn
825.6,4.64,actually was very accurate but it wasn't
827.76,4.879,useful because nobody knew why the
830.24,4.88,prediction was what it was so they could
832.639,4.401,say you know sonny you're likely to quit
835.12,3.2,next month but they had no idea what to
837.04,3.039,do about it
838.32,3.519,and so i think there are a bunch of
840.079,3.681,failure modes would that be an example
841.839,4.321,of like linear regression where the
843.76,4.4,regression is accurate but you know for
846.16,3.52,marketing purposes it's like if you
848.16,4.4,don't know why i'm quitting the service
849.68,5.44,then how can we fix this yeah this is
852.56,5.279,actually a good example of a very real
855.12,5.36,world kind of machine learning problem
857.839,4.881,where the solution to this was to build
860.48,4.08,an interpretable system on top of the
862.72,3.52,accurate prediction so not to throw it
864.56,4.399,away but to do a bunch more work to
866.24,4.64,figure out the why how can we improve
868.959,3.521,machine learning algorithms it's
870.88,4.399,actually uh
872.48,4.799,fairly new that we're able to solve all
875.279,3.441,of these problems and start to build
877.279,3.441,these products and apply it in
878.72,4.88,businesses and apply it you know
880.72,6.08,everywhere and so we're still developing
883.6,5.2,good practices and what it means to be a
886.8,3.839,professional in machine learning we're
888.8,4.399,really developing a notion of what good
890.639,2.56,looks like
894.959,5.68,i'm in my first year of a phd in
898.24,4.32,computer science and i'm studying
900.639,3.521,natural language processing and machine
902.56,3.2,learning so would you mind telling me a
904.16,3.44,bit about what you've been working on or
905.76,4.879,interested in lately i've been looking
907.6,6.479,at understanding persuasion and online
910.639,4.32,text and the ways that we might be able
914.079,3.281,to
914.959,4.961,automatically detect the intent behind
917.36,4.64,that persuasion or who it's targeted at
919.92,3.52,and what makes effective persuasive
922.0,3.44,techniques so what are some of the
923.44,3.839,techniques you're applying to look at
925.44,5.12,that debate data something i'm
927.279,4.8,interested in exploring is how well it
930.56,3.279,works to use
932.079,4.481,deep learning and sort of automatically
933.839,4.321,extracted features from this text versus
936.56,3.68,using some of the more traditional
938.16,4.239,techniques that we have things like
940.24,4.8,lexicons or some sort of template
942.399,4.641,matching techniques for extracting
945.04,3.84,features from text that's a question i'm
947.04,3.76,just interested in in general when do we
948.88,3.759,really need deep learning versus when
950.8,3.279,can we use something that's a little bit
952.639,3.12,more interpretable something that's been
954.079,4.0,around for a while do you think there
955.759,4.801,are going to be general principles that
958.079,4.401,guide those decisions because right now
960.56,4.16,it's generally up to the machine
962.48,4.479,learning engineer to decide what tools
964.72,5.44,they want to apply i definitely think
966.959,5.68,there is but i also sort of see it
970.16,4.0,varying a lot based on the use case
972.639,3.521,something that kind of
974.16,3.76,works out of the box and maybe works a
976.16,4.08,little bit more automatically might be
977.92,4.24,better and in other cases you do sort of
980.24,3.92,kind of you want a lot of fine grain
982.16,4.08,control so is that where some of that
984.16,4.0,frustration around the lack of
986.24,3.44,controllability and interpretability
988.16,3.679,comes from yeah if you're building a
989.68,4.079,model that just predicts the next thing
991.839,3.841,based off of everything it's seen from
993.759,4.0,text online then yeah you're really
995.68,4.64,going to be replicating whatever that
997.759,4.88,distribution online is if you train a
1000.32,4.639,model off of language off the internet
1002.639,4.56,it sometimes says uncomfortable things
1004.959,4.641,or inappropriate things and sometimes
1007.199,4.161,really biased things have you ever run
1009.6,4.08,into this yourself and then how do you
1011.36,5.279,think about that problem of
1013.68,4.719,potentially even measuring the bias in a
1016.639,4.56,model that we've trained
1018.399,4.481,yeah it's a really tricky question as
1021.199,3.6,you said these models are trained to
1022.88,3.919,sort of predict the next sequence of
1024.799,3.76,words given a certain sequence of words
1026.799,4.16,so we could start with just sort of
1028.559,4.88,prompts like the woman was versus the
1030.959,5.12,man was and kind of pull out common
1033.439,5.041,words that are sort of more used with
1036.079,4.561,one phrase versus the other so that's
1038.48,4.479,sort of a qualitative way of looking at
1040.64,4.48,it it's not ever kind of a guarantee of
1042.959,3.84,how the model is going to behave in one
1045.12,2.559,particular instance and i think that's
1046.799,2.721,what's
1047.679,3.681,really tricky and that's why i sort of
1049.52,4.08,think it's really good for
1051.36,4.8,creators of systems to just be honest
1053.6,4.16,about this is sort of what we have seen
1056.16,3.44,and so then someone can make their own
1057.76,4.48,judgment about is this going to be too
1059.6,4.64,high risk for sort of my particular use
1062.24,4.16,case i imagine in the last few years
1064.24,4.64,we've seen a lot of changes and
1066.4,5.04,improvements in the capabilities of nlp
1068.88,4.4,systems so is there anything in that
1071.44,3.92,that you're particularly excited about
1073.28,4.48,exploring further i'm
1075.36,3.76,really interested in
1077.76,3.2,sort of the
1079.12,4.559,creative potential that we've started to
1080.96,4.719,see from nlp systems with things like
1083.679,5.921,gpd3 and other really powerful language
1085.679,5.921,models it's really easy to write long
1089.6,4.0,grammatical passages thinking about the
1091.6,3.76,way that we can then harness like the
1093.6,3.68,human ability to actually give meaning
1095.36,3.6,to those words and sort of provide
1097.28,3.68,structure and how we can combine those
1098.96,4.0,things with the kind of like generative
1100.96,3.68,capabilities of these models now is
1102.96,4.56,really interesting yeah i agree
1104.64,4.96,[Music]
1107.52,3.92,so hi claudia it's so great to see you
1109.6,4.8,it's been far too long you know we first
1111.44,5.76,met 10 11 years ago and machine learning
1114.4,6.56,has changed a lot since then tooling
1117.2,6.32,that we now have the capacity and also
1120.96,4.959,an elevation of the problem sets that
1123.52,3.519,we're dealing with and how to frame the
1125.919,2.88,problem
1127.039,4.481,and i'm
1128.799,4.88,almost struggling to figure out whether
1131.52,5.92,it's a blessing or a curse that it has
1133.679,4.721,become as accessible and as democratized
1137.44,3.119,and as
1138.4,4.639,easy to execute and you just build
1140.559,4.401,another new company from scratch but so
1143.039,3.841,what's been kind of your reflection on
1144.96,4.719,that well you're absolutely right that
1146.88,5.039,the attention machine learning gets has
1149.679,4.0,grown dramatically 20 years ago going to
1151.919,3.601,gatherings and telling people what i was
1153.679,3.441,working on and how to seeing the blank
1155.52,3.84,face or the like where's the turn and
1157.12,4.32,walk away like oh no
1159.36,5.28,the accessibility of the tooling like we
1161.44,5.44,can now do in like five lines of code
1164.64,5.12,something that would have taken 500
1166.88,5.28,lines of very mathematical messy gnarly
1169.76,4.72,code even you know five years ago and
1172.16,4.16,it's not an exaggeration and there are
1174.48,3.84,tools that mean that pretty much anyone
1176.32,4.08,can pick this up and start playing with
1178.32,5.359,it and start to build with it and that
1180.4,5.12,is also really exciting in contrast what
1183.679,3.841,i'm struggling with the friend of mine
1185.52,3.44,who asked me to look at some healthcare
1187.52,3.84,data for him
1188.96,4.8,and despite the capabilities that we're
1191.36,5.36,having in all of the kind of bigger
1193.76,4.96,societal problems alongside with
1196.72,4.16,data collection engineering all the
1198.72,4.16,gnarly stuff that is actually not the
1200.88,5.12,machine learning itself
1202.88,4.799,it's the rest of it where certain data
1206.0,4.799,isn't available and to me it's
1207.679,5.841,staggering how difficult it is to get it
1210.799,5.521,off the ground and actually use and
1213.52,4.72,part of the challenge of it is not the
1216.32,3.839,mathematics of building models but the
1218.24,4.0,challenge is making sure that the data
1220.159,3.841,is sufficiently representative
1222.24,3.84,potentially high quality but how
1224.0,5.36,transparent do i need to build it for it
1226.08,4.32,to be adopted at some point what types
1229.36,3.84,of
1230.4,5.36,biases in the data collection and then
1233.2,4.56,also in the usage we now call it the
1235.76,3.279,bias but we're still struggling with the
1237.76,4.0,society
1239.039,4.64,not really living up to his expectations
1241.76,3.84,and then machine learning bringing it to
1243.679,4.0,the forefront right and so to say that
1245.6,3.84,another way when you're collecting data
1247.679,3.441,from the real world and then building
1249.44,4.16,machine learning systems that automate
1251.12,4.88,decisions based on that data all of the
1253.6,4.72,biases and problems that are already in
1256.0,4.24,the real world then can be magnified
1258.32,3.68,through that machine learning system and
1260.24,3.36,so it can make many of these problems
1262.0,3.12,much worse feeling increasingly
1263.6,2.4,challenged
1265.12,3.36,that
1266.0,4.159,my skill set of being very good at
1268.48,4.319,programming has become somewhat
1270.159,4.64,secondary and it's really
1272.799,4.721,it's really the bigger picture
1274.799,4.721,understanding of who would be using that
1277.52,4.8,how transparent do i need to build it
1279.52,4.399,for it to be adopted at some point what
1282.32,4.32,types of
1283.919,5.521,biases in the data collection and then
1286.64,5.6,also in the usage i think in certain
1289.44,5.52,areas we have societal expectations as
1292.24,6.4,to what is fair and what isn't
1294.96,5.599,and so it's not just the provenance of
1298.64,3.6,that data but it's sort of deeply
1300.559,3.761,understanding why does it look the way
1302.24,4.08,it looks why was it collected this way
1304.32,3.599,what are the limitations of it we need
1306.32,3.92,to think about that in
1307.919,4.961,entire process how we document that
1310.24,4.799,process this is an issue in companies
1312.88,4.48,where somebody might create something
1315.039,4.561,that even their peers can't recreate
1317.36,4.96,what have you seen in terms of which
1319.6,6.88,industries where they stand like who is
1322.32,6.32,adopting now who is ready to utilize it
1326.48,3.679,where would you maybe wish they didn't
1328.64,3.76,even try
1330.159,4.64,these are great questions so things like
1332.4,4.0,actuarial science operations research
1334.799,3.201,where they actually are not using
1336.4,4.0,machine learning as much as you might
1338.0,5.2,think and then you have other sorts of
1340.4,4.96,companies or on the fintech side or even
1343.2,4.64,the ad tech side of things where they
1345.36,5.76,perhaps are using machine learning um to
1347.84,4.8,the point of even absurdity so i spent
1351.12,4.16,about eight years
1352.64,5.279,working in atec and
1355.28,7.04,the motivation was really because it was
1357.919,6.64,such an amazingly exciting playground to
1362.32,5.44,push that technology that used to
1364.559,5.201,largely live in academia really
1367.76,5.039,out in the world and see kind of what it
1369.76,5.44,can achieve it has created such a hunger
1372.799,4.321,for data that now
1375.2,5.76,everything is being collected i'm
1377.12,5.679,curious when are we going to
1380.96,4.24,make a foray into things like
1382.799,5.521,agriculture about
1385.2,4.64,smart production of the things we eat
1388.32,4.32,you see and hear these interesting
1389.84,6.24,stories but i feel like we're not ready
1392.64,6.0,yet to put that into a economically
1396.08,5.2,viable situation so when we think about
1398.64,5.36,the next five to ten years the things
1401.28,5.92,that are really still holding us back
1404.0,6.32,are these uneven applications of
1407.2,5.2,resources to problems because the
1410.32,4.16,problems that get attention are the high
1412.4,3.759,value ones in terms of how much money
1414.48,3.199,you can make or the things that are
1416.159,3.361,fashionable enough that you can publish
1417.679,5.281,a paper on it so what do you think is
1419.52,5.279,holding us back i fully agree on the
1422.96,4.48,steps you pointed out and and the
1424.799,4.48,processes i think there is a chicken and
1427.44,5.76,neck problem like your former example
1429.279,5.28,that these areas that need to wait
1433.2,3.599,for data
1434.559,4.161,the value of the data collection is then
1436.799,4.161,also slightly less
1438.72,4.88,apparent and so it gets delayed further
1440.96,4.4,and you see that happening but what my
1443.6,4.48,experience has been
1445.36,7.28,yes unfortunately i feel a
1448.08,7.04,drifting apart between academia and the
1452.64,5.6,uses of ai but i'm
1455.12,6.32,somewhat frustrated with a generation of
1458.24,4.799,students who have standard data sets
1461.44,3.599,that they never think about what the
1463.039,3.841,model needs to be used for
1465.039,4.161,that they never have to think about how
1466.88,5.36,the data was collected so with all these
1469.2,4.32,challenges ahead of us how optimistic
1472.24,2.72,are you about
1473.52,4.88,this world that
1474.96,5.44,i deeply believe we can uh create
1478.4,4.879,and the steps towards it
1480.4,5.04,i am incredibly optimistic and uh
1483.279,4.801,perhaps it's a personality flaw but i
1485.44,5.68,can't help but look at
1488.08,5.36,the potential of the technology to
1491.12,4.559,reduce harm to give us information to
1493.44,4.239,help us make better decisions and to
1495.679,5.281,think that we would choose
1497.679,4.641,to address the big problems ahead of us
1500.96,3.68,i don't think we have a hope of
1502.32,4.239,addressing them without figuring out the
1504.64,3.84,role that machine learning will play and
1506.559,5.12,to think that we would then choose not
1508.48,5.679,to do that is just unthinkable despite
1511.679,4.561,the rightfully
1514.159,2.88,concerns about the challenges ahead but
1516.24,4.24,i think
1517.039,6.88,they also make us a society better they
1520.48,5.679,challenge us to be a lot clearer of
1523.919,6.481,what fairness means to us means to all
1526.159,7.601,of us so with all of the setbacks
1530.4,4.32,i think we have exciting years to come
1533.76,2.96,and
1534.72,3.76,i am looking forward to a world where a
1536.72,5.47,lot more of that is
1538.48,6.799,used for the right purposes
1542.19,5.089,[Music]
1545.279,4.161,i hope you learned something about
1547.279,4.161,machine learning there has never been a
1549.44,4.0,better time to study machine learning
1551.44,4.88,because you're now able to build
1553.44,6.0,products that have tremendous potential
1556.32,6.29,and impact across any industry or area
1559.44,6.63,that you might be excited about
1562.61,3.46,[Music]
