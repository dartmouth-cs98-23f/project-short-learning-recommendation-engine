7.49,3.94,hello guys and welcome today I want to
9.6,3.93,talk about quantum computers and how
11.43,4.98,they can be practically applied to solve
13.53,4.889,our most everyday problems especially I
16.41,3.9,will talk about the latest developments
18.419,4.2,and the latest machines that were built
20.31,3.869,by now on top of that I will talk how
22.619,3.601,they can be applied in the fields of
24.179,4.11,biology and medicine in the fields of
26.22,4.979,logistics in a field of cryptology and
28.289,6.09,protecting our data as well as in fields
31.199,5.91,of finance which will go from banks do
34.379,4.561,optimizing the work of stock market and
37.109,3.57,stock exchange which there's a really
38.94,2.959,large topic and I will especially
40.679,3.45,develop on it
41.899,4.271,first of all let's briefly go over what
44.129,3.811,quantum computers are the basis of it
46.17,3.84,lies in a completely new approach to the
47.94,4.669,computing instead of relying on the
50.01,5.279,classical bits that are either 1 or 0
52.609,4.901,the qubits combine both since themselves
55.289,4.89,the salaah seems to exist in multiple
57.51,4.619,states at once enabling them to conduct
60.179,4.141,a large multitude of computations at the
62.129,4.711,same time this is comparable to a
64.32,5.01,Schrodinger's cat 2 can exist in two
66.84,4.73,states at once qubits can be made of
69.33,6.36,anything that exhibits quantum behavior
71.57,6.28,molecules atoms electrons etc there
75.69,4.62,would be even more accurate than the
77.85,5.67,classical sodium based computers that
80.31,6.12,have 70 to 200 percent error chance in
83.52,4.65,their computation due to it not to
86.43,4.41,mention that the more electrons in a
88.17,4.95,molecule are used for such purpose the
90.84,4.98,more possible states for it sir would be
93.12,6.48,for example a molecule with 10 electrons
95.82,5.52,will have 1000 possible States while a
99.6,4.68,molecule with 20 electrons will have
101.34,4.98,over 1 million of possible States there
104.28,3.72,is also quantum entanglements it must be
106.32,4.1,mentioned it interlinks all of the
108.0,4.74,qubits allowing them to operate together
110.42,4.39,together with superposition it allows
112.74,4.05,quantum computers to process large
114.81,4.5,quantities of information in far greater
116.79,4.89,amounts than what classical computers
119.31,4.35,can process quantum computers can
121.68,4.41,calculate infinite possibilities for
123.66,4.5,their inputs they can model more complex
126.09,4.35,algorithms and develop far more
128.16,3.78,intricate and sophisticated models the
130.44,3.6,most practical application of it would
131.94,3.0,be processing vast amounts of market
134.04,3.12,data
134.94,4.89,stock-exchange modeling molecules was
137.16,5.34,all over details and intricacies for
139.83,4.61,pharmacological purposes and calculating
142.5,5.58,the most optimal logistical routes and
144.44,5.14,those are just the name of you there are
148.08,3.81,two most common types of quantum
149.58,5.19,computers first is based on the quantum
151.89,4.71,gate model and quantum circuits in a way
154.77,4.71,it resembles the current classical
156.6,5.49,computers IBM Q system one would be is a
159.48,4.26,perfect example of such it is a first
162.09,4.08,full-fledged commercially available
163.74,4.8,quantum computer it was introduced
166.17,4.83,earlier this year second type are the
168.54,4.29,superconducting quantum computers the
171.0,3.57,largest ones have over two thousand
172.83,4.17,cubits and are produced by d-wave
174.57,4.2,systems those rely on quantum annealing
177.0,4.02,which is global minimum of a given
178.77,4.95,function over given set of candidate
181.02,4.77,solutions to get a better practical
183.72,4.14,understanding and how those computers to
185.79,5.01,work on practice let's take a look at
187.86,4.68,IBM Q there are two main conditions that
190.8,4.05,have to be met in order for the quantum
192.54,4.05,computer to work first is achieving near
194.85,6.06,absolute zero temperature which is
196.59,7.2,around - 237 degrees Celsius second is
200.91,4.95,the absolute vacuum those are no easy to
203.79,3.3,achieve and maintain but they have been
205.86,4.05,attained
207.09,5.369,in IBM Q system one and its previous
209.91,4.5,iteration on top of that there is a good
212.459,4.321,reason for the entire computer to be
214.41,5.46,encased in protective metal cylinder and
216.78,5.7,placed in a hardened glass box Quantum
219.87,4.5,chips are extremely fragile and even the
222.48,5.729,slightest interference will be damaging
224.37,6.66,present the prototype has managed to get
228.209,5.25,twenty cubits working and operational it
231.03,4.739,has also doubled its QV network volume
233.459,4.921,from eight to sixteen in comparison to
235.769,4.141,the last iteration such computing power
238.38,4.5,opens a great potential for the
239.91,4.98,practical applications in addition the
242.88,4.74,considerable computing power it has the
244.89,5.94,lowest error rates which are around one
247.62,5.91,or two percent that are some of the
250.83,4.77,lowest what IBM has ever measured this
253.53,3.84,is the quantum rated computer meanings
255.6,4.02,it is on par with the current classical
257.37,4.5,ones the future plans involve creating a
259.62,4.799,computer with a quantum supremacy or a
261.87,5.07,quantum ready computer in IBM's terms
264.419,3.621,that it will have a greater computing
266.94,2.66,power than
268.04,3.57,classical computers this should be
269.6,4.89,achieved in around three to five years
271.61,4.47,if everything goes to schedule as the
274.49,4.98,most advanced quantum computer is the
276.08,5.22,one used by Google it has 72 qubits and
279.47,4.38,Google has already claimed that it has
281.3,5.34,reached quantum superiority not so long
283.85,5.34,ago which is a considerable milestone in
286.64,4.89,quantum computing another interesting
289.19,5.82,device is being developed by the Rosetta
291.53,5.16,computing they aim to build 128 qubit
295.01,4.26,computers that will be unveiled this
296.69,4.53,year it has developed under a new form
299.27,4.2,factor as the Klan's itself to rapid
301.22,4.5,scaling because of their in-house design
303.47,4.14,with all of the teams working close
305.72,4.59,together they should be able to develop
307.61,5.4,and deploy new systems really quickly
310.31,5.07,also Bottom computers are a new valid
313.01,3.96,application of Moore's law and should
315.38,4.41,doubles a computer transistors
316.97,4.77,performance every every year this should
319.79,4.23,culminate in one of the goals of quantum
321.74,4.11,computing creating a big enough quantum
324.02,3.6,computers it will be infinitely more
325.85,3.59,powerful than any classical computer
327.62,4.35,that has ever existed
329.44,4.39,the first extremely practical
331.97,3.93,applications that would affect a lot of
333.83,4.62,people would be the simulations of the
335.9,5.64,biological molecules this would allow a
338.45,5.19,significantly improved drug design and
341.54,4.11,better determine positive treatment
343.64,4.29,effects as well as negative side-effects
345.65,4.14,another probable application would be
347.93,4.29,the quantum applications for the
349.79,4.8,Internet first of all it will involve
352.22,4.35,encoding a qubit with Farmar information
354.59,4.17,than a conventional bit can handle
356.57,5.67,second it will improve the security of
358.76,5.31,transmitted messages on top of quantum
362.24,3.54,encoding it will be also possible to
364.07,3.69,detect any attempts to intercept
365.78,4.38,messages due to the nature of qubits
367.76,5.22,react when they were influenced by any
370.16,5.46,third party intruder such as malicious
372.98,4.41,hacker or something like that it will be
375.62,2.19,possible to switch to the quantum
377.39,2.7,Internet
377.81,4.86,once existing broadband technologies are
380.09,4.59,improved photons can be used as qubits
382.67,4.65,which makes fiber-optic cables
384.68,4.44,applicable for search purposes moreover
387.32,4.32,a recent breakthrough by Australian
389.12,4.71,scientists can make erbium the prime
391.64,4.529,substance for enabling it in existing
393.83,4.05,networks they have found that applying a
396.169,4.141,large magnetic field can greatly improve
397.88,3.809,the quantum storage tab for certain
400.31,3.509,nervion crystals
401.689,4.71,this field which is similar to that
403.819,4.56,inside the hospital MRI machine quite
406.399,5.19,the magnetic field fluctuations the
408.379,6.72,erbium time can then improve by a factor
411.589,5.19,of thousand to more than one second the
415.099,3.96,most fascinating applications of quantum
416.779,5.55,computers are in the fields of finance
419.059,5.13,and probably the most complex ones the
422.329,4.41,entire financial market can be modeled
424.189,4.11,as a quantum process where quantities
426.739,4.83,that are usable for quantum computing
428.299,5.61,such as covariance matrix emerged
431.569,4.08,naturally in addition to that some
433.909,4.02,well-known financial problems can be
435.649,4.32,directly expressed in quantum mechanical
437.929,3.84,form there were the scientific papers as
439.969,5.4,well deeply into research in this
441.769,5.49,subject of applying quantum algorithm to
445.369,3.6,solve existing financial tests
447.259,3.42,not to mention that having such
448.969,3.391,operating point of computer was large
450.679,3.6,enough capacity would provide a
452.36,4.589,significant advantage to the ones who
454.279,4.74,would actually own it first of all a
456.949,4.11,large number of problems and finders
459.019,4.29,have to do is optimization those can be
461.059,4.801,addressed with quantum annealer x' as it
463.309,4.26,were mentioned earlier a valid
465.86,4.289,application would be searching for
467.569,4.53,patterns in the pasted data in order to
470.149,4.14,predict future market patterns and
472.099,4.56,fluctuations which is the core of any
474.289,4.261,more than technical analysis it can be
476.659,3.51,greatly enhanced with improved machine
478.55,3.959,learning speed set quantum computers
480.169,4.17,provide which would be both faster and
482.509,4.02,more affordable than existing methods a
484.339,4.65,long example to go through larger debt
486.529,4.44,at quantities said classical computers
488.989,4.59,are capable of and that they can handle
490.969,4.62,and even more serviced and then you'll
493.579,6.69,increase in the number of qubits that we
495.589,6.9,should expect finance also deals with
500.269,4.44,uncertainty of future behavior of assets
502.489,4.08,and their projected returns risk in
504.709,4.02,financial terms is a possibility of
506.569,5.12,difference between actual and expected
508.729,5.73,return these risk can be purposely
511.689,5.171,mitigated particularly in case of high
514.459,4.56,return risky assets by selecting
516.86,4.709,additional assets and creating a more
519.019,4.231,stable portfolio both portfolios and
521.569,3.96,assets are in critically
523.25,4.62,random systems due to inherently
525.529,4.951,incomplete knowledge of the market this
527.87,4.8,randomness is risks it is very difficult
530.48,5.13,to estimate however a numerical
532.67,5.099,simulation such as Monte Carlo one can
535.61,4.229,be used to estimate what an option is
537.769,4.081,Wars and quantum computers can be
539.839,4.5,applied to solve relative conditional
541.85,5.04,issues in such calculations in this case
544.339,4.831,portfolio optimization can be done using
546.89,4.98,a model that is trained to identify the
549.17,4.56,important data then it can be used to
551.87,3.6,predict the behavior in data points
553.73,3.299,which is basically the process of
555.47,3.359,machine learning the particular
557.029,3.81,improvements if quantum computers
558.829,4.861,provide would be in splitting up as a
560.839,5.281,training of such a model Monte Carlo
563.69,4.589,methods statistical sampling can usually
566.12,4.29,be implemented efficiently they would
568.279,4.261,however require more rounds to provide
570.41,4.859,an accurate estimation of the expected
572.54,4.739,return and its distribution its accuracy
575.269,5.01,can be further improved by modeling the
577.279,4.771,parameters as statistic functions the
580.279,4.351,answer is a colossal computational power
582.05,4.62,required to accurately describe the
584.63,4.079,system this only gets higher as the
586.67,3.63,amount of data gathered increases which
588.709,3.931,is an issue that quantum computers are
590.3,4.71,best suited to solve and the fast
592.64,5.28,reserve required algorithms can run the
595.01,5.13,creator's advantage to provide robust
597.92,4.71,our algorithm is another important
600.14,4.259,application of quantum algorithms its
602.63,4.38,function is finding a particular
604.399,4.5,register in unordered database at the
607.01,4.259,significantly greater efficiencies and
608.899,4.591,typical algorithms it can be adapted to
611.269,4.831,solve optimization problems help to find
613.49,5.099,flow like variables and implement Monte
616.1,4.26,Carlo methods as a biodynamic portfolio
618.589,3.0,optimization was successfully done on
620.36,3.06,develop chips
621.589,4.531,proving that and can be solved with high
623.42,4.83,success rate on quantum computers in the
626.12,4.469,previous dimension research paper there
628.25,4.47,are other formulas that demonstrates
630.589,5.701,exact working of the quantum algorithms
632.72,5.1,listed in this video if one desires to
636.29,4.049,get a deeper understanding of its
637.82,5.759,workings I would HIGHLY advise a reader
640.339,6.091,to follow the link below to the research
643.579,5.311,document let's take another financial
646.43,4.71,practice that can be better solved using
648.89,3.9,quantum algorithms arbitrage the
651.14,3.87,practice of making a profit from
652.79,4.62,different prices on the same asset in
655.01,4.13,different markets the problems of the
657.41,3.9,subject are empty heart
659.14,2.889,non-deterministic polynomial time
661.31,2.7,heartless
662.029,4.081,which makes them perfect for quantum
664.01,4.56,algorithms to handle particularly for
666.11,4.47,quantum annealer more OERs
668.57,5.07,practical instances of arbitrage
670.58,5.31,problems that were converted into super
673.64,4.8,attic unconstrained binary optimization
675.89,5.31,or cubo that when implemented on the
678.44,5.13,wave quantum annealer have produced the
681.2,4.59,same optimal solutions as exhaustive
683.57,4.38,classical solver another important
685.79,4.32,financial issue the quantum computers
687.95,4.86,can successfully tackle is credit
690.11,5.43,scoring being the basis of determining
692.81,5.43,the risk of a loan and the likelihood of
695.54,5.46,the board defaulting on payments it can
698.24,6.03,be translated to q-ball problem as well
701.0,4.98,it can be run on quantum annealer apart
704.27,3.99,from that the problems that arise from
705.98,4.32,lack of data or from having to deal with
708.26,4.14,large quantities of data are prime
710.3,4.68,subject of quantum computers to deal
712.4,6.03,with in this case it was implemented as
714.98,5.61,proof principle in one qubit as DK took
718.43,4.26,it and the results have shown that
720.59,4.17,future quantum annealer can be used to
722.69,4.56,find optimal features in credit analysis
724.76,4.14,it is also important to elaborate on the
727.25,3.36,prospects of machine learning with
728.9,4.02,quantum computers as was previously
730.61,4.23,mentioned the entire process can be made
732.92,4.65,more efficient and less time-consuming
734.84,6.78,an tapas etsu produced algorithms can
737.57,6.75,pickle a large diversity of tasks those
741.62,5.04,would include pattern recognition data
744.32,4.41,classification and many more the
746.66,4.29,training of AI to perform those tasks
748.73,4.2,can be significantly improved let's take
750.95,4.65,a look at classification algorithms in
752.93,4.68,our example each data point which is a
755.6,4.38,customer can be expressed as a vector
757.61,5.01,with vector space of all considered
759.98,5.13,attributes each vector in turn would
762.62,4.86,belong to a class a certain loan risk
765.11,4.83,such as classification algorithm would
767.48,4.89,be an accession to for financial
769.94,3.99,predictions and the methods for running
772.37,3.45,the classification algorithms on a
773.93,3.72,quantum computer would be generally
775.82,4.71,focused on efficiently performing
777.65,5.6,projection operations I'm more Brossard
780.53,5.58,and gaps were pioneers of the idea of
783.25,4.51,recasting the above problem in a quantum
786.11,4.53,computer by expressing each data point
787.76,6.15,as a quantum state they develop the idea
790.64,6.0,of per month to efficiently estimate the
793.91,5.46,classical distance between states by
796.64,4.259,repeatedly performing swap tests alloyed
799.37,3.959,also suggested out
800.899,5.16,method for encoding classical data in a
803.329,5.461,quantum state while also relying on swap
806.059,4.861,des in both efficiency that is graters
808.79,4.019,in classical algorithms there are also
810.92,4.589,early suggestions for the application of
812.809,5.0,quantum code classification algorithms
815.509,5.101,to present recognition problems
817.809,4.75,financial supply chain management is an
820.61,3.509,important subject as well it has to do
822.559,3.81,with meeting customer demand while
824.119,4.14,avoiding unwanted stock same as
826.369,3.96,classification algorithms it requires
828.259,4.68,taking a significant number of factors
830.329,5.79,into account relate to every specific
832.939,5.37,problem it requires to learn an American
836.119,4.801,from the training data set and employs
838.309,4.681,regression core tool for economic
840.92,4.169,forecasting it is used to gain an
842.99,4.439,understanding of causal typical value of
845.089,4.23,a response variable changes as an
847.429,3.75,attribute is varied the optimal
849.319,4.71,parameters are found by minimizing the
851.179,4.801,least squares error between the training
854.029,4.86,data and the values predicted by the
855.98,5.909,model done by defining certain inverse
858.889,5.461,of the training data metrics this can be
861.889,4.831,computationally expensive for classical
864.35,6.06,datasets but not for the quantum ones
866.72,6.0,also V Brown and Lloyd managed to apply
870.41,4.32,a powerful mathematical toolbox to
872.72,4.77,perform regression on quantum computer
874.73,5.159,answer example as sparse training data
877.49,4.829,matrix was used to encode the models
879.889,5.04,optimal fit parameters into the
882.319,4.32,amplitudes of quantum state which is far
884.929,4.051,faster than the fastest classical
886.639,5.31,algorithm Bank has managed to improve
888.98,5.01,the NIT by applying modern methods for
891.949,4.411,matrix inversion and generalizing the
893.99,3.349,algorithm to non sparse training data
896.36,3.719,matrices
897.339,5.59,another method applicable to this kind
900.079,5.161,of death was Gaussian process regression
902.929,5.941,the last development of the subject was
905.24,5.969,done by shoot semi ski and British Shana
908.87,4.709,who managed to solve the expensive data
911.209,4.951,size problem by encoding the regression
913.579,5.521,model into a quantum state however the
916.16,5.7,solution is rather inconvenient with the
919.1,4.649,current station this development in
921.86,3.81,terms of project fully optimization it
923.749,4.291,is very important to have a global
925.67,3.719,vision of interest rate pass even when
928.04,3.659,dealing with hundreds of swap
929.389,5.13,instruments a standard machine learning
931.699,3.271,to for this principal component analysis
934.519,4.041,or
934.97,7.47,PC a it amounts to finding dominant
938.56,6.82,eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a very
942.44,5.52,large matrix however when the number of
945.38,4.77,stocks reaches over millions the cost
947.96,4.62,becomes astronomical the PCA algorithm
950.15,5.27,can be run exponentially faster and the
952.58,4.89,quantum processor it allows us to find
955.42,4.51,approximations to the principal
957.47,5.4,components of a correlation matrix as
959.93,5.52,well as estimate risk and maximize
962.87,5.19,profit in situations not feasible using
965.45,4.29,classical methods neural networks have
968.06,3.93,proved to be extremely successful at
969.74,4.38,predicting markets and analyzing credit
971.99,4.32,risk the key to their success lies in
974.12,4.11,the ability to tackle tasks which
976.31,2.91,require intuitive judgment for
978.23,2.94,incomplete datasets
979.22,4.23,this makes them essential for financial
981.17,4.91,prediction c2 can be accelerated through
983.45,4.32,quantum computing quantum annealer scan
986.08,4.57,significantly reduce the computational
987.77,4.74,cost of machine learning moreover once
990.65,3.66,trades algorithm can be used on any
992.51,3.81,classical computer the previous
994.31,4.65,dimension PCA can be used to speed up
996.32,6.66,the process exponentially and fooled new
998.96,5.28,quantum neural network algorithms can be
1002.98,3.48,designed for that purpose
1004.24,5.19,altogether allowing the network to learn
1006.46,4.62,much more complex data projects coming
1009.43,3.18,back to Monte Carlos methods they
1011.08,4.08,performed best when dealing with
1012.61,4.74,extremely large or complex systems that
1015.16,4.17,can be handled otherwise as the
1017.35,3.9,stochastic approach is usually used to
1019.33,3.8,simulate the effect of uncertainties
1021.25,4.47,affecting the given financial object
1023.13,4.959,which can be stocks portfolios or
1025.72,4.229,options which makes Monte Carlo methods
1028.089,4.021,applicable to portfolio evaluation
1029.949,4.89,personal finance planning risk
1032.11,5.04,evaluation and derivatives pricing in
1034.839,4.801,order to obtain the most probable
1037.15,4.71,outcome of wide distribution or to get
1039.64,4.049,resolved with a very small associated
1041.86,4.92,error the necessary number of Monte
1043.689,4.711,Carlo simulation can become gigantic for
1046.78,3.54,example stock market simulations that
1048.4,4.56,are usually day-long simulations a
1050.32,4.52,quantum speed-up would bring a huge
1052.96,4.65,change greatly speeding up the process
1054.84,5.5,the first steps were down by Brossard
1057.61,4.8,courrier mosa and tab in the first part
1060.34,4.11,documented in the research paper the

1068.15,5.01,item which can be used to get the
1071.15,3.87,quadratic speed-up in calculation of
1073.16,3.98,expectation values by Monte Carlo
1075.02,5.76,sampling it applies a series of QA
1077.14,5.98,operations followed by QFT from shorts
1080.78,4.44,quantum factoring algorithm to measure
1083.12,4.08,the approximate amplitude of any given
1085.22,2.52,state developing from the obtained
1087.2,2.67,results
1087.74,3.72,Montanaro showed that Monte Carlo
1089.87,3.66,simulations can run on a quantum
1091.46,4.89,computer with the same accuracy as
1093.53,5.73,classical machines as with quadratically
1096.35,4.91,fewer samples required je algorithm
1099.26,4.44,serving a source of a speedo
1101.26,4.69,additionally if random sampling is
1103.7,4.31,performed strict quantum algorithm this
1105.95,4.77,can provide a nozzle speed increase
1108.01,4.84,building up Montoneros work roben
1110.72,4.74,crossed route and Bromley suggested
1112.85,4.95,using quantum accelerated Monte Carlo to
1115.46,4.95,obtain quadratic speed-up in pricing
1117.8,4.95,financial derivatives while of Warner
1120.41,5.66,and dagger pioneers the idea of adapting
1122.75,6.72,the core principles of such efficiently
1126.07,6.04,estimating var and see var for financial
1129.47,5.07,risk analysis by applying qae algorithms
1132.11,4.92,they determined that var which is Value
1134.54,4.89,at Risk and C var which is conditional
1137.03,5.22,value at risk with a quadratic speed-up
1139.43,6.18,as well and it was actually tested by M
1142.25,5.25,the IBM experienced quantum computers
1145.61,3.81,already have several applications in the
1147.5,3.84,field of violence moreover some of those
1149.42,4.2,applications were tested and yielded
1151.34,3.69,great results that's considering the
1153.62,3.24,current initial stage of their
1155.03,3.69,development therefore it can be
1156.86,3.9,concluded that it's greater
1158.72,4.17,Z increases our computing power will be
1160.76,4.32,the greater will be the speed ups and
1162.89,4.23,the more tests they will be able to
1165.08,3.42,handle it is quite certain that at one
1167.12,3.6,point they will become powerful enough
1168.5,2.82,to become destructive in the field of
1170.72,2.76,violence
1171.32,3.99,meaning that whoever would own a
1173.48,3.9,powerful quantum computing machine would
1175.31,4.2,have a tremendous advantage over others
1177.38,4.74,it is important to note that the above
1179.51,4.88,are only a few of possible applications
1182.12,4.86,and such fields as quantum teleportation
1184.39,4.15,have not even been mentioned by now it
1186.98,3.75,is evident that quantum computers are
1188.54,4.35,growing in their computing power at an
1190.73,3.69,increasing rate the greatest example
1192.89,3.66,would be the machine that has already
1194.42,4.74,achieved count of superiority which is
1196.55,4.79,created and developed by Google and the
1199.16,4.04,faster development goes the
1201.34,3.54,oceans and companies will be drawn to
1203.2,3.51,quantum computing which will bring a
1204.88,3.57,trait of the development speed with
1206.71,3.62,everyone contributing their part is a
1208.45,3.93,grandiose technological development
1210.33,3.55,think of watching the video if you
1212.38,3.03,really enjoyed it please give us a like
1213.88,3.93,and subscribe to our channel for more
1215.41,5.52,videos like that next topic will be
1217.81,4.95,terraforming Mars and moon and what
1220.93,4.08,potential technologies we can apply for
1222.76,3.99,it as well as what the technology that
1225.01,5.04,can develop in order to facilitate it
1226.75,6.24,and by that I mean developing a fully
1230.05,5.88,livable atmosphere and fully livable
1232.99,5.94,ecosystem for us humans as well as for
1235.93,5.73,animals for plants so to be able to
1238.93,4.62,create something resembling Earth also
