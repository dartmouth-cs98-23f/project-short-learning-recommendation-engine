welcome to
the webinar so
uh i'm antholon in charge of the human
computer attraction major at old
university i'm really happy to be here
it's the first webinar that i do in this
this role
and i've put together a presentation
that goes over
the contents and the
requirements and some opportunities that
we have and overall just gives a flavor
of of how we think and approach teaching
here
if you have questions i i guess we're
going to be taking them after the talk
so um please uh meanwhile of course you
can put them into chat we'll be
moderating a q a after that
um
couldn't make it today but he's my
deputy so he's associate professor of
game ai and game design at elder school
of uh sciences and now the school of
arts is jointly
appointed between these two schools
i'm at the school of electrical
engineering and as you see we're hosting
this program together uh with this uh
two schools ski and elec
and i'm in charge of the user interfaces
group uh if you're interested in what we
do you can you can look at our page i'll
just put the
link here but
from now on i'm going to be talking
about the program and the major so um
first of all i'll go through all the
universities just know who we are and uh
what's our
mode of operation and and what's our
mission and vision
and then i'm going to talk about the
major and how that's constructed and
what kind of courses you will be facing
if you come here and what kind of
opportunities you will be having
during the course season and of course
after that
um first of all a couple of words about
aldo so alde was formed roughly about 10
years ago
and
it had this mission of breaking
boundaries that you you would normally
have uh if you think about universities
and their departments and faculties and
and so on and try to have a
constellation and
that can address some some of these
societally important challenges like
sustainability and creativity in in
novel ways
and uh here's a timeline of
where the different universities come
from that came together to become old
university roughly roughly 10 years
10 years ago
and
one one of the things that we're really
proud of is our internationality so
maybe honey knows the statistics better
that we have a strong
contribution from
international students and research
faculty as well
i can't remember the exact proportions
but we're talking about 30 40 percent
across the board
that are the figures i cannot remember
then
exactly but yeah we are one of the most
uh international universities in europe
so
yeah that's really visible because we've
been also growing our attractiveness in
terms of students and the research
faculty intake so so you see that
whenever we open anything there we get
you know lots of different uh lots of
applications around the world
and that has helped us sort of ramp up
the quality of everything that we do
here
and um you know partial partially that's
because um of the mission that we have
that people find very very um
inspiring the other thing that i want to
raise up is our startup scene which is
also really strong
[Music]
you know around the compost that we have
in um in espo
if you if you look at two two kilometer
diameter somebody said that we have
roughly 100 companies there
in addition we have uh events like slash
and lots of uh business
incubators and so on and students have
lots of opportunities to join these
startups if they're interested in those
um so it's more more than just a degree
it's it's a it's a it's an experience
and also there's very lively communities
that are formed around uh students and
and uh international visitors and and so
on
and of course that has been a bit of a
hiatus because of the covet but nowhere
i think we're approaching status quo
soon
there are many rankings and all
universities will show you similar
rankings that they're really excellent
but something that i really want to
emphasize here that i'm very proud of is
that we're
you know one of the best young
universities i remember that we were
just established
around 11 years ago
and uh you know we're ranked as number
nine
among young universities globally we're
also very good in multi-disciplinary and
collaborative research which is you know
part of the student experience as well
as i'm going to show
the particular subject which is human
computer action is also highly ranked
i'll show you some some data on that
later
so you can you can be sure when you join
aldo you will be uh
resting on on state-of-the-art research
and activities
something that's also really nice uh is
that we have a really beautiful campus
it's it's in a bay uh there's a bird
reserved area and also forests it's
really walkable there's still a lively
uh center part which is just built
around a metro station and a mall
which is also quite new development so
it is easily reached and it's also
having all of the services and lots of
restaurants and stuff like that
and we've been building that uh compost
with the idea of increasing
sustainability
good um i don't know if you know much
about finland but finland has been
systematically ranked as one of the top
countries when it comes to
happiness and safety and so social uh
welfare
and uh you know it is a really safe
place to live and
there's a lot of nature and
you know most finns speak uh english
fluently so you'll find it easily easy
to to get around here especially in
helsinki metropolitan area right there
even the the mayor was suggesting that
we should we should add english as an
official language and he wasn't joking
so
maybe one day we'll have that
let's then talk about the program so
there's a bigger program called computer
communication and information sciences
so that's
for short
and underneath that umbrella there are
many majors and human computer
interaction is one of them
and human computer action is
a multi-disciplinary field that is that
is taking contributions from computer
science electrical engineering
also psychology and social sciences and
design
and we try to bring all of those
elements into our education but
nonetheless we have chosen a technical
focus and i'm going to talk about that
later so we want to ensure that our
students are not
you know just getting a generalist
education in hci but they have sort of a
sharp edge in their teaching that allows
them to to land
you know very good jobs
so i'll talk about that um
in a minute so why hci if you think
about ict as a whole i mean it's the
driving force in many many ways at the
moment
and uh nowadays if you think about
you know networking and computing
resources and all those magnesium
magnificent technical capabilities you
know they have made almost anything
possible and the question is what should
we do with this technology and that's
where human-centeredness becomes into
the picture and and human attraction is
uh is a big field within uh computer
science and information technology
and uh
this is a program to to be introduced
introduced to that field
[Music]
i
we've been building this program or this
major over a few years now and um
one design principle has been that we
would like to offer a very close contact
with research and that basically means
that we have
you know smaller studio-like
courses and also research project
courses and we offer a lot of
possibilities in terms of doing theses
work with the
groups and we're i'm going to show a
picture gallery all of us there
all the professors and um but you see
that we're quite big uh as when it comes
to human conflict interaction and we're
also very successful when it comes to
research and this is starting to be
recognized also internationally
we have
been ranked as number two in europe and
number 15 in the world and we're the
best in in nordic countries if you want
to come here and study hci then i think
we're we have a pretty good offer in
terms of
uh you know world-class
research
um and that's also shown in the
facilities and laboratories that we we
have here in our disposal
for example just in the previous period
we were teaching a user research and as
part of that then the students were
taken to our lab to to look at them and
work with the eye tracking technology in
those labs we have a multitude of other
technologies as well you know we have a
dedicated labs for vr and ar technology
uh then we have you know in our lab we
have uh methods and techniques for
empirical studies including eye trackers
and motion trackers and and whatnot and
then there are some other people who do
like um
fabrication like with 3d printing and
so you will find all of those elements
here
um
then i want to talk more about our uh
specialization here which is which is
you know technical human complete
interaction especially applying
computational and engineering principles
into the design and engineering of
interfaces and
interactive ai
and there's one particular
area called creative technologies that
that's uh becoming more and more central
in everything that we do and i want to
show you a small video reel
capturing many of these ideas it's quite
short
um but it gives a very nice overview of
the kind of work that we do this is
called an augmented climbing wall that
timeline is these are these are aei
generated phases
and here you see uh motion synthesis
that is based on ai that helps to design
better climbing walls
here's the animation
games
that use the body
eocdr technologies interaction
techniques
this is more more games that are
physically based or hexagames
and there's also uh we have a professor
who's working on interactive music
technology this is some stuff from our
lab we do models of human behavior and
use them in computational design
also we helped the french
nation to adopt a new standard for the
keyboards that was designed
so this is an this is a real of some of
the stuff that that we're doing here at
old university and we
we want to offer our students the
possibility of learning those those
technologies and just actually to be
very concrete tomorrow i'm going to be
teaching about one of those things that
that was visible in the videos there was
this by this typing video and i'm going
to talk about quality modeling uh in the
context of our computational api class
um
okay a couple of more examples just to
give you you know a concrete idea what
kind of things you will master after
taking this program
we use ai methods like deep learning
reinforcement and
computational simulation
to generate a human-like behavior so
then they use that as a model to
understand and improve tasks and and
designs for example now how would you
improve uh a techcentric method or
intelligent excellent system they need
to understand some something about how
people move their eyes and make
strategic decisions on how to find it
we have you you will also learn about
computational design which is something
that helps
designers
produce
better designs improve the productivity
improve their creativity
these are actual
uh examples of
this is an actual example where our
student has been involved
doing a
plug-in for designers that helps
designers fix issues with
guideline violations in the capital
interface designs
another student project is here on the
right uh we've been working with a
smartwatch um producer or manufacturer
that
was interested in adding a jester
recognizer that's actually good for real
use or robust enough and then we worked
on deep learning-based gesture
recognizers and collecting really
impressive data set to drain that and
help them improve their robustness
another
slide of examples uh here's the work by
berto hama where they they work with
rodio to do automated game level testing
so in the future
uh you you're not necessarily running an
expensive and vertical studies but using
these ai models of people
maybe they are models of gamers in this
case
to evaluate and design for example game
levels
so what what happens here is that then
you know they gave a game game level to
an ai
robot or bot but that is then trained to
dissolve the game levels and then they
get indices of things like well how
difficult these levels are or how
quickly they would jump out of the game
or and do something else
and so on
what we also do is we work with ai to
improve experimentation with human
subjects um just actually next week uh
you know my pc student is going to teach
our students how to do bayesian
optimization based experimentation that
makes experimentation way more efficient
than it ever used to be
i already showed that this example in
the video review about the keyboards
we teach methods that help or can can
solve some really hard design problems
for example how to uh
assign
characters or letters onto a keyboard or
how to how to do a menu or a web page or
or an interaction technique that is
optimal for for for your users
so we're learning also those methods
so this is giving a an overview of
something you know sharp end of you know
what you're going to learn here
but it's you know by no means limited to
what you just saw
and let me actually talk about the
broader offering that we have
um so i'm i'm here the professor of
interfaces and then we have
um a large number of other people who
are involved in our our teaching
elisa necklace is a professor who came
from switzerland and she has a
background in psychology and she's
interested in studying motivation and
experience so basically what keeps a
gamer motivated and
sustain gaming perks that's one of the
questions
i already showed some of the work that
bert has been doing
then we have a new professor who joined
from rutgers university in the us i am
the lindquist he studies the question
that how to make systems that are both
usable
and
secure and that's an interesting area of
usable security that is a very timely
topic right now
and then we also were joined by a new
professor of practice
anita sony who's looking at human
centered design and he's offering for
example a very timely course on
designing for crises so he was literally
looking at you know how can design
alleviate some of the issues that we
have with covid
and he's been holding this uh for two
times now the seminar
and we're also working with uh the alta
alta school of arts and there we have
our colleagues andres lucero
and uh
and we've been uh deepening our
collaboration with them so we try to
offer more possibilities for our
students to take their courses but also
um their students to take our courses so
that they they would mix and mingle a
little bit
concretely we're offering our students
the possibility of taking a course on
collaborative design which is one of the
highlights of our although school of
arts
research
we're also organizing a computational
design seminar with all the arts in the
in the fall
and we also have
contributions from the ai folks here at
helsinki which is a really strong
program as well we have something like
16 professors in ai and machine learning
and
we have to be taking some key courses
from their offerings just and made them
possible made them available for our
students
we have professor practice johanna kaipi
i think she's known johanna
and her topic is healthcare assistance
usability
and then marconi eminem who's uh in
charge of the strategic usability so
basically how to um strategically
organize
and manage
activities in companies
targeting usability and use experience
so that you're going to get a higher
level
uh
perspective to hci from
from his courses
so this is a gallery of us and of course
we also have elixirs here
um uh on salovara and nikon and many
other ones
and and one of the design principles of
the whole
major has been that we would like to
offer a lot of possibilities for you to
choose courses this is quite unique i
mean many other programs are less that
they move like a train and you have no
no degree of freedom
and uh what we would like to do is that
okay well you can propose your own
specialization right we make certain
courses available and sort of recommend
it but you can go wrong that if you
wanna let's say that you you're
interested in brain computer interfaces
okay well let's talk how you can how you
can specialize in that one you know
maybe you would go to take some of the
courses that we have in neurosciences
and brain imaging and maybe some of the
courses that we have in uh like sensors
and measurement in the electrical
engineering school and maybe some
machine learning
[Music]
contributions as well and you know by
this kind of work then then we'd like to
help you to to specialize in a way that
you you find interesting
and you see here a big portfolio of some
of the ac aci related topics that we
have at alto that uh you know
surprisingly can have
uh you know even the school of chemical
engineering uh they they have for
example
computational design courses they on you
know they don't really do design like we
do but they focus for example the design
the design of um of materials and uh but
nonetheless you know it would teach you
some some basics of
of computational design in in a
methodological perspective that can be
applied in many places then we have also
a school of business and
school of engineering that also have
been offering related things like on
product design and engineering design
but much of the stuff focuses on school
of electrical engineering and school of
science and there we have
three world leading spearhead areas so
there's the computational design that i
briefly showed
interactive machine learnings how to how
to learn
human in the loop and make systems
operate like that and then the other
area is is the game design and game
that i showed that is represented by
elyssa meckler and that's
but as you see we also have people
offering courses and doing research in
the area vr and ar that are very
important at the moment and we're also
building a new uh world-class facility
of 25 million euros called alta studios
which will be a physical space with lots
of different labs that are equipped with
um with state-of-the-art uh equipment uh
vr and ar
so you know this is a portfolio of some
of the stuff that we can offer to you
when you when you get to the stage of
uh picking uh the specializations of
course you don't get to do that
immediately the the point of the
another design principle has been that
uh you first learn certain core things
so that you're then ready you know to
specialize with when you're equipped
with the necessary knowledge to do that
and some of the the common courses
you're going to see here
and um
as you see here uh there's an important
sentence there at top so which is that
you know you you can pick
a selection of these courses let's say
35 if you're doing the long major or 25
if you're doing the shorter major
and you pick among courses like well
social media or human factors or user
interface technologies or
emerging technologies and and um
and you know that's going to give you
a bit of a control over the direction
that you want to take but without
compromising
um
that the core that you need to have in
order to specialize later on
um
this is being updated for next year so
we're going to have more
some changes here for example in terms
of security engineering and
this co-design course that i mentioned
from all the arts and some other changes
as well
okay and after that then then you're
going to have to choose how to
specialize and as i said there's this
very large buffet of courses that you
can take across alt university and
you know i just listed some areas that
are asia related that have been
picked by our students over the years so
just to give you some sampling uh we we
have some offerings in web technology
and if you want to focus on like
interactive web then you would pick our
courses on like interface construction
and web technology
and
maybe user evaluation and user research
and that you know that would form a nice
package for you to then have a
specialization in web technology
similarly we have offerings
in the school of electrical engineering
on speech recognition technology and
natural language processing so pick
something from there and combine that
with our computational hci cores
and you know that allow you then to
build interactive systems that operate
via speeds or always
we have a robotics professor village at
elect
we have an ar and vr competencies at
both ski and elec and related to
professors and classes
uh and so on and so forth right so you
get the sense that um you know there's
lots of possibilities to to pick and mix
the way where you would like so that how
this practically goes is that then at
some point you're asked to do your own
study plan
and that study plan is then reviewed by
me or whoever happens to be in charge of
the program
um and then you get feedback and ideas
on how to
how to pick the best courses so we want
our students to have
you know some challenging courses and
and also
you know thematical orientation that
makes them uh recruitable so that they
they can end it in the next stage after
after getting the degree
good um
this is an overall structure of the
study so there's going to be the common
courses that i showed specialization
that's part of the major and then
there's possibility for elective studies
uh you can pick also
completely outside of the major itself
maybe you do want to do something in
like entrepreneurship or
all the arts they have some excellent
interaction design courses or i don't
know graphic design courses and big big
some of them
and then of course we have master's
thesis
um which is a big part of
of the the study so it's about half a
year
and i'll talk more about massage thesis
in a minute
um
so after your your degree
there are many opportunities in staying
in finland and also during your studies
to get
contact points with the with the finnish
ict industry
we have really strong
ict games and service industries right
here in the capital region
we and we work really closely with the
industry
so we have industry directly funding us
and um you know it's just maybe a
concrete example so so just just
yesterday
uh porsche
the car manufacturer they contacted us
and they want to collaborate with us on
designing
um you know some some new dashboards and
you know maybe that then leads to a
master thesis position that we can offer
to our students
um you know similar opportunities are
then announced on our
internal communication channels where
students are invited
and you know we post the job uh
offerings there
we also have lots of uh internet
internship positions uh internally and
we also encouraged to take internships
outside
and you know we write letters to our
students that then help them design
those positions
um
and we also have very strong uh
telecommunications industry that i
particularly wanna wanna mention so in
addition to the startup community we
have ericsson and nokia
and they're always looking for for
talent also in human compass direction
okay
well if you're not interested in
industry carrier but you rather want to
do a research career uh which i you know
strongly recommend considering
uh we do have a new system called the
doctoral track and hci major is part of
that
control track um it's not
something that uh you you you must take
in order to become a psc student
um that is something that if you have
already decided no you know then you can
apply for this under there's a special
system where you would be doing some
research gigs as a resource assistant in
in close collaboration with four uh
different professors and teams during
the track
so right now there's one student in the
track uh because we just started last
year and she's doing the the last um i
think she's doing the last um
uh gig this this year
actually next year and then she's
starting the masses north species
um you know we were proud that our uh
nazi students are also recruited around
the world to psd
studies you know i i have a very
positive experience of our students
going to top places in the world uh
ethiopia and epfl and university
copenhagen
they all have our students and we
support strongly uh ambitious students
who want to go and do their phd even if
they don't necessarily do that do do
those with us
um
maybe with that we could turn over to
katya
who was kind enough to
give us our student point of view
uh yeah hello everyone my name is katya
and currently i'm doing my second year
of studies in the program human computer
interaction
and
to start with my journey without
university began even before my studies
i
was
i was a recent assistant for a summer
internship in 2019 and
to be honest it was a crucial period for
my decision where i want to go to my
bachelors
so i applied for the master for the
masters in alta and i was accepted and
it was very happy moment for me
and
currently i'm finishing my studies to
start writing master thesis in the
second semester of this year
and speaking about my experience i
switched to beat my domain of interest
for the bachelors i studied social
sciences and social informatics but my
master's program here is a little bit
more technical
uh i'm doing a lot of major in human
computer interaction
and also i do a minor in data analysis
and data science
and it really fascinates me how alton
university provides you provides
opportunities to try different things to
learn more
about the spheres that really interest
you
so currently during these two years i
tried working with some
with some industry cases for example as
auntie told about the course on
collaborative evaluation there with a
bunch of other students we tried to
improve
side website of the
finnish health uh
ministry with like regarding the covet
stuff
and it was a practical case that was
really interesting to try but also there
were a bunch of academic opportunities
like i'm a research assistant in user
interfaces lab and throughout the two
years i tried
different spheres and i worked with
different people there and it is also
[Music]
really helpful to shape your mind and
understand what really
what is really interesting for you and
what do you want to do after the studies
but life in elton university is not only
studies we do have a lot of activities
for students there is a very strong
culture of like student life here and
for example
myself i'm living on the campus like we
have a lot of dormitories
which are very close to all the study
buildings
and here we can like
even like walk a walk around or also we
do have a lot of different activities
like dance clubs or
like theater study
student theater theater sports club and
so on and so forth so it is always a
bunch of opportunities to do something
and now when they like go with situation
is getting better there are a lot of
more and more things you can do around
the campus
and uh speaking about life of life in
finland it's really calm and very very
safe for like from the student's
perspective
and
i can really
say that it is a great opportunity to
to leave and to study like um
so yeah
from me it was the mostly positive
experience and i'm really helpful i'm
really happy with the decisions i made a
couple years ago so that
as i'm in the place i feel like i should
be right now
thanks katya and um
can you say something about your
master's thesis or did you already agree
on the topic because that's super cool
uh right now i don't have my exact topic
yet because i started the position just
a couple days ago
uh but where was speaking about the
design dot ai project which is suppose
supposed to help designers in their work
we're speaking about the plugin for such
tools as figma or sketch where a lot of
where a lot of
technical details requires a lot of
attention from the designer but with the
help of the plug-in some features can be
automized like layouts
transformation or
changing color palettes so
the goal is actually make people's life
easier and i appreciate this so much
because it's just cool to see the
results of your work and yeah
this is really great
thanks katya i i forgot to mention that
i think most of our master's thesis
positions are paid so whether you do
that in industry or within our groups
you get salary for that
and normally what students do is that
they take either ta so teaching
assistant position that is also paid or
which has a system position that is also
paid and then they follow up with them
with the masses this is at some point in
a group so
if you're looking for you know like
sustaining you're living here you know
that's nice uh side income for you as
well
okay um good uh maybe
honey i don't know if you want to say
something about student life which uh
you know i don't have a lot of contact
to
but but there there's a very strong
student union uh we have housing
services and support
we have a good healthcare system for
students and and also
i would say excellent facilities for
sports because they're they're the old
olympic facilities that have been
developed from the 1954
when the olympics were here
in helsinki
and you know so we have a big hall uh
practically with lots of different
facilities for students i don't know
honey if you want to add something on
this
um i think that was quite good but just
to remind everyone that we have housing
around the campus as as katya already
mentioned that she's living living
actually there and then
we have the sense of community the ayy
is a big organization which gathers all
the students at aldo so you always find
help or
uh
friends to do something
and we try to really take care of you
also you know means of health care
which is provided for the students so
there are links to read more about but
we will try to take care of all of our
students
and so now i just want to add that now
that the cove pandemia is over we can
also go back to the regular cycle of of
celebrations which i i think is uh it is
worth mentioning that uh we have the
mayday celebration first of
may
which is a big student event basically
so all the students are former students
they put on the caps and they go and
have fun
so and then there will be lots of
activities around at that time on the
campus related to that
okey-dokey um maybe honda do you want to
say some words about admission i think
it's really well explained on the page
but if there's something special you
want to mention yeah
so
actually the the this year's application
series is coming really soon it starts
in two weeks
it will start on first of december
and
it will end on third of january so that
is the masters application be released
this year and we have masters
application period always once a year
at the end of the year
um
so there's the link
you can see and please check carefully
all the application instructions from
there there's also information about
scholarships and tuition fees that we
offer
and then all the general admission
requirements please remember to check
the all the universities general
admission requirements and then what
this human computer interaction program
has itself
so that is the
info i recommend you to check
really carefully when you are apply and
we are waiting for your applications
that's fun and i i think it makes sense
to tell your story in the letter of
motivation you know why do you want to
study study hci and what
drives you and
what kind of things you you might build
on from the previous education that you
want to bring here i think katya is an
excellent example of you know bringing
something completely different like
social sciences here
and then doing something interesting
with that
okay um
we are now ready to take your questions
and uh maybe you have been keeping track
of the questions and
can you pick some questions
okay i think the
first one over here is that will a
bachelor's degree in age uh hi
how do you say the acronym human
computer interaction how it will raise
my chances to get accepted income in
comparison to computer science degrees
so which kind of background do you
prefer anti
um
in comparison to to get accepted to to
what will a bachelor's degree
oh yeah you know hci is fine uh we would
like to have people who have some
computer science because much of our
teaching focuses on
on or uses computer science let's put it
like that so if you have a course on uh
minimum you should have something on
programming ideally something on like
algorithms and you know systems and so
on
um you know that's going to make your
life easier
that's not a hard requirement that that
would be beneficial to have
then there's a question
i will not be able to start a master
until november
2022 and the master starts in september
is this going to be a big problem if i
start late
um it will be a bit of a problem because
many of the orientations and first
things that they start in september and
then we have the first period
you know which is going to be quite
packed we for example have the user
research course then and many other ones
if uh teaching will be
organized in hybrid mode or remotely
then of course you know maybe you can
participate in part of those
but i i would recommend uh you know
coming in in september meet the other
students and myself
so i'm saying that it's possible to do
it in a way that you propose here so
starting in one america
you're certainly going to miss something
i would say that we our university has a
lot of orientation
when this study is sought to help you
find new friends and get to know
everything so in that sense it's also
valuable to be here but
but as undimensionally it's it's
partially possible to start remotely
and then
hi i am wondering how hci and biasing
data analysis can be related in
interactive data analysis can you
suggest some projects to check out later
the bayesian data analysis is working
with pretty arcane
tools you know building for example on r
and stan and things like that
and you know there's there's there's a
big need to develop a base in that data
analysis itself
uh to exploit uh interactive uh
interaction techniques and uh
interactive visualizations and so on and
that's something that uh
and other ones who are teaching the
bayesian data analysis for driving
classes of like 400 people that they're
keenly looking at and
we've been jointly supervising some some
massive students for example on those
topics
right now they don't have contact so if
you if you learn base and data analysis
you could learn about the theory and
sort of the programming aspects of
bayesian data analysis but if you wanted
to do something that connects hci you
know then it would be up to some sort of
interesting research project maybe or
and then we also have the danger the
info information visualization course
where you know some of those things
would come together and you would learn
some ways of plotting data in
interactive and powerful ways
so there will be some contact points but
uh but not a direct course at the
intersection of these things
okay
well then we already talked a bit about
taking part-time jobs so is there a
possibility to participate as a research
helper or something similar at all to
tackle to be rent
um i think auntie already mentioned that
yes it is possible but uh katya could
you tell about your experiences as
you told us you have have been working
yeah i've been working part-time like
during my residence permit i'm allowed
to work
25 hours a week but all my pos but all
of my positions were a bit a bit less
just to be able to manage my studies and
work well
um and i worked in a user interfaces lab
and i also was a teaching assistant
twice for different courses
as a research assistant
i was uh like i was helping uh people
from the lab
like with mostly with the things i like
to do like information visualization i
was doing a lot of graphs to support
like research but also it was an
excellent
opportunity to learn something new like
for example i worked with the results of
eye tracker studies which i have
very little connection to beforehand or
also like during the summer during my
summer position this year i worked with
the uc oakland who is
working on like a car model which can
simulate a driver and it was a very
fascinating topic like i know pretty
much nothing about cars but it was so
interesting to dive into this field i
like to do something once again with my
own hands
uh there so and there also i know that
there are a lot of opportunities to
work in different labs and then
different like courses and departments
so
sometimes it works this just you find a
person which interests you as a
professor and you can write them to ask
where the where they are hiring right
now
so yeah
thanks for your experiences
um then is there a chance to get
involved in hci projects before the
master start as jakadarenov mentioned if
yes where can i find those
so katya where did you find the
information and anti do you also have a
comment on this
well alta has a summer internship for
students
which i was part of it i think it is
yearly company so you can apply
some somewhere in the spring if i
remember correctly
yeah we every year we get the same same
questions and there are two things that
are happening there's the internship
programs by which we we get some some
students and get to know them there's
the us it's called husky
as all the school of science uh summer
internship program and we're part of
that so every year we publish some
projects and students come already in
like a june and they do that
they also paid positions by the way
and
the other thing is that then we have uh
aldo hci education teams channel so in
microsoft these teams application
there's a channel that is dedicated for
acs students
we publish our job uh positions you know
like tara positions there and also some
sometimes students just email me that
you know do you have anything and then
typically or often we have right and i
kind of guarantee that everybody gets
them but then we do have constant
you know look out for our asymptotes
thanks
then there are two questions by one
participant
first do you have specific classes about
accessibility
uh yes and no so unfortunately uh we we
did have something on the topic but
you know that that person left and the
course doesn't exist anymore
um but we do cover accessibility related
things on undedigated courses so for
example in the introduction to hci uh
there's something about it and then on
my course uh we talk about visual
perception models and we touch on
accessibility related things like
maybe color blindness or water
deficiency and stuff like that but it's
not systematically covered in our force
offerings unfortunately
we do have a strategic initiative at
alton university compost to make our
campus more accessible and there's
serious effort to do that
given that you know i'm not seeing that
so i'm not
not able to sort of um
to tell frankly how good it is right so
you have to turn to somebody else to get
a honest opinion on this
yeah that was maybe the second half of
the question that how do how does all
the create students with disability
so
inclusion is really important to us and
in in terms of our
facilities we try to make them as
accessible as possible and currently
they we are renovating the campus to
improve
in that sense and i think also our
studies
now making them remote for example is is
a part of that making them accessible
but
about that how studies are organized
maybe auntie do you want to comment that
part
well i mean
there's no shift toward uh hybrid and
then physical teaching
but some some some courses are still in
a remote mode that doesn't mean that
that's more accessible by the way so i
don't think aldo has yet
got as far as like offering uh closed
captioning subtitles to lectures and
things like that
but there's a strategy to improve in
that respect and i i think that those
people would be very willing to listen
to
suggestions
okay it was there's more specific that
uh the person is dyslexic person and has
some problems with spelling and reading
speed
well i mean if you made it as far as
getting a bachelor degree in a related
area then
most likely or
okay
i don't think there's any
anything more than that required
then let's find next question
the person is a software developer with
skillset in machine learning and data
science
i don't have any hci or design
background do i stand any chance to be
admitted if i apply yeah uh so this is
from uh maria so this is this is a good
good question and i i would strongly
recommend applying because we we have
many
students with a similar profile they run
you know doing something in machine
learning data science computer science
software development and then they
decided that okay i want to do something
more human-centric
and how this works in practice is that
then we ask you to take some basic
courses on we have in the very first
period we have introduction to hci you
know let's take that course right and
start building from that i think it's
really really healthy that you have a
technical core that you can build on
because some of the later courses will
be technically more involved on the
other hand if you have you know design
or hci background then you do need to
take some of the more technical courses
in the beginning so that you prep your
way uh to those
more challenging masters level courses
in
nci
and i think important over here is to
write your motivation on the
motivational letter why do you want to
change your career for example
auntie do you have a comment on this
yeah exactly i know we every year we
accept people who have no
aci background so please don't take that
as a requirement
it is beneficial if you've taken
something but you know believe me we
have pretty good offering in the
beginning of the semesters to
start learning that as well
okay then there's a uh question i
haven't completed my bachelor's degree
yet if i finish my degree in september
while following the lessons is a problem
um
i think one thing is to check the uh
general um admissions
instructions aldo has
i think
i can say that the diploma
should be
like in the admissions office before you
start the classes here
but the classes don't start immediately
in september so
yeah um i think the strict deadlines are
available
uh
you know on our website so you can
actually check that from there
so our admissions websites will answer
to your question
uh then um
what's the admission rate to hc
a
uh i can't recall the number i'm sorry
because
i'm actually in charge of the admission
and uh
and uh we got a i don't know maybe 100
applications and we offer something like
15
maybe that gives you an idea but you
know you should not look at the uh
acceptance rate per se right because we
did all you know all over the world we
get applications these days
and you should just focus on on making
an excellent application yourself
um
then i couldn't find any hci courses in
fitec course it's not sure if i missed
would really like to get some basics so
are we offering feeder courses like uh
not not in this major atmosphere yeah i
mean if you want to do something like
that in your specialization and combine
you know hci and feedback you know maybe
we can come up with something
i have not had a student before who
would like to do that
and we're open enough
yeah
then i have a background from university
of applied sciences are there any
special requirements or extra courses
needed to take for people not from
university background
yeah normally we would recommend some
more uh technical computer science
course for example we have excellent
course courses by uh lucas and their
customers are teaching the the basics of
computer science and not just
programming but computer science as a
science
and those would be quite quite
recommended
because you get certain basic concepts
there uh in terms of like how algorithms
work and so on that you can then apply
in
that that is somewhat required you know
when you for example apply optimization
or machine learning
um
in the way that we're doing in these
courses but you know it's um you know we
have had
students from you know university of
life sciences
uh and then we then direct them to take
some courses like that
okay i think we have time for a couple
of
more questions anything you wish to ask
from katya who is our student or
something else we still have few minutes
left
and thank you so far for that really
good questions
oh maria has a question
um
yeah the feeder is is open university
and um are there any open university
courses on on the topic
on the topic of fittech i don't know on
the topic of hci i also don't know
uh vtec is the organization but um i
think they
they might be a bit more general the
course is over there and not as special
as hei
yeah
yeah i i don't really know that
and then uh question uh what can you
tell us about the joint program with eit
digital for human computer interaction
yeah i can i can tell a lot about that
because i'm in charge of the exit year
on that program so it consists of two
years one
in one site in europe that's part of the
chain of universities like in paris or
stockholm
and the other one here
and i'm in charge of the the
specialization on computational uh hci
so you know very much similar things
that i just showed
uh typically you know you would start in
in september take a course in user
research and computational design and
then
starting in january you would do a
master's thesis here in helsinki with
the company typically but sometimes
with academic groups as well
we have some really good experiences
with ert students
they also you know it's quite intense
because you have to go to two sites but
then again you know get uh pretty uh
good networking uh out of that and you
get uh quite diverse experiences and
typically they land uh good job
positions and some of them go to do with
expositions as well
so i recommend also considering that one
it's a good program
if you are interested in the double
degree which the eit is uh kindly check
the admissions
period then or the application period
because it's a bit different than this
one we are talking
at the moment
so please
please be specific on that
um i think one more question we still
have time so
thanks so far about the questions and
anything else
and i i also want to welcome if you have
any questions just email me or on
uh we're happy to help
yeah and and you can also send questions
to admissions at all the dot fi so if
you have anything about the
how to apply so they also help you with
the technical side of applying to our
university
but if no further questions so thank you
so much for participating and good luck
with applying
and we hope to see you here in the
canvas
next fall
indeed we'll see you soon and thank you
for joining this session and
have a nice rest of the week thank you
