0.03,4.769,welcome to learn computer science
1.79,4.87,online.com and in this video we are
4.799,5.401,going to discuss what is a database
6.66,5.97,management system in simple terms the
10.2,5.729,database management system is a software
12.63,6.51,application used to create manage and
15.929,5.251,administer the databases the database
19.14,5.639,management system is commonly
21.18,5.4,abbreviated as DBMS some of the most
24.779,5.371,commonly used database management
26.58,6.3,systems include mysql oracle microsoft
30.15,5.64,SQL server and there are many such
32.88,5.88,popular DBMS software available in the
35.79,5.429,market in order to understand the
38.76,4.619,database management system we need to
41.219,5.551,first understand the meaning of terms
43.379,6.601,data and the database let us first
46.77,6.17,discuss what is data the data is the
49.98,5.88,most important element of any DBMS and
52.94,5.799,therefore it is important to understand
55.86,6.24,the meaning of term data the term data
58.739,7.441,in the context of DBMS indicates any
62.1,6.449,facts figures observations images or any
66.18,6.18,such similar things that can be recorded
68.549,6.511,and then digitally processed the data
72.36,4.799,must be recordable so that the raw data
75.06,4.47,can be processed with the help of a
77.159,5.611,computer system and the data processing
79.53,7.17,software let us consider one example of
82.77,6.86,data for a employee database the data
86.7,6.86,pertaining to an employee might include
89.63,8.169,name date of birth address designation
93.56,7.809,salary and so on let us now discuss the
97.799,6.091,meaning of term database the database in
101.369,4.801,simple terms is the organized collection
103.89,4.92,of interrelated data that can be
106.17,5.729,efficiently stored access to manipulated
108.81,5.07,the database offers many advantages and
111.899,5.491,the most efficient way of storing and
113.88,5.699,organizing the data the database is an
117.39,4.589,important element of most software
119.579,5.82,applications designed to store access
121.979,7.321,and process the data with the help of
125.399,6.781,any DBMS software application let us now
129.3,4.32,discuss what is a database management
132.18,4.32,system
133.62,5.07,the term DBMS stands for database
136.5,4.98,management system which is a software
138.69,5.939,designed to perform various database
141.48,6.18,operations the database operations
144.629,6.621,performed by the DBMS includes creating
147.66,6.81,new databases administering managing and
151.25,5.14,manipulating the databases the database
154.47,4.739,manipulation operations includes
156.39,5.129,creating new database modifying the
159.209,4.831,tables adding and deleting the data in
161.519,6.121,the table and other such user specified
164.04,6.809,database operations the DBMS internally
167.64,5.49,might consist of group of programs each
170.849,4.97,of these program performs a different
173.13,5.55,task related to the database management
175.819,6.041,some of the most commonly used DBMS
178.68,6.47,includes MySQL extensively used for web
181.86,6.42,applications oracle microsoft SQL server
185.15,8.71,IBM db2 Microsoft Access
188.28,7.5,mariya DB MongoDB Post get SQL and there
193.86,5.04,are many more DBMS available in the
195.78,5.67,market the DBMS also provides the
198.9,5.7,necessary tools required for the design
201.45,5.73,and the development of databases the
204.6,4.74,database management system is a vital
207.18,5.369,component of most of the software
209.34,4.979,applications whether you are working on
212.549,4.5,an enterprise software development
214.319,4.771,project or you may be developing a small
217.049,4.59,website the database design and
219.09,6.239,development skills are needed in almost
221.639,6.151,all software applications and therefore
225.329,5.731,the DBMS knowledge is important for
227.79,5.879,programmers and software developers the
231.06,5.429,database management system internally
233.669,6.54,makes use of database query language
236.489,7.411,such as SQL the SQL stands for
240.209,5.851,structured query language the SQL is
243.9,5.91,standard database query language
246.06,6.6,supported by almost all DBMS based on
249.81,5.69,the relational model it is a database
252.66,5.37,query language SQL used by the software
255.5,6.159,applications to communicate with the
258.03,6.12,database management system the DBMS in
261.659,4.98,turn communicates with the database and
264.15,4.889,performs the desired database operation
266.639,5.25,the database is managed by the DBMS
269.039,5.671,which actually stores the data the
271.889,5.131,software professionals with DBMS skills
274.71,5.37,are the highest paid professionals in
277.02,5.79,the job market that brings us to the end
280.08,4.829,of this tutorial and in this tutorial we
282.81,4.979,have discussed what is a database
284.909,5.19,management system if you have liked this
