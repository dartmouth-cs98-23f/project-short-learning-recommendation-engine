0.399,3.92,intelligence is an attribute associated
2.72,3.44,with humans
4.319,3.761,so when we try to mimic this
6.16,5.68,intelligence in a machine
8.08,6.559,we call this artificial intelligence
11.84,4.08,so by definition any method that mimics
14.639,4.72,human behavior
15.92,6.24,is known as artificial intelligence
19.359,4.401,the machines are programmed using code
22.16,4.32,and in coding we have
23.76,3.599,different methods such as if statements
26.48,4.32,while loops
27.359,6.081,for loops etc so using these methods
30.8,5.439,if we can replicate human behavior this
33.44,5.92,would be artificial intelligence
36.239,3.761,but it would not perform very well this
39.36,2.879,is because
40.0,3.44,this method is an explicit way of
42.239,3.521,programming
43.44,4.08,which means we are defining each and
45.76,5.68,every possible scenario
47.52,6.24,and what to do if that scenario occurs
51.44,4.0,if we take an example of a self-driving
53.76,3.92,car then this would mean
55.44,3.36,that we are defining each and every
57.68,3.199,possibility
58.8,3.439,that could happen on the road while
60.879,3.521,driving
62.239,3.441,like if there is a human in front we
64.4,3.52,have to stop
65.68,3.28,if there is water on the road we have to
67.92,3.519,slow down
68.96,3.839,and if the green light is on we should
71.439,3.441,drive
72.799,5.041,now these scenarios they sound very
74.88,6.239,simple if you look at them individually
77.84,4.24,but what if a human is in front the road
81.119,3.121,is wet
82.08,3.28,and the traffic light is green all at
84.24,4.16,the same time
85.36,5.68,what should you do then so in theory
88.4,4.88,there are infinite possible scenarios so
91.04,4.48,writing all of these scenarios would not
93.28,4.24,be possible
95.52,3.12,so here comes machine learning to the
97.52,3.04,rescue
98.64,3.6,now machine learning is a part of
100.56,3.68,artificial intelligence
102.24,3.28,but the main difference here is that it
104.24,4.239,is not based on
105.52,5.36,explicit programming this means that
108.479,6.161,instead of us defining the rules
110.88,6.559,the machine itself will learn the rules
114.64,4.0,let's take an example let's say we want
117.439,4.64,the machine to learn
118.64,5.2,the difference between cats and dogs
122.079,3.521,in this case we will define some
123.84,4.24,features of the cat
125.6,3.439,and some features of the dog that
128.08,3.36,separates them
129.039,3.2,from each other now this feature
131.44,3.439,definition
132.239,3.441,is happening in numbers rather than just
134.879,3.921,saying
135.68,5.68,dogs have bigger ears than cats
138.8,3.2,so based on these features the machine
141.36,3.36,is able
142.0,3.04,to learn the difference between a cat
144.72,4.08,and
145.04,5.76,a dog now this is known as a
148.8,3.76,classification problem
150.8,4.32,where we have a limited number of
152.56,6.08,classes and we need to sort out
155.12,5.759,new data into one of these classes
158.64,3.84,the other main type of problem is the
160.879,4.161,regression problem
162.48,3.039,where we have a continuous number rather
165.04,4.08,than
165.519,4.561,limited classifications so let's take an
169.12,4.479,example of
170.08,5.36,real estate let's say we want to know
173.599,5.201,the price of a house
175.44,6.719,based on its location number of beds and
178.8,6.96,the size in square feet so these three
182.159,5.681,values are basically our features
185.76,3.28,so we will give the machine some
187.84,3.6,previous data
189.04,3.04,where we know the location number of
191.44,3.92,beds
192.08,4.72,the size and the price so once the
195.36,3.519,machine trains itself
196.8,4.159,it would be able to give an estimate
198.879,3.841,price of the new house
200.959,3.36,given the location the number of
202.72,4.799,bedrooms the size
204.319,5.121,in square feet is provided note that the
207.519,6.08,price here is a continuous number
209.44,6.56,like 352 000.
213.599,3.041,if this was a classification problem the
216.0,4.159,classes
216.64,7.28,of the price would be low medium
220.159,5.201,or high so the two major types of
223.92,5.679,machine learning problems
225.36,4.239,are classification and regression
229.84,4.479,but even with the machine learning the
231.84,4.479,process is not fully intelligent
234.319,3.441,as humans are the ones that are
236.319,4.801,providing features
237.76,6.0,in order for it to learn in the case of
241.12,4.88,the cat and dog classification we had to
243.76,5.36,define the features of a cat
246.0,5.28,and features of a dog so
249.12,3.759,now comes the deep learning to the
251.28,3.679,rescue
252.879,3.2,deep learning is a subset of machine
254.959,3.601,learning
256.079,3.84,the idea of deep learning is inspired by
258.56,4.88,the human brain
259.919,6.321,that consists of billions of neurons
263.44,4.64,based on these neuron architecture we
266.24,5.2,create an artificial neural
268.08,4.559,network and when this neural network has
271.44,4.4,multiple layers
272.639,3.761,we call it deep neural network hence the
275.84,4.079,term
276.4,6.16,deep learning so here the idea is that
279.919,3.441,we just show the machine different
282.56,3.919,images of
283.36,3.76,cats and dogs and it finds the relevant
286.479,3.921,features
287.12,5.84,that separate them by itself and trains
290.4,4.0,itself to differentiate between cats and
292.96,3.84,dogs
294.4,3.6,this method is closest method to the
296.8,3.119,human intelligence
298.0,3.28,and therefore has shown promising
299.919,5.601,results in many
301.28,4.639,different fields let's take the example
305.52,2.72,of
305.919,4.481,a self-driving car for understanding
308.24,4.88,this further
310.4,3.359,as humans we just see the surroundings
313.12,3.359,from our
313.759,4.16,eyes and based on that we decide on
316.479,5.201,whether to break
317.919,3.761,accelerate or steer the car
322.08,4.64,now this we learn over the years by
324.4,4.56,observing and practicing
326.72,4.24,in our head we are not calculating
328.96,4.32,actual values
330.96,3.28,the same way we can collect images from
333.28,2.88,a camera
334.24,6.16,and record the stating angle
336.16,4.24,acceleration and the breaking values
340.72,4.8,and then we can use this data to train
343.199,4.72,our machine
345.52,3.36,now when a new image is shown to the
347.919,3.361,machine
348.88,3.599,it will decide by itself how much to
351.28,4.4,accelerate
352.479,5.601,brake and steer note that
355.68,3.12,in this example we did not define any
358.08,3.44,features
358.8,4.88,such as road lanes pumps or even
361.52,4.799,obstacles
363.68,6.48,it observed and learned by itself which
366.319,6.0,features are relevant for driving
370.16,5.28,this is how most big companies are
372.319,5.44,approaching the self-driving problem
375.44,4.16,in fact nvidia even shared their
377.759,4.961,self-driving ai model
379.6,4.08,and their results they were able to
382.72,3.12,drive a car
383.68,3.28,using this method by just training the
385.84,5.359,model with
386.96,4.239,72 hours of driving data
392.24,6.399,so in summary ai is mimicking
395.36,6.48,human behavior by any means whereas
398.639,4.161,machine learning is a subset of ai that
401.84,3.76,does not use
402.8,5.28,explicit programming that means that it
405.6,3.28,is not using any fixed rules but
408.08,4.8,requires
408.88,4.64,features from humans deep learning is a
412.88,2.96,subset
413.52,4.399,of machine learning that does not
415.84,5.04,require any feature definition
417.919,3.521,from humans it is able to decide by
420.88,3.36,itself
421.44,6.4,which features are relevant and train
424.24,3.6,itself on the given data
428.639,3.201,there are two main categories of
430.639,3.68,problems
431.84,4.16,one is the classification problem where
434.319,5.28,the result is a limited number
436.0,6.4,of classes for example cat and dog
439.599,3.841,the other one is the regression problem
442.4,4.079,where the result
443.44,6.96,is a continuous number for example price
446.479,6.56,of a house
450.4,3.359,so this was introduction to artificial
453.039,3.201,intelligence
453.759,4.88,machine learning and deep learning in
456.24,3.04,the upcoming videos we will explore each
458.639,3.28,of these
459.28,3.84,in detail and we will look at the
461.919,4.481,practical examples
463.12,3.919,including their coding so if you like
466.4,2.799,the video
467.039,12.801,give it a thumbs up and i will see you
469.199,10.641,in the next one
484.24,2.079,you
