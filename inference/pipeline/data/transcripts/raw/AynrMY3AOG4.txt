0.24,4.32,whether you have an interest in a 3d
2.0,4.48,field or you are already a 3d artist the
4.56,3.76,new work probably consists of a lot of
6.48,3.84,3d modeling today i'm going to share
8.32,4.16,with you a simple guide that will help
10.32,4.16,you understand what jobs need your 3d
12.48,5.44,modeling skills in different fields that
14.48,3.44,use 3d software
18.8,4.8,3d character modeling is a very in
20.56,4.799,demand job on the market because studios
23.6,3.999,or small companies that either work in
25.359,4.561,video game development or in the movie
27.599,4.721,and animation industries heavily focus
29.92,4.319,on characters visuals knowing that it is
32.32,4.0,one of the main elements that attracts
34.239,4.48,players or viewers attention to keep
36.32,3.84,them engaged and interested
38.719,3.52,this is actually one of the most
40.16,4.8,important and one of the most in demand
42.239,5.201,jobs and to be honest the competition in
44.96,4.64,this field is fierce because there are a
47.44,4.56,lot of talented artists but this should
49.6,5.279,not sway you from pursuing this if this
52.0,2.879,is what you want to do
56.0,3.76,environment art is one of the favorite
57.84,3.84,3d jobs that i personally find
59.76,4.0,interesting because it is just
61.68,3.839,entertaining and pleasing to be part of
63.76,3.84,as an environment artist you'll be
65.519,3.28,working closely with level designers
67.6,3.12,meaning that you will be taking a
68.799,4.32,leading role in shaping up the level or
70.72,4.48,sequence the studio is gonna create for
73.119,4.401,outdoor settings background art and
75.2,4.16,visuals for movies and video games
77.52,3.84,basically we'll be creating worlds
79.36,4.72,people will experience which is great to
81.36,2.72,say the least
85.2,4.32,3d asset modeling is also one of the
87.119,4.081,most popular 3d modeling jobs out there
89.52,4.48,this type of artists take off
91.2,5.2,freelancing jobs or work as contractors
94.0,4.88,and even full-time in studios because
96.4,5.039,creating 3d assets is considered a
98.88,4.32,complementary yet a very necessary role
101.439,4.32,for all projects no matter what your
103.2,4.559,field is they are tasked to create a
105.759,5.121,wide range of elements and objects such
107.759,4.881,as weapons vehicles furniture and so on
110.88,5.84,basically they create all the props for
112.64,4.08,video games movies and animations
118.0,4.719,this is quite a fun job for those
119.68,5.36,interested as 3d artists or specifically
122.719,4.72,visualization artists work closely with
125.04,4.24,architects meaning that artists will be
127.439,4.001,interpreting the blueprints and designs
129.28,4.24,of construction in addition to houses
131.44,4.32,and interior designs and try to bring
133.52,4.48,the architect's idea to life all for the
135.76,4.479,sake of tackling simplifying and
138.0,6.239,visualizing plans to the clients prior
140.239,4.0,to the actual execution and construction
145.28,4.88,3d printing is relatively a new field
148.0,4.8,but surprisingly it is a growing
150.16,4.32,industry as 3d printing companies are
152.8,3.84,everywhere to offer a variety of
154.48,4.56,printing services for clients what is
156.64,4.72,the task of 3d modeler you might ask
159.04,4.72,well these companies recruit 3d modelers
161.36,4.48,to create 3d models and sort of maneuver
163.76,5.04,the printers by adjusting and optimizing
165.84,5.2,3d products and objects for the machines
168.8,4.719,and deliver great 3d printed projects at
171.04,2.479,the end
174.56,4.0,graphic design has also been a heavily
176.879,3.841,in-demand profession and the
178.56,4.56,implementation of 3d in it is becoming
180.72,4.56,more intensive graphic design companies
183.12,4.56,are frankly all over the place which
185.28,4.08,increase the need for 3d modelers three
187.68,3.68,artists often create different kinds of
189.36,3.92,models and create animations for
191.36,3.84,companies and clients to bring their
193.28,4.16,vision to life and help them achieve
195.2,4.319,their goals so if you want to be a 3d
197.44,5.04,designer it is probably a good time to
199.519,2.961,do so right now
203.36,5.12,even though this is a big industry it is
205.68,4.8,not a very obvious one that they use 3d
208.48,4.08,and it must be mentioned on this list
210.48,4.16,think about the number of big design and
212.56,4.399,production companies or even the local
214.64,3.92,ones in your city this is exactly why
216.959,4.481,you probably should be considering this
218.56,4.959,job simply for the availability of it
221.44,3.68,the product or the industrial designer
223.519,4.241,will be working closely with the product
225.12,4.24,manager to model or render out a perfect
227.76,4.399,version of the actual product for
229.36,4.959,automotive companies prosthetics toys
232.159,5.601,different utility products or anything
234.319,3.441,else that you can see around you
238.64,3.84,lastly you can work as an online
240.239,4.72,educator because with a huge number of
242.48,4.399,3d enthusiasts online you can easily
244.959,4.64,find an audience to teach if you have
246.879,4.801,enough experience with 3d software a 3d
