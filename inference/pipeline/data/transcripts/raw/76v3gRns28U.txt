6.919,6.401,welcome back algebra is one of the broad
10.5,5.58,areas of mathematics we would have come
13.32,5.1,across various algebra branches let's
16.08,4.8,take abstract algebra where the abstract
18.42,5.64,algebra is to study the algebraic
20.88,5.159,structures such as groups Rings fields
24.06,3.959,and abstract algebra has its wide
26.039,4.861,application area in the field of
28.019,5.281,cryptography coming to linear algebra
30.9,5.22,linear algebra deals with the linear
33.3,4.56,equations linear mappings and is used in
36.12,4.619,the application area like the weather
37.86,4.92,forecasting coming to Boolean algebra
40.739,4.14,these Boolean algebra deals with the
42.78,5.16,variables that are with the truth values
44.879,5.34,true or false and Boolean algebra has
47.94,4.619,its widespread applications in the areas
50.219,5.101,of digital circuitry designed in
52.559,5.52,personal computers pocket calculators CD
55.32,5.34,players cell phones and other electronic
58.079,4.441,products one such algebra that we are
60.66,5.04,going to focus in today's presentation
62.52,5.22,is the relational algebra and in today's
65.7,5.52,presentation we are going to focus on
67.74,5.76,the basics of relational algebra while
71.22,4.56,waiting let's step into the topic of the
73.5,4.619,day the relational algebra and
75.78,4.56,relational algebra is basically a
78.119,4.561,procedural query language what do we
80.34,5.4,mean by this it means we need to
82.68,4.86,instruct what to do how to do we are
85.74,4.14,expecting the result from the database
87.54,4.5,and the result is going to be a table or
89.88,4.8,a relation and in order to get that
92.04,5.46,result the table or the relation we need
94.68,5.34,to instruct what is required and how to
97.5,4.619,retrieve that data or how to retrieve
100.02,4.739,the result and that is why we refer
102.119,4.561,relational algebra as a procedural query
104.759,4.021,language if you are directly watching
106.68,4.74,this lecture I request you to navigate
108.78,4.979,to chapter 1 of this playlist and find
111.42,3.9,the lecture database languages where I
113.759,3.841,have explained about the database
115.32,4.32,languages the procedural query language
117.6,4.5,and the non-procedural query language
119.64,5.7,with examples for now just understand
122.1,5.339,relational algebra is a procedural query
125.34,5.52,language and what it actually does
127.439,6.121,basically a relational algebra is a set
130.86,4.98,of operations on relations this is like
133.56,4.319,the normal algebraic operation where
135.84,4.56,it's going to take input and it's going
137.879,5.461,to produce the output likewise here also
140.4,5.64,relational algebra is basically a set of
143.34,4.8,operations on relations so it's going to
146.04,4.32,work on the relation and does the
148.14,4.38,operation and gives the result as a
150.36,4.86,relation only and that's why we say
152.52,5.76,relational algebra is basically a set of
155.22,6.0,operations and to be precise it is like
158.28,4.8,a set of algebraic operations these
161.22,4.2,algebraic operations like the addition
163.08,4.68,subtraction all these take some values
165.42,4.679,as the input and does the operation and
167.76,3.839,produces the output likewise here also
170.099,4.081,relational algebra is going to take
171.599,5.22,relations as input does the operation
174.18,4.8,and generates the output which is also a
176.819,4.5,relation in simple terms relational
178.98,4.74,algebra is a set of operations which
181.319,5.101,takes one or more relations as input and
183.72,4.44,produces a relation as an output so so
186.42,3.84,that's what the next Point says the
188.16,4.68,input is going to be one or more
190.26,5.399,relations and the output is going to be
192.84,4.92,a relation and why one or more relations
195.659,4.021,there are certain relational algebra
197.76,4.259,operators which are unary operators
199.68,3.96,where it takes only one relation as an
202.019,4.08,input there are certain relational
203.64,5.519,algebra operators with takes two or more
206.099,5.821,inputs so they are binary or ternary so
209.159,4.921,what I mean to say is in a nutshell it
211.92,4.38,takes one or more relations as an input
214.08,4.56,and produces another relation as an
216.3,5.46,output and why do we need to study this
218.64,4.98,relational algebra because it provides a
221.76,3.839,theoretical foundation for relational
223.62,3.72,databases we know the power of
225.599,3.78,relational databases in this
227.34,4.14,contemporary world when we want to work
229.379,3.901,on the relational database or when we
231.48,3.479,want to know the foundations of the
233.28,4.019,relational database it's always
234.959,5.461,recommended to have a sound knowledge on
237.299,5.041,relational algebra because it provides a
240.42,4.98,theoretical foundation for the
242.34,4.979,relational databases the well-known dbms
245.4,4.02,language that is widely used in today's
247.319,4.321,world is the structured query language
249.42,4.56,SQL and when you want to become
251.64,4.26,proficient with SQL knowing relational
253.98,4.8,algebra will give an additional
255.9,4.2,advantage and not only that when we have
258.78,4.32,a sound knowledge in the relational
260.1,5.22,algebra obviously it allows us to
263.1,5.46,understand database operations in more
265.32,5.939,detail and also it motivates us to write
268.56,4.68,optimized queries we know databases are
271.259,4.141,going to respond to queries when we
273.24,4.8,Supply a query to the database database
275.4,5.04,accepts the query does the operation and
278.04,5.4,gives the result if we want to get that
280.44,4.92,output there may be multiple ways if we
283.44,4.08,want an output from the database I mean
285.36,4.32,a relation or a table there can be
287.52,4.38,multiple queries where these queries
289.68,4.44,gives the same output but giving an
291.9,4.5,optimized query is always good because
294.12,5.519,your databases will not take more time
296.4,5.4,or more memory to execute that query so
299.639,4.441,what I mean to say is instead of giving
301.8,4.5,a query to the database if we give an
304.08,5.04,optimized query the database will
306.3,5.04,respond easily because this optimized
309.12,4.32,queries will be having lower cost cost
311.34,4.56,is one of the factors that are used to
313.44,4.979,measure the query optimization in simple
315.9,5.4,terms relational algebra helps us to
318.419,4.441,write optimized queries and also it
321.3,3.54,helps us to understand the database
322.86,3.96,operations in more detail what's
324.84,4.32,happening at the back end how queries
326.82,4.98,are processed how query execution plans
329.16,4.86,are generated how the plans are executed
331.8,3.959,all these things no worries in the
334.02,3.899,coming lectures we are going to focus on
335.759,3.961,query optimization techniques at the
337.919,4.021,time I will explain you how query
339.72,5.1,optimization is actually taken care by
341.94,5.22,database we are done with the basics of
344.82,4.5,relational algebra before we move on to
347.16,4.68,the next slide just revisit what is
349.32,4.74,relational algebra it is a set of
351.84,4.5,operations what are the operations that
354.06,4.56,relational algebra contains that's what
356.34,4.199,we are going to see now basically the
358.62,4.139,relational algebra operations are
360.539,4.5,classified into two categories number
362.759,3.901,one the fundamental operations and
365.039,3.901,number two the additional operations
366.66,4.319,let's just focus on the names of the
368.94,4.38,operations in this lecture in the coming
370.979,5.16,lectures we are going to focus on all
373.32,5.34,the operations one by one in detail with
376.139,4.981,required examples for now let's just
378.66,4.8,know the operation names talking about
381.12,4.199,the fundamental operations there are six
383.46,4.019,fundamental operations as far as
385.319,4.141,relational algebra is concerned the
387.479,4.681,first operation is select the second
389.46,4.92,operation is Project the third one is
392.16,4.5,Union the fourth one is the set
394.38,4.2,difference fifth one is the Cartesian
396.66,4.14,product and the last fundamental
398.58,4.739,operation in relational algebra the
400.8,5.459,sixth one is the rename operation
403.319,5.82,these six operations are the fundamental
406.259,5.101,operations in relational algebra and
409.139,4.261,coming to the additional operations we
411.36,4.5,have various additional operations in
413.4,4.68,relational algebra they are the set
415.86,5.58,intersection operation the assignment
418.08,4.98,operation the inner join where in inner
421.44,4.02,joint we are going to focus on the
423.06,4.8,natural join equi join and Theta join
425.46,4.739,but our emphasis in this subject will be
427.86,4.02,more on natural joint and the next
430.199,3.661,additional operation is the division
431.88,3.659,operation and the last additional
433.86,4.619,operation that we are going to focus on
435.539,4.741,in this subject is the outer join where
438.479,4.741,we are going to see three forms of Auto
440.28,6.24,join the left outer join the right outer
443.22,5.64,join and the full outer join so we have
446.52,4.44,seen about the various fundamental and
448.86,4.2,additional operations in the coming
450.96,4.44,lectures we are going to focus on all
453.06,4.74,the operations one by one with examples
455.4,4.62,and that's it guys I hope you guys
457.8,3.82,enjoyed this presentation and thank you
