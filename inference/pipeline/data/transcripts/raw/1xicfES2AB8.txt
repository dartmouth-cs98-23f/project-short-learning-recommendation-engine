second,duration,transcript
2.149,7.391,okay so this is an introduction into
5.069,6.751,database systems we're gonna go over
9.54,3.179,some terminology on on what is a
11.82,3.149,database
12.719,6.15,well what do we need it for why is it
14.969,6.9,important now data are facts that are
18.869,4.531,recorded and can be accessed now there's
21.869,4.021,different data formats
23.4,6.0,you know there's text numbers figures
25.89,6.209,graphics of data images audio video
29.4,5.429,recordings of data and more really
32.099,4.741,really everything is this data and some
34.829,5.181,type of format you know you can have
36.84,6.66,your bank account you know there's data
40.01,5.74,for your bank account there's you know
43.5,4.2,an excel sheet there's data inside it
45.75,3.51,you know when you're you know there's
47.7,4.379,just so many different examples and
49.26,7.38,indeed ORS recorded and kept because is
52.079,7.041,considered to be you to be abuse to an
56.64,5.28,intended user so you know if you're
59.12,5.23,collecting data for a job and then you
61.92,5.4,have to present that information you
64.35,5.67,keep it because it you know your
67.32,4.229,intended user is a client or you know
70.02,5.37,whatever your you're presenting the data
71.549,5.941,for now information refers to the data
75.39,3.36,that is accessed by a user for some
77.49,3.809,particular purpose
78.75,5.009,so typically typically getting the
81.299,5.341,needed information from a collection of
83.759,5.72,data requires performing an activity so
86.64,6.0,for example you have a bunch of numbers
89.479,6.971,you know and you need those numbers to
92.64,5.64,be turned into information you know and
96.45,3.57,so just searching through processing or
98.28,6.06,manipulating the data in some sort of
100.02,6.629,some sort of fashion now we have
104.34,4.77,metadata now what is metadata that's
106.649,4.65,data that describes the structure and
109.11,3.869,the properties of the data you know
111.299,4.471,metadata is essential for the proper
112.979,4.831,understanding and use of the data so you
115.77,3.72,know you have your metadata and then you
117.81,3.809,have your data you know metadata is a
119.49,5.729,collection of a bunch of different
121.619,6.81,information or excuse me data and you
125.219,6.171,turn that into data you know to be able
128.429,2.961,to turn into information
131.89,6.34,now data without metadata now this is an
136.22,6.45,example is you know what is this telling
138.23,9.03,us you know we have 0 0 0 1 b2 and then
142.67,12.29,you know 1101 now we can assume you know
147.26,7.7,that 1101 right here we highlight this
155.65,6.82,now we can assume right here that this
159.62,6.66,is time but we don't know that though
162.47,5.82,you know it's in the format of time but
166.28,3.78,without you know the metadata you know
168.29,4.41,we're not gonna know what this is you
170.06,4.95,know an example of this also you know
172.7,5.79,this can be some type of identification
175.01,5.76,number could be an ID number that's you
178.49,5.49,know referencing a product you know
180.77,5.67,let's say the product is B and this
183.98,7.35,could be the number of those products or
186.44,6.84,how many were sold at this time but we
191.33,6.69,really don't know that we don't know
193.28,7.17,what this information is you know and
198.02,6.81,with metadata you know you're gonna be
200.45,6.9,able to see that this is a transaction
204.83,5.01,ID from the previous slide so now we
207.35,5.01,know what this is you know the data
209.84,4.68,before just was just a bunch of numbers
212.36,4.65,and characters and letters but we don't
214.52,4.95,really know what it was though you know
217.01,6.02,metadata is gonna show us that this is a
219.47,6.5,transaction ID this is a product you
223.03,5.62,know this is the amount of items sold
225.97,4.63,and on the previous ayat we previous
228.65,7.74,slide we assumed that it was time but it
230.6,8.58,is time you know 1101 so metadata is
236.39,5.819,going to give us the information on how
239.18,5.24,to interpret the data and this is the
242.209,2.211,data
250.02,9.309,this is the excuse me for my bad
255.1,7.05,handwriting but this is the data and the
259.329,9.751,metadata helps it helps us determine
262.15,9.18,what the data is okay now what is a
269.08,5.07,database database is a structured
271.33,5.93,collection of related data stored on a
274.15,5.19,computer medium now the database
277.26,3.94,organizes the data in a way that
279.34,3.81,facilitates efficient access to the
281.2,5.01,information capturing the data so
283.15,4.86,database think of it like a like a trash
286.21,4.38,can you know all the information is
288.01,5.31,stored in there and it's gonna help us
290.59,5.84,be able to pick out the information that
293.32,5.4,we need and a database metadata
296.43,5.32,represents the structure of the database
298.72,6.6,so a database content that that is not
301.75,5.19,the data itself the data about data you
305.32,4.29,know it could contain names of data
306.94,4.2,structures data types data descriptions
309.61,6.51,other information describing the
311.14,6.89,kerrick's of the data you know on a
316.12,5.91,database management system or
318.03,8.92,abbreviated DBMS is a software used for
322.03,6.63,now a DBMS could be you know access or
326.95,4.68,Oracle or a bunch of other type of
328.66,4.85,actual database management systems and
331.63,4.98,reduce for the creation of databases
333.51,7.3,insertion storage retrieval update and
336.61,6.57,deletion of the data in the database now
340.81,4.65,a database system is a computer based
343.18,4.71,system whose purpose is to enable an
345.46,4.32,efficient interaction between the user
347.89,3.99,and the information captured in the
349.78,5.04,database so a good example again is
351.88,8.43,access Microsoft Access was for most of
354.82,14.43,us are familiar with now this is a good
360.31,12.03,example of a database okay now this is
369.25,4.35,the core you notice the databases where
372.34,4.47,all the information is stored in a
373.6,5.37,database management system can be access
376.81,4.079,you know Microsoft Access let's just
378.97,7.939,assume that this is Microsoft acts
380.889,9.481,yes okay and made for Microsoft Access
386.909,5.41,now think of this as Microsoft Access in
390.37,7.47,the database is all the information
392.319,8.31,inside Microsoft Access you know and you
397.84,7.129,have your front-end application you know
400.629,10.32,this can be the user know this is you
404.969,14.111,accessing Microsoft Access to access the
410.949,9.81,information which is the database okay
419.08,3.75,and what is a what does a front-end
420.759,3.84,application you know provides a
422.83,3.78,mechanism for easy interaction between
424.599,6.72,the user and the database management
426.61,7.23,system and the end user which is the
431.319,5.761,users using a database system to support
433.84,4.799,their tasks and processes now in direct
437.08,3.48,interaction is the end user
438.639,5.43,communicating with the database through
440.56,5.009,front-end applications and then direct
444.069,3.63,interaction is the end user
445.569,5.991,communicating with the database directly
447.699,3.861,through the database management system
454.56,10.599,here's an example okay this is say this
460.9,7.68,is you you know you're a programmer or
465.159,6.51,you're the database administrator and
468.58,6.389,you're directly accessing the database
471.669,4.5,management system okay now let's say
474.969,4.081,you're not a programmer you're just an
476.169,5.37,employee and you use a front-end
479.05,5.789,application which could be you know you
481.539,5.4,can create that in the access itself to
484.839,6.57,be able to access the database
486.939,9.48,management system now this is a good
491.409,7.32,example if you are an employee you know
496.419,5.701,at a you know let's say a fortune 500
498.729,6.24,company the company's not gonna want you
502.12,5.219,to be able to have direct access to the
504.969,4.801,database to be able to manipulate the
507.339,5.461,data inside the database management
509.77,4.59,system so they deploy a front-end
512.8,5.5,application
514.36,6.52,to where you can only collect or you
518.3,4.619,know retrieve information from the
520.88,5.1,database management system but you can't
522.919,9.481,manipulate the data inside the database
525.98,9.09,management system now steps and
532.4,5.1,development of a database system now you
535.07,4.59,have your database requirements know
537.5,4.86,what what are you needing you know you
539.66,5.1,need to collect the information define
542.36,5.61,you don't visualize so this is the
544.76,5.46,starting process of you know think of
547.97,5.27,like a building your own business and
550.22,5.31,this is a business plan what do you need
553.24,5.62,okay and then you need to model the
555.53,5.37,database to start to model it you know
558.86,3.87,create it right on a piece of paper you
560.9,4.32,know from there you go to the
562.73,4.17,implementation stage where you start to
565.22,3.51,build it you know and you're also
566.9,3.87,developing you know front-end
568.73,4.38,applications for indirect access which
570.77,4.05,could be for the employee you don't want
573.11,2.99,them to have direct access you just want
574.82,3.33,them to be able to retrieve information
576.1,7.42,that's what developing front-end
578.15,6.42,applications is now then you start to
583.52,3.3,have the deployment
584.57,5.61,you know deployment sages were it
586.82,5.55,becomes live you're deploying it now
590.18,4.41,from there you have the database use
592.37,6.18,which now you have your indirect or
594.59,6.99,direct use which could be you know the
598.55,4.71,employee accessing it or the you know
601.58,3.21,the administrator accessing you have
603.26,3.48,your database administration and
604.79,3.84,maintenance so this is gonna be your
606.74,4.5,your database management you know
608.63,8.73,programmer or associate or some of
611.24,8.46,that's gonna maintain the database now
617.36,4.77,requirements collections definition and
619.7,4.83,visual visualization now is the results
622.13,4.74,in the requirements specifying which
624.53,5.76,data that future database system will
626.87,5.19,hold and in what fashion so know what
630.29,3.39,are we creating is essentially what it's
632.06,4.08,saying and what the capabilities and
633.68,4.35,functionalities of the database system
636.14,3.33,will be you know the collector
638.03,3.81,requirement should be clearly defined
639.47,4.47,and stated in a read and document and
641.84,3.87,then visualized so you're you're
643.94,10.56,creating something from not
645.71,11.76,think okay in the conceptual database
654.5,5.67,model no a visualization of requirements
657.47,5.01,by using a conceptual data modeling
660.17,10.68,technique such as an entry relationship
662.48,10.94,diagram or ER diagram okay
670.85,2.57,now this
