0.16,4.4,ever wondered how google translates an
2.399,4.321,entire web page to a different language
4.56,4.4,in a matter of seconds or your phone
6.72,4.72,gallery group's images based on their
8.96,5.759,location all of this is a product of
11.44,5.36,deep learning but what exactly is deep
14.719,4.161,learning deep learning is a subset of
16.8,4.319,machine learning which in turn is a
18.88,4.319,subset of artificial intelligence
21.119,4.481,artificial intelligence is a technique
23.199,4.881,that enables a machine to mimic human
25.6,5.12,behavior machine learning is a technique
28.08,5.68,to achieve ai through algorithms trained
30.72,5.44,with data and finally deep learning is a
33.76,4.72,type of machine learning inspired by the
36.16,4.48,structure of the human brain in terms of
38.48,4.64,deep learning this structure is called
40.64,4.72,an artificial neural network let's
43.12,4.56,understand deep learning better and how
45.36,3.679,it's different from machine learning say
47.68,3.359,we create a machine that could
49.039,4.641,differentiate between tomatoes and
51.039,4.081,cherries if done using machine learning
53.68,3.68,we'd have to tell the machine the
55.12,4.64,features based on which the two can be
57.36,4.879,differentiated these features could be
59.76,4.719,the size and the type of stim on them
62.239,4.081,with deep learning on the other hand the
64.479,4.32,features are picked out by the neural
66.32,4.72,network without human intervention of
68.799,4.0,course that kind of independence comes
71.04,4.399,at the cost of having a much higher
72.799,4.881,volume of data to train our machine
75.439,3.761,now let's dive into the working of
77.68,4.0,neural networks
79.2,4.72,here we have three students each of them
81.68,3.2,write down the digit 9 on a piece of
83.92,2.8,paper
84.88,4.4,notably they don't all write it
86.72,4.48,identically the human brain can easily
89.28,4.32,recognize the digits
91.2,3.44,but what if a computer had to recognize
93.6,3.44,them
94.64,4.08,that's where deep learning comes in
97.04,4.0,here's a neural network trained to
98.72,5.039,identify handwritten digits
101.04,4.56,each number is present as an image of 28
103.759,5.121,times 28 pixels
105.6,4.32,now that amounts to a total of 784
108.88,3.36,pixels
109.92,4.08,neurons the core entity of a neural
112.24,3.68,network is where the information
114.0,5.119,processing takes place
115.92,5.28,each of the 784 pixels is fed to a
119.119,3.121,neuron in the first layer of our neural
121.2,3.519,network
122.24,4.64,this forms the input layer
124.719,4.4,on the other end we have the output
126.88,4.24,layer with each neuron representing a
129.119,3.2,digit with the hidden layers existing
131.12,3.28,between them
132.319,4.081,the information is transferred from one
134.4,3.04,layer to another over connecting
136.4,3.6,channels
137.44,5.2,each of these has a value attached to it
140.0,4.48,and hence is called a weighted channel
142.64,4.64,all neurons have a unique number
144.48,4.96,associated with it called bias
147.28,4.64,this bias is added to the weighted sum
149.44,4.48,of inputs reaching the neuron
151.92,4.959,which is then applied to a function
153.92,5.2,known as the activation function
156.879,4.881,the result of the activation function
159.12,5.04,determines if the neuron gets activated
161.76,4.96,every activated neuron passes on
164.16,4.88,information to the following layers
166.72,5.36,this continues until the second last
169.04,5.52,layer the one neuron activated in the
172.08,4.799,output layer corresponds to the input
174.56,4.399,digit the weights and bias are
176.879,4.801,continuously adjusted to produce a
178.959,5.36,well-trained network so where is deep
181.68,4.479,learning applied in customer support
184.319,5.041,when most people converse with customer
186.159,5.281,support agents the conversation seems so
189.36,4.56,real they don't even realize that it's
191.44,4.64,actually a bot on the other side in
193.92,5.12,medical care neural networks detect
196.08,6.64,cancer cells and analyze mri images to
199.04,6.559,give detailed results self-driving cars
202.72,6.32,what seem like science fiction is now a
205.599,5.121,reality apple tesla and nissan are only
209.04,4.72,a few of the companies working on
210.72,5.92,self-driving cars so deep learning has a
213.76,5.44,vast scope but it too faces some
216.64,5.519,limitations the first as we discussed
219.2,4.8,earlier is data while deep learning is
222.159,4.08,the most efficient way to deal with
224.0,4.4,unstructured data a neural network
226.239,4.881,requires a massive volume of data to
228.4,4.72,train let's assume we always have access
231.12,4.0,to the necessary amount of data
233.12,5.119,processing this is not within the
235.12,5.399,capability of every machine and that
238.239,4.881,brings us to our second limitation
240.519,5.241,computational power training in neural
243.12,5.44,network requires graphical processing
245.76,6.96,units which have thousands of cores as
248.56,7.12,compared to cpus and gpus are of course
252.72,5.759,more expensive and finally we come down
255.68,5.76,to training time deep neural networks
258.479,5.44,take hours or even months to train the
261.44,5.36,time increases with the amount of data
263.919,5.441,and number of layers in the network so
266.8,4.399,here's a short quiz for you arrange the
269.36,4.32,following statements in order to
271.199,6.081,describe the working of a neural network
273.68,7.2,a the bias is added b the weighted sum
277.28,7.28,of the inputs is calculated c specific
280.88,6.08,neuron is activated d the result is fed

304.639,5.441,deep learning and ai we seem to have
307.199,4.801,only scratched the surface in fact horus
