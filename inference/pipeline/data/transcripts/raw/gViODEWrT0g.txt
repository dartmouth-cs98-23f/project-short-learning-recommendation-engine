second,duration,transcript
0.0,3.959,so what you're going to need to do
1.38,4.62,listen to me closely
3.959,3.9,if you clicked on this video consider it
6.0,3.36,a contract between you and me that
7.859,2.82,you're going to watch this video in full
9.36,3.12,and you're going to want actually going
10.679,4.021,to need to do that because the data
12.48,3.659,science job outlook is dramatically
14.7,3.54,changing right now it's changing very
16.139,3.361,fast and it's changing a lot so we're
18.24,3.119,going to need to know what to do here
19.5,3.9,what do you do well I'm going to talk
21.359,4.321,about that in this video but firstly I
23.4,4.44,want to explain that data science jobs
25.68,3.66,are not close to dying okay they're not
27.84,3.12,getting automated we're getting more and
29.34,3.719,more data we're getting more and more
30.96,3.24,insights from this data if people are
33.059,2.821,going to look at it you can't just get
34.2,2.879,insights from a computer those are
35.88,2.58,machine learning models you can build
37.079,3.421,those but we still need to know what to
38.46,4.2,do with them all of this stuff we're
40.5,4.26,going to need humans for them however
42.66,4.079,the job outlook is changing a lot right
44.76,4.139,now and in this video at the end I'm
46.739,4.441,going to say one massive piece of advice
48.899,3.721,You're Gonna Want To Know a skill that
51.18,3.48,you're going to need to build so that
52.62,4.919,you are able to set yourself apart from
54.66,4.5,the competition and able to avoid the
57.539,3.601,automation of Chad GPT we'll talk about
59.16,5.039,that at the end but firstly you know
61.14,5.64,data science jobs they're there however
64.199,4.801,exploratory data analysis is not quite
66.78,3.78,what it used to be it's a lot easier to
69.0,3.0,actually get this stuff done I think
70.56,3.54,it's still very important to be able to
72.0,3.659,understand python code to be able to
74.1,3.66,understand the library so that you're
75.659,4.381,able to do things and tweak the charge
77.76,3.719,BT responses as you need to so it's
80.04,3.119,extremely important to do these things
81.479,3.541,because everybody's going to be able to
83.159,4.32,code now it's not as hard as it used to
85.02,3.54,be however if you know the skills you
87.479,2.64,are going to be much better than the
88.56,3.239,people that don't they might still be
90.119,4.381,able to use chat gbt but they're going
91.799,4.5,to struggle so of course companies are
94.5,3.299,going to want to beat the same people as
96.299,4.5,they did before they're going to want
97.799,4.981,data scientists however it is going to
100.799,3.601,be easier to fake being a data scientist
102.78,3.36,right now because what is what has
104.4,4.079,everybody been suggesting to get a job
106.14,3.96,oh a little bit of credentials and then
108.479,3.42,just Spam projects make really really
110.1,4.68,good projects no it's going to be a lot
111.899,4.321,more about actually knowing the skills
114.78,4.14,okay so you're going to need to take
116.22,5.399,courses online to get an education or
118.92,4.68,somewhere and then come back and build
121.619,3.841,projects because anyone could build
123.6,4.08,projects now like it's so easy before
125.46,3.779,what you had to do was to just grab a
127.68,2.76,Blog and then fiddle with it and then
129.239,2.881,you'd probably get an error and then
130.44,4.26,you'd fight with it I know you've done
132.12,5.04,this okay so oftentimes we give up from
134.7,4.38,that jtbt is making it a lot easier just
137.16,4.74,to build these projects online and so
139.08,5.46,you're gonna need to have all the skills
141.9,4.14,the software architecture skills the of
144.54,3.54,course the the libraries and the
146.04,5.04,Frameworks and the actual language
148.08,5.82,itself but more about building full
151.08,4.799,applications Chachi BT is great at
153.9,3.78,building code it can you can iterate
155.879,5.461,with it and build applications very very
157.68,6.3,quickly however what it cannot do is
161.34,4.619,piece things together okay it can build
163.98,4.5,individual Lego blocks but it cannot
165.959,4.5,build a Lego castle you need someone or
168.48,3.96,company is going to need people that
170.459,4.56,understand all of the Lego blocks what
172.44,4.14,each of them do and how to put them
175.019,3.481,together okay it's going to be a lot
176.58,4.2,more about actually putting things
178.5,4.019,together and of course it's still
180.78,4.08,writing code I'm not saying that you're
182.519,4.261,not going to need to write code but it's
184.86,3.959,getting faster and companies are going
186.78,5.22,to need less people to actually write
188.819,4.741,this code because like if developers are
192.0,3.18,just writing code so much faster than
193.56,2.88,they used to be I'm working on a startup
195.18,3.24,right now you'll see the results
196.44,3.18,hopefully this year I really hope this
198.42,4.08,year hopefully by the end of the summer
199.62,5.039,but I am writing code extremely quickly
202.5,3.48,right now in languages that I am
204.659,3.3,learning at the same time like
205.98,4.38,JavaScript I don't know very well but
207.959,5.401,with Chad GPT I'm writing JavaScript
210.36,5.94,code and I am using it all the time so
213.36,5.76,trust me coding is just easier than it
216.3,4.92,used to be my God but anyways chatgpt is
219.12,3.96,so so good at writing code in many areas
221.22,3.72,and so it's going to be a lot more about
223.08,4.62,knowing these individual Lego pieces
224.94,5.519,being able to put them together and 100
227.7,6.899,this is what you absolutely need to know
230.459,5.821,is gcp AWS Azure building actual
234.599,3.301,applications putting all the pieces
236.28,4.56,together to build a final product
237.9,5.399,because again data analysts data data
240.84,4.679,exploratory data analysis simple uh data
243.299,4.741,science stuff it's still useful it's
245.519,4.92,still extremely useful and I I'm not
248.04,4.32,saying that it's going away however it's
250.439,3.961,just easier you're still going to need
252.36,4.379,to know all of these skills if you're a
254.4,3.78,data scientist you absolutely should
256.739,4.261,still know python all these
258.18,4.739,visualization libraries SQL all the
261.0,3.36,normal stuff like tensorflow Pi torch
262.919,4.5,whatever for machine learning models
264.36,5.76,however your actual job is getting
267.419,4.741,easier in some ways with the you know
270.12,4.859,traditional analytics is getting easier
272.16,5.22,however it's going to merge into
274.979,4.681,building full applications okay I've
277.38,4.86,said this in previous videos it is more
279.66,4.74,important than ever right now to learn
282.24,4.26,all of this data science stuff and then
284.4,3.66,learn how to build actual applications
286.5,2.699,and you can do it in the reverse way if
288.06,2.82,you want you can absolutely build
289.199,3.301,applications and then you can learn data
290.88,3.9,science there's still going to be a lot
292.5,5.1,of roles in data science however they're
294.78,5.1,merging into doing multiple things at
297.6,4.92,the same time using your analytics to
299.88,4.86,build these applications okay now
302.52,4.02,there's still going to be those base
304.74,4.5,analytics roles where you're just doing
306.54,6.0,simple visualizations and stuff and
309.24,5.58,presenting them however it's hard to say
312.54,4.02,how many people they're really going to
314.82,3.599,need to do that because they're just so
316.56,4.02,efficient these days and more and more
318.419,3.541,people are going to be able to do that
320.58,3.48,so what you're going to need to do
321.96,4.64,listen to me closely
324.06,6.479,be really really really really really
326.6,5.98,good at your job it's not just learn
330.539,4.021,some analytics make a Jupiter notebook
332.58,4.02,and you can get a job anymore I'm sorry
334.56,4.199,you should still learn all of those
336.6,5.64,skills and you're going to need them but
338.759,5.641,build full applications learn Advanced
342.24,4.32,machine learning architectures so that
344.4,4.56,you can actually expand upon the
346.56,4.8,company's skill set build their own
348.96,4.679,Technologies out and not just be one of
351.36,5.72,the many many people that are able to do
353.639,7.28,these simple analytics you got it okay
357.08,3.839,subscribe bye bye
