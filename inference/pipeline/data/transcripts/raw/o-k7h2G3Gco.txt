1.438,1.502,Hey there!
2.94,4.62,This is Sahn.
7.56,4.08,"In today's video, I'm going to share with you our  "
11.64,3.12,"proven strategies for crushing 
your system design interviews."
14.76,5.04,"Having interviewed countless candidates, I’ve 
seen up close what works and what falls short  "
19.8,3.06,"when it comes to preparing 
for these tough interviews."
23.64,3.42,"Stick with me for the next few minutes, 
and I’ll guide you through a preparation  "
27.06,4.14,"approach that’ll have you tackling any 
system design question with confidence."
31.2,1.44,Let's dive right in!
33.48,3.96,"First off, you might be wondering: 
what is a system design interview?"
37.44,4.08,"At a high level, its purpose 
is to assess your ability to:"
41.52,5.7,"One, translate an ambiguous problem statement 
into concrete technical requirements."
47.22,5.28,"Two, craft an architecture and design 
that satisfies those requirements."
52.5,5.1,"Three, articulate and defend your design 
decisions throughout the discussion."
58.62,5.22,"You’ll be asked to design large scale systems 
like an Instagram feed, Uber ride sharing,  "
63.84,3.54,"Twitter timelines, or even the 
infrastructure behind Google Search."
67.38,4.74,"Remember, there’s no such thing as 
the ""right"" or “perfect” solution."
72.78,2.82,"The goal is to demonstrate 
your technical expertise,  "
75.6,4.56,"your approach to problem solving, and 
your skills to communicate effectively."
81.18,4.32,"Now, you may be wondering - why should we care 
about preparing for system design questions?"
85.5,1.56,What's the big deal?
87.66,1.32,"Well, here’s the main reason:"
88.98,4.8,"Your performance in a system design 
interview can often determine whether  "
93.78,5.1,"you land a senior engineer position, or if 
you’re considered for a more junior role."
99.42,2.58,"Once you’ve clocked in a 
few years in the industry,  "
102.0,5.34,"system design is how companies gauge your 
ability to build complex systems at scale."
107.88,2.88,"Essentially, shine bright in 
the system design interview,  "
110.76,2.64,and you’re on track for those senior titles.
113.4,5.22,"But if you hit bumps along the way, you could 
be looking at offers for more junior positions."
118.62,4.2,"So it pays to put in the work and 
take these interviews seriously."
124.02,1.2,You might be thinking:
125.22,4.5,"How on earth can these companies assess our 
abilities in such a short period of time?"
129.72,3.6,"And you’d be right - they can’t, not fully."
133.32,4.02,"These interviews are, in many ways, 
proxies for real-world scenarios."
137.34,2.28,They are an approximation at best.
140.28,5.1,"It’s on us to help the interviewers get the 
signals they need so they can vouch for us."
145.38,2.52,"It’s not a perfect system, by any means,  "
147.9,4.08,"but companies are always wary of 
the repercussions of a wrong hire."
152.52,4.14,"These simulated challenges are often the 
best tool they have at their disposal."
157.56,3.3,"So, how should we prepare for 
these demanding interviews?"
160.86,4.86,"Here’s a blueprint that’s consistently 
worked for acing system design questions:"
166.86,3.72,"First and foremost, practice, 
practice, and practice."
170.58,4.44,"Get hands-on with designing real-world 
apps and services we use regularly,  "
175.02,2.88,"like Instagram, Uber, and Gmail."
177.9,3.48,"Just reading about the underlying 
architectures isn’t enough."
181.38,2.34,Take out a pen and paper and draw!
183.72,4.98,"We must push ourselves to sketch out the core 
components and how they interact with one another."
189.54,4.32,"For example, design the backend 
architecture for Instagram from scratch."
193.86,4.2,"Think through the key parts like the 
frontend clients that users interact with,  "
198.06,5.94,"the application servers processing millions 
of requests, the caching mechanisms to speed  "
204.0,6.6,"up response times, the dedicated databases for 
storing posts, comments and feeds, and of course,  "
210.6,4.98,"the distributed object storage essential 
for hosting billions of photos and videos."
216.9,6.0,"Then sketch out how the main flows work - like how 
would an end-user’s image get uploaded and stored?"
222.9,4.38,"How would the algorithms determine 
the order of posts in a user’s feed?"
228.0,4.5,"How would the system leverage cached data 
and when would it make database calls?"
232.5,3.42,Actively constructing each piece of the puzzle not  
235.92,3.18,"only deepens understanding 
but reinforces retention."
240.12,6.0,"Next, study common design patterns like 
load balancing, database sharding, content  "
246.12,4.38,"delivery networks, caching frequently 
accessed data, just to name a few."
251.22,3.24,"Know the pros and cons of 
different approaches so you  "
254.46,2.16,can intelligently weigh tradeoffs in the design.
256.62,5.82,"If you’re interested, we have plenty of videos 
on many system design patterns on this channel."
263.7,3.12,"When studying these patterns, anticipate the types  "
266.82,4.38,"of questions an interviewer may ask 
and practice responding confidently."
271.86,4.74,"For example, questions like ""Why did you 
choose Redis for caching instead of Memcached?"
276.6,5.7,"Be ready to dive into technical details 
like Redis’ superior data structures and  "
282.3,2.88,"its persistence options, to justify your choices."
286.44,5.58,"Also, get very comfortable using whiteboards, 
diagramming apps, and other visual tools."
292.02,4.74,"In many interviews, you'll be required 
to visually represent your thoughts."
296.76,4.02,"Whether it's a whiteboard during an 
in-person interview or a diagramming  "
300.78,4.26,"application for virtual setups, 
become proficient with these tools."
305.04,4.02,"You want the tools themselves to be 
second nature so you can focus on  "
309.06,3.9,"communicating the design effectively, 
not struggling with the interface."
313.62,4.02,"And finally, do regular mock 
interviews to practice end-to-end."
317.64,4.86,"Nothing beats real-time practice that mimics 
the settings and pressures of the real deal."
322.5,5.04,"Get feedback not just on the technical 
design, but also on your communication skills,  "
327.54,4.86,"ability to think on your feet, and on how 
efficiently you manage the allotted time."
332.4,6.42,"Use mock interviews as a mirror, reflecting 
areas of strength and those needing improvement."
338.82,3.54,"During the interview, start out by asking targeted  "
342.36,4.32,"questions to deeply understand the 
use cases, scalability requirements,  "
346.68,4.38,"technical constraints, and other key 
parameters before starting your design."
351.06,3.48,Avoid the temptation to dive right into proposing  
354.54,3.48,"features – first nail down the 
core requirements and scope."
358.8,2.88,Be hyper aware of managing your time wisely.
361.68,6.06,"Between introductions, clarifying questions, 
diagramming, and minor interruptions,  "
367.74,3.72,"your actual design time is far less 
than the full interview length."
371.46,5.28,"Every minute counts, so pace yourself 
appropriately and keep moving forward."
376.74,3.12,Identify any potential time sinks in advance.
380.94,2.1,"As you diagram out components,  "
383.04,4.56,"flows and bottlenecks, think out loud and 
verbally walk through your thought process."
387.6,2.76,"Explain your rationale, trade-offs,  "
390.36,3.6,"and decisions - don’t make the interviewer 
guess what’s going on in your head."
393.96,2.34,Vocalize assumptions as well.
397.02,3.84,"As you walk through your design, 
document the key aspects on the  "
400.86,3.0,"whiteboard so the interviewer 
can follow your thought process."
403.86,2.76,Break the system into logical components.
406.62,4.26,"Highlight the main data flows 
and dependencies between them."
410.88,4.14,"Avoid getting bogged down in 
low-level details - focus on  "
415.02,3.06,"architecting the high-level 
design and broader tradeoffs."
418.86,2.94,"If you get stuck, take a breath and don't panic."
421.8,3.0,Ask clarifying questions to resolve uncertainties.
424.8,4.44,"Think through issues incrementally 
and systematically to get unblocked."
429.24,5.78,"Overcoming obstacles and making progress with 
incomplete information is part of the challenge."
435.02,3.58,"If you’d like more guidance on 
what to do during the interview,  "
438.6,5.64,"we have a video on using our structured 
4-step approach to system design interviews."
444.84,4.32,"Alright, that wraps up our key strategies 
for crushing system design interviews!"
449.16,4.74,"I know these kinds of open-ended architecture 
questions can seem intimidating at first,  "
453.9,3.54,"but with focused practice using 
the techniques I outlined,  "
457.44,3.84,"you'll be consistently nailing 
system design in no time."
461.82,1.44,There are no shortcuts.
463.26,1.44,It’ll take some hard work.
464.7,3.3,"Best of luck with your upcoming 
interviews, you got this!"
