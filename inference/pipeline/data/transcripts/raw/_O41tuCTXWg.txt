0.29,6.39,natural language processing also known
3.689,5.071,as NLP is a subfield of linguistics
6.68,3.85,computer science and artificial
8.76,3.78,intelligence concerned with the
10.53,4.92,interactions between computers and human
12.54,6.3,natural languages the ultimate objective
15.45,6.089,of NLP is to read decipher understand
18.84,4.17,and make sense of the human languages in
21.539,4.201,a manner that is valuable
23.01,4.83,most NLP techniques rely on machine
25.74,5.34,learning to derive meaning from human
27.84,5.7,languages NLP is the driving force
31.08,5.37,behind the personal assistance word
33.54,5.25,processors like Microsoft Word language
36.45,5.28,translation applications and much more
38.79,5.67,it is one of the biggest subfields of AI
41.73,5.69,mainly because you use it every day with
44.46,6.3,Siri Google Translate Microsoft Word
47.42,5.65,etcetera but how does NLP work this
50.76,5.939,human machine NLP interaction can be
53.07,6.48,described in two typical steps at first
56.699,4.561,NLP entails applying algorithms to
59.55,3.72,identify and extract the natural
61.26,4.229,language rules such that the
63.27,3.87,unstructured language day 2 is converted
65.489,4.801,into a form that computers can
67.14,5.519,understand then when the text has been
70.29,4.77,provided the computer will utilize
72.659,4.681,algorithms to extract meaning associated
75.06,4.949,with every sentence and collect the
77.34,4.98,essential data from them let's see a
80.009,4.921,simple example with those two steps
82.32,6.72,between a machine and a human just like
84.93,7.5,Siri or okay Google would using NLP at
89.04,5.85,first a human talks to the machine then
92.43,5.369,the machine captures the audio and the
94.89,5.07,audio to text conversion takes place it
97.799,5.1,then processed the texts data and
99.96,5.1,convert it into an audio file the
102.899,5.491,machine then responds to the human by
105.06,5.43,playing the audio file sometimes the
108.39,4.32,computer may fail to understand the
110.49,5.43,meaning of a sentence well leading to
112.71,5.61,obscure results for example when someone
115.92,4.949,uses a sarcastic remark to pass
118.32,6.0,information the machine may not
120.869,5.701,interpret it well in short while humans
124.32,4.919,can easily master a language the
126.57,4.71,ambiguity and imprecise characteristics
129.239,3.701,of the natural languages are what make
131.28,5.05,NLP difficult for me
132.94,5.82,to implement these challenges in natural
136.33,4.83,language processing frequently involves
138.76,4.44,speech recognition natural language
141.16,5.04,understanding and natural language
143.2,6.12,generation which we will see in the next
146.2,6.8,videos subscribe to not miss any of
149.32,3.68,those terms clearly explained
