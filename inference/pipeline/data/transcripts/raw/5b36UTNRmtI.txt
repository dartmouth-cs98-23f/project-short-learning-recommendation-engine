8.639,4.721,a computer software is a set of
10.48,5.039,instructions data or programs used to
13.36,5.12,operate a computer or perform a
15.519,5.041,particular task in a system but today we
18.48,5.6,are going to look into something that is
20.56,6.32,known as sdlc sdlc refers to the
24.08,4.32,development of a software for a system
26.88,3.44,hi guys and welcome to yet and
28.4,3.679,interesting we video i simply learn but
30.32,4.64,before we begin if you love watching
32.079,4.48,tech videos subscribe to our channel and
34.96,3.919,hit the bell icon to remiss an update
36.559,3.761,from us now without further ado let's
38.879,3.68,take a look at the agenda for this
40.32,6.079,session
42.559,5.361,the first heading is what is sdlc
46.399,4.241,to begin with we will know some
47.92,6.799,introductory knowledge about sdlc
50.64,5.759,moving on with why do we apply sdlc
54.719,3.201,continuing with different phases
56.399,2.96,involved in the development of a
57.92,4.24,software
59.359,5.52,as for the last different models used to
62.16,6.72,develop sdlc let's begin with the first
64.879,4.001,heading that is sdlc
69.28,5.199,the software development lifecycle or
71.439,6.0,sdlc refers to the planned designing of
74.479,5.761,software models that are systematically
77.439,6.961,evaluated at each point by different
80.24,7.36,protocols involved in the sdlc phases
84.4,5.52,the sdlc process is defined using
87.6,5.12,multiple phases that involves different
89.92,6.08,protocols to be acted upon the software
92.72,6.719,development for example planning phase
96.0,4.479,defining designing phase building
99.439,4.481,testing
100.479,5.841,deploying and maintenance
103.92,4.4,these are some of the main phases that
106.32,4.24,leads to development of a software for
108.32,4.56,the client
110.56,6.0,moving on let's take a look at why do we
112.88,3.68,apply the sdlc cycle
117.36,4.88,the reason to apply the sdlc lifecycle
120.0,3.2,in the development of a software is
122.24,4.0,because
123.2,6.16,it provides a team with a developed
126.24,6.8,lifecycle format or a framework to build
129.36,6.32,a software from scratch
133.04,4.4,it provides better control over each
135.68,3.52,development phase of the software
137.44,3.76,designing
139.2,4.399,where the coding is to be done what
141.2,4.48,about the errors in the development
143.599,4.481,and different particular points or
145.68,4.559,attributes that affect the functioning
148.08,4.64,of a software
150.239,4.961,it also improved client interaction with
152.72,4.799,the multiple development phases of the
155.2,3.679,software now let's move on to the next
157.519,3.041,heading that is
158.879,5.281,different phases that involve the
160.56,6.56,development of a software
164.16,5.28,the sdlc lifecycle is divided into
167.12,4.16,multiple steps to provide a better end
169.44,3.36,product according to the client's
171.28,4.0,request
172.8,2.48,which are
175.599,4.081,planning and requirement analysis at
177.76,4.16,this step the planning and the
179.68,4.0,requirement of the software is discussed
181.92,4.8,with the client
183.68,5.44,moving on with defining the requirements
186.72,4.4,according to the planned scenario we
189.12,4.64,will define certain terms for
191.12,5.6,development of the software
193.76,5.28,containing with designing the software
196.72,5.28,coding or implementing the physical
199.04,4.88,points of the software
202.0,5.28,moving on to the testing phase where
203.92,6.16,different scenarios are used to test the
207.28,5.2,overall functioning of a software
210.08,4.799,as for the last step we have deployment
212.48,3.52,and maintenance where the developed
214.879,4.64,software
216.0,6.159,is deployed and is assessed by the users
219.519,4.561,to check for any errors or bugs moving
222.159,5.121,on let's take a look at the individual
224.08,5.6,phases of sdlc the first phase is
227.28,4.72,planning and requirement analysis
229.68,3.839,planning is the most important step for
232.0,3.68,software development
233.519,6.08,the developer performs the requirement
235.68,6.479,analysis for the software in theme
239.599,4.56,moving on the software development data
242.159,3.28,is obtained from client service and
244.159,4.08,information
245.439,4.641,which are used from consumers or sales
248.239,4.321,team
250.08,4.48,the analysis data acts as the basis for
252.56,4.239,planning the development route for the
254.56,5.04,required software
256.799,4.321,also the analysis data is used to check
259.6,4.319,for any risk
261.12,5.519,as for quality assurance of the software
263.919,5.72,being developed at different stages of
266.639,3.0,sdlc
269.759,5.921,moving on we have the second stage that
272.32,3.36,is defining requirements
275.84,4.4,with the completion of planning step the
278.4,4.079,next step is to present the software
280.24,4.959,requirements and documents to the client
282.479,4.881,and the stakeholders for verification if
285.199,3.921,they are satisfied with the planned
287.36,4.0,scenario
289.12,4.16,the task of defining requirement is
291.36,5.04,performed by the software requirement
293.28,4.479,specification document also known as srs
296.4,3.519,document
297.759,4.241,which include all the data and
299.919,4.401,information related to the product been
302.0,4.96,developed
304.32,5.439,moving on we have the third step
306.96,6.32,that is designing the software
309.759,6.961,in this step the srs document is used by
313.28,5.6,the developer to use the most optimized
316.72,3.44,architecture for the development of the
318.88,3.759,software
320.16,5.52,the developed architecture is used using
322.639,5.28,the dds document also known as design
325.68,4.16,document specification
327.919,3.601,which is shared with the analyst and the
329.84,4.88,stakeholders to check multiple
331.52,4.88,attributes of the software
334.72,3.84,moving on after accessing all the
336.4,6.079,possible attributes the best software
338.56,3.919,design is used for the development
343.199,4.161,depending upon the requirements
345.12,3.84,different designs are used to develop
347.36,3.6,the software
348.96,5.12,the first one is known as high level
350.96,5.76,design and the other one is known as low
354.08,2.64,level design
356.96,4.4,moving on let's take a look at the
358.72,6.08,fourth step of sdlc
361.36,5.279,that is developing software
364.8,4.239,using the designing outcome from the
366.639,4.4,previous step the developers begin the
369.039,4.321,coding implementation which is in
371.039,5.041,accordance with the architecture design
373.36,4.72,by the developers
376.08,4.64,programming tools such as interpreters
378.08,5.76,compilers and debuggers are used to
380.72,5.919,design the best and the most organized
383.84,2.799,software design
386.8,8.399,it is developed using multiple languages
389.759,7.601,for example python kotlin java c
395.199,5.12,now let's move on to the next stage that
397.36,5.679,is software testing
400.319,5.281,in this stage the developed software is
403.039,4.88,tested with multiple test cases
405.6,4.64,and different scenarios to ensure proper
407.919,4.481,execution of all the functions included
410.24,3.92,in the software
412.4,5.2,with respect to the testing of a
414.16,8.0,software in sdlc each phase has multiple
417.6,7.2,case scenarios to assess it
422.16,4.96,through all the test cases done the bugs
424.8,4.399,errors or the flaws of the software
427.12,4.799,product are fixed that are to meet the
429.199,5.041,requirement of the client as well as the
431.919,5.361,srs document now let's move on to the
434.24,5.92,last heading in phases of sdlc
437.28,4.72,that is deployment and maintenance of
440.16,4.479,software
442.0,5.12,after the completion of testing phase
444.639,4.801,the last step is to deploy the completed
447.12,5.199,product in the market
449.44,5.84,which is to be used by the users and
452.319,5.6,check for any issues that may arise
455.28,2.639,using that
458.08,3.519,with regard to the maintenance of the
459.759,5.041,software there are generally three
461.599,4.801,formats to be used the first one known
464.8,3.6,as upgrade
466.4,3.76,that is upgrading the application to the
468.4,2.96,latest system version
470.16,2.56,then we have
471.36,4.08,bug fixing
472.72,5.199,that is removing errors or any bugs that
475.44,4.08,may arise during the execution of the
477.919,4.321,software
479.52,5.44,as for the last we have enhancement that
482.24,4.799,means installation of new features for
484.96,3.919,the existing product with this we are
487.039,5.041,completed with the multiple steps
488.879,5.04,involved in the sdlc processing now
492.08,2.72,let's move on to the next heading that
493.919,4.481,is
494.8,3.6,models used in sdlc
499.36,5.839,the sdlc models are applied because they
502.72,5.68,provide a pre-designed model
505.199,5.601,for the developer to use
508.4,4.879,let's take a look at multiple models
510.8,5.359,that sdlc applies
513.279,4.481,the first one is waterfall model
516.159,3.281,incremental model
517.76,3.199,iterative model
519.44,4.959,spiral model
520.959,5.201,v model and the last agile model
524.399,5.361,these are some of the most
526.16,6.0,generally used models in sdlc
529.76,4.4,but the thing is why do we apply these
532.16,4.56,models in sdlc
534.16,4.48,because they provide a base for planning
536.72,3.52,software projects for multiple
538.64,4.24,attributes
540.24,5.279,it also provide a pre-applied framework
542.88,4.959,for the new software project
545.519,3.921,as well it decreases the chances of bugs
547.839,3.761,and errors occurring in the software
549.44,4.399,with this we are completed with all the
551.6,4.72,headings in the session for sdlc
553.839,4.481,lifecycle if you have any questions
556.32,3.76,regarding the topic you can ask them in
