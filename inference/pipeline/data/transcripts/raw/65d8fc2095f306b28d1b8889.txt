intelligence is an attribute associated
with humans
so when we try to mimic this
intelligence in a machine
we call this artificial intelligence
so by definition any method that mimics
human behavior
is known as artificial intelligence
the machines are programmed using code
and in coding we have
different methods such as if statements
while loops
for loops etc so using these methods
if we can replicate human behavior this
would be artificial intelligence
but it would not perform very well this
is because
this method is an explicit way of
programming
which means we are defining each and
every possible scenario
and what to do if that scenario occurs
if we take an example of a self-driving
car then this would mean
that we are defining each and every
possibility
that could happen on the road while
driving
like if there is a human in front we
have to stop
if there is water on the road we have to
slow down
and if the green light is on we should
drive
now these scenarios they sound very
simple if you look at them individually
but what if a human is in front the road
is wet
and the traffic light is green all at
the same time
what should you do then so in theory
there are infinite possible scenarios so
writing all of these scenarios would not
be possible
so here comes machine learning to the
rescue
now machine learning is a part of
artificial intelligence
but the main difference here is that it
is not based on
explicit programming this means that
instead of us defining the rules
the machine itself will learn the rules
let's take an example let's say we want
the machine to learn
the difference between cats and dogs
in this case we will define some
features of the cat
and some features of the dog that
separates them
from each other now this feature
definition
is happening in numbers rather than just
saying
dogs have bigger ears than cats
so based on these features the machine
is able
to learn the difference between a cat
and
a dog now this is known as a
classification problem
where we have a limited number of
classes and we need to sort out
new data into one of these classes
the other main type of problem is the
regression problem
where we have a continuous number rather
than
limited classifications so let's take an
example of
real estate let's say we want to know
the price of a house
based on its location number of beds and
the size in square feet so these three
values are basically our features
so we will give the machine some
previous data
where we know the location number of
beds
the size and the price so once the
machine trains itself
it would be able to give an estimate
price of the new house
given the location the number of
bedrooms the size
in square feet is provided note that the
price here is a continuous number
like 352 000.
if this was a classification problem the
classes
of the price would be low medium
or high so the two major types of
machine learning problems
are classification and regression
but even with the machine learning the
process is not fully intelligent
as humans are the ones that are
providing features
in order for it to learn in the case of
the cat and dog classification we had to
define the features of a cat
and features of a dog so
now comes the deep learning to the
rescue
deep learning is a subset of machine
learning
the idea of deep learning is inspired by
the human brain
that consists of billions of neurons
based on these neuron architecture we
create an artificial neural
network and when this neural network has
multiple layers
we call it deep neural network hence the
term
deep learning so here the idea is that
we just show the machine different
images of
cats and dogs and it finds the relevant
features
that separate them by itself and trains
itself to differentiate between cats and
dogs
this method is closest method to the
human intelligence
and therefore has shown promising
results in many
different fields let's take the example
of
a self-driving car for understanding
this further
as humans we just see the surroundings
from our
eyes and based on that we decide on
whether to break
accelerate or steer the car
now this we learn over the years by
observing and practicing
in our head we are not calculating
actual values
the same way we can collect images from
a camera
and record the stating angle
acceleration and the breaking values
and then we can use this data to train
our machine
now when a new image is shown to the
machine
it will decide by itself how much to
accelerate
brake and steer note that
in this example we did not define any
features
such as road lanes pumps or even
obstacles
it observed and learned by itself which
features are relevant for driving
this is how most big companies are
approaching the self-driving problem
in fact nvidia even shared their
self-driving ai model
and their results they were able to
drive a car
using this method by just training the
model with
72 hours of driving data
so in summary ai is mimicking
human behavior by any means whereas
machine learning is a subset of ai that
does not use
explicit programming that means that it
is not using any fixed rules but
requires
features from humans deep learning is a
subset
of machine learning that does not
require any feature definition
from humans it is able to decide by
itself
which features are relevant and train
itself on the given data
there are two main categories of
problems
one is the classification problem where
the result is a limited number
of classes for example cat and dog
the other one is the regression problem
where the result
is a continuous number for example price
of a house
so this was introduction to artificial
intelligence
machine learning and deep learning in
the upcoming videos we will explore each
of these
in detail and we will look at the
practical examples
including their coding so if you like
