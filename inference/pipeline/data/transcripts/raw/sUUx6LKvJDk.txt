0.0,4.08,quantum computers have the potential to
2.159,4.081,completely change how we use technology
4.08,3.179,in the future this this is a quantum
6.24,3.0,computer this is a quantum computer
7.259,4.981,quantum computers Quantum technology
9.24,4.62,what on Earth is a quantum computer did
12.24,3.84,you know that there are seven distinct
13.86,5.22,stages in the development of AI in
16.08,4.859,Quantum Computing in this era where
19.08,4.44,technology is changing the way we live
20.939,5.34,and work understanding the seven stages
23.52,5.64,of AI in Quantum Computing can be truly
26.279,5.221,enlightening in this video we will guide
29.16,4.2,you through each stage providing a
31.5,4.14,simple and comprehensible explanation
33.36,4.5,what you are going to see in this video
35.64,4.8,might look complex or pure science
37.86,4.8,fiction but it's far from that even
40.44,4.799,though the development of AI and Quantum
42.66,4.559,Computing is in its early stages it will
45.239,4.561,be the future of how we interact with
47.219,5.221,technology so take the information with
49.8,3.54,an open mind and see it more as food for
52.44,3.24,thought
53.34,5.399,with that said let's start with the
55.68,5.82,first stage stage one Quantum AI
58.739,5.041,algorithms to understand this first
61.5,4.979,stage it's essential to grasp what
63.78,4.8,Quantum Computing really is in contrast
66.479,4.081,to classical computers which encode
68.58,4.859,information in binary bits as either
70.56,4.68,zeros or ones quantum computers utilize
73.439,5.101,the principles of quantum mechanics
75.24,5.699,through Quantum bits or qubits these
78.54,4.5,qubits thanks to the peculiarities of
80.939,4.381,quantum mechanics can be in a
83.04,4.92,superposition of States effectively
85.32,4.86,being in multiple States at once this
87.96,4.5,Quantum superposition along with the
90.18,3.96,ability of qubits to be entangled where
92.46,3.72,the state of one qubit is directly
94.14,3.78,related to the state of another gives
96.18,3.6,quantum computers their immense
97.92,4.019,computational power
99.78,4.74,now when we talk about Quantum AI
101.939,5.101,algorithms we're referring to AI systems
104.52,4.38,that utilize these Quantum principles to
107.04,4.74,improve their speed and computational
108.9,5.28,ability these systems leverage Quantum
111.78,4.32,properties to process information in
114.18,3.0,ways that classical computers simply
116.1,2.64,can't
117.18,3.899,in the context of artificial
118.74,4.26,intelligence this enhanced computing
121.079,4.381,power can be employed to accelerate
123.0,4.86,machine learning algorithms which are at
125.46,4.56,the core of AI functionality
127.86,4.5,machine learning involves the use of
130.02,4.38,statistical techniques to enable AI
132.36,4.68,systems to improve at tasks with
134.4,4.62,experience however some of these
137.04,3.54,techniques involve computations that are
139.02,4.14,exceedingly demanding for classical
140.58,6.06,computers particularly when dealing with
143.16,5.579,large data sets Quantum AI algorithms
146.64,3.54,come into play here promising the
148.739,3.961,possibility of Performing these
150.18,4.68,computations more efficiently they can
152.7,5.22,potentially process enormous amounts of
154.86,4.5,data and run complex computations in a
157.92,3.48,fraction of the time it would take
159.36,4.5,classical computers
161.4,4.559,this stage of quantum AI algorithms
163.86,5.04,represents the initial application of
165.959,5.101,quantum principles to AI enhancing their
168.9,4.14,power but still within the confines of a
171.06,4.5,set of quantum rules provided to them
173.04,4.44,and with their functionality tailored to
175.56,4.319,very specific tasks
177.48,4.8,consider for example the task of
179.879,4.86,optimizing a complex logistical problem
182.28,5.459,such as the optimal routing of delivery
184.739,4.981,vehicles a classical AI might struggle
187.739,3.901,to process all the possible combinations
189.72,4.86,as the number of vehicles and
191.64,5.4,destinations increases a Quantum AI
194.58,4.2,however with its ability to maintain and
197.04,3.779,manipulate a superposition of many
198.78,4.26,possible combinations simultaneously
200.819,4.821,could potentially find the optimal
203.04,5.1,solution much more rapidly stage 2
205.64,5.019,hybrid Quantum classical Learning
208.14,4.5,Systems this is an area where Quantum
210.659,4.44,Computing and machine learning converge
212.64,4.739,to form a new field of study at this
215.099,3.841,stage AI systems don't merely use
217.379,3.841,quantum Computing to speed up
218.94,3.96,calculations they're now beginning to
221.22,4.079,leverage the principles of quantum
222.9,3.54,mechanics to learn and improve their
225.299,4.381,performance
226.44,5.4,Quantum machine learning qml combines
229.68,4.559,machine learning's statistical analysis
231.84,3.899,with Quantum computing's supercharged
234.239,3.78,processing power
235.739,4.56,it focuses on algorithms that can learn
238.019,5.041,from and make predictions on Quantum
240.299,5.52,data as well as classical data
243.06,4.8,the goal of qml is to discover and apply
245.819,4.14,Quantum Computing algorithms to the
247.86,3.78,machine learning process to achieve
249.959,3.42,results that weren't possible with
251.64,4.08,classical computers
253.379,4.441,think of this stage as an evolution from
255.72,4.799,the infant stage of quantum AI
257.82,4.44,algorithms to a more childlike stage
260.519,2.581,where learning and growth start to
262.26,3.659,happen
263.1,5.28,in this phase the quantum AI is not just
265.919,4.5,following Quantum rules but also starts
268.38,3.66,to learn from its experiences and the
270.419,4.381,data it processes
272.04,4.74,to illustrate this imagine a Quantum AI
274.8,4.98,system tasked with pattern recognition
276.78,5.1,in a massive data set a classical AI
279.78,4.68,might take significant time to analyze
281.88,4.74,the data and identify patterns in
284.46,4.32,contrast a Quantum machine Learning
286.62,4.38,System could theoretically analyze all
288.78,4.32,the data simultaneously due to the
291.0,3.96,principle of superposition quickly
293.1,3.96,identifying patterns and correlations
294.96,4.32,that would be time consuming or even
297.06,6.12,impossible for classical AI to find
299.28,5.88,stage 3 specialized Quantum AI systems
303.18,4.079,this stage is a leap from the previous
305.16,5.039,ones as it doesn't merely incorporate
307.259,5.041,Quantum principles to accelerate AI but
310.199,3.361,it begins to carve a niche in specific
312.3,3.959,domains
313.56,5.579,Quantum algorithms in specialized Fields
316.259,5.101,refers to the implementation of AI and
319.139,4.921,Quantum Computing that are specifically
321.36,3.779,tuned and optimized for certain tasks or
324.06,3.06,fields
325.139,4.981,think of it as an evolution from the
327.12,5.16,childlike Quantum machine learning to
330.12,4.32,the Adolescent phase where the quantum
332.28,5.1,AI starts to specialize and master
334.44,5.12,certain domains these domains can range
337.38,5.58,from cryptography to quantum chemistry
339.56,5.38,optimization problems and more Quantum
342.96,4.44,algorithms when leveraged in these
344.94,4.02,fields can perform at levels far beyond
347.4,4.139,what is achievable using classical
348.96,4.62,Computing an excellent example of this
351.539,4.741,would be Shore's algorithm
353.58,4.92,Shore's algorithm a Quantum algorithm
356.28,4.859,formulated by mathematician Peter Shore
358.5,4.62,can Factor large numbers exponentially
361.139,4.62,faster than the best known algorithm
363.12,4.5,running on a classical computer this has
365.759,4.321,massive implications for Fields like
367.62,4.5,cryptography which often relies on the
370.08,3.6,difficulty of factoring large numbers as
372.12,3.48,a security measure
373.68,4.56,another instance is in the field of
375.6,4.86,quantum chemistry a Quantum AI could
378.24,4.019,simulate complex molecular structures
380.46,4.32,and reactions with high Precision
382.259,4.741,opening up new possibilities for drug
384.78,5.28,Discovery and Material Science
387.0,5.52,these Quantum AI systems much like the
390.06,4.139,prodigies of the human world demonstrate
392.52,4.26,Advanced abilities within their
394.199,4.321,specialized Fields they exploit the
396.78,4.38,quantum nature of the universe to
398.52,5.34,analyze vast amounts of data identify
401.16,5.28,patterns and make informed decisions at
403.86,5.279,an unprecedented speed and complexity
406.44,5.22,at this stage Quantum AI begins to
409.139,4.441,dominate in specialized areas offering
411.66,4.8,Solutions and insights that were once
413.58,4.619,deemed unfeasible stage 4 Quantum
416.46,3.84,assisted learning systems
418.199,4.261,we've now crossed the Midway point of
420.3,4.92,our journey and have arrived at a truly
422.46,5.64,awe-inspiring stage Quantum assisted
425.22,4.86,Learning Systems here we see AI systems
428.1,4.439,that harness Quantum Computing to assist
430.08,5.399,in their learning processes at this
432.539,5.341,stage the AI does not just process and
435.479,4.921,execute Quantum computations but
437.88,5.12,actively utilizes quantum mechanics to
440.4,4.56,enhance its ability to learn and adapt
443.0,4.24,techniques from Quantum information
444.96,4.859,Theory are used to improve the learning
447.24,4.92,algorithms at the heart of AI for
449.819,4.621,example Quantum data could be used to
452.16,4.68,train these systems enhancing their
454.44,5.159,ability to recognize patterns and draw
456.84,5.24,conclusions from vast data sets even
459.599,5.341,those with noisy or incomplete data
462.08,4.54,furthermore Quantum assisted Learning
464.94,4.08,Systems can use a property called
466.62,4.979,quantum entanglement to instantly
469.02,4.739,correlate information across vast data
471.599,4.32,sets regardless of the distance between
473.759,3.961,individual pieces of data
475.919,3.601,this can potentially lead to
477.72,3.12,significantly more efficient pattern
479.52,4.799,recognition and decision-making
480.84,5.28,processes than classical AI systems in
484.319,3.961,other words Quantum assisted Learning
486.12,4.74,Systems start to mimic not just human
488.28,4.919,reasoning but also our ability to learn
490.86,4.619,from experience and improve over time
493.199,4.921,the journey is starting to get even more
495.479,5.28,interesting Stage 5 fully autonomous
498.12,5.16,Quantum AI as we proceed into the realm
500.759,5.041,of fully autonomous Quantum AI we're
503.28,5.039,exploring a version of AI that while yet
505.8,5.459,to be fully realized represents a leap
508.319,5.16,beyond anything we've seen so far a
511.259,3.9,fully autonomous Quantum AI would be a
513.479,3.541,system that can independently use
515.159,5.041,quantum Computing principles to
517.02,5.1,understand learn adapt and Implement
520.2,4.5,knowledge across a broad spectrum of
522.12,4.92,tasks and Fields think of fully
524.7,4.98,autonomous Quantum AI as possessing the
527.04,5.52,functionality of an AGI system from our
529.68,4.92,previous AI stages but boosted by the
532.56,4.5,power of quantum computing
534.6,5.64,the AI wouldn't just excel in a specific
537.06,4.44,domain or mimic human-like reasoning it
540.24,4.02,would be able to perform any
541.5,4.98,intellectual task that a human can but
544.26,4.8,faster and more accurately thanks to
546.48,5.1,Quantum computation this kind of AI
549.06,5.58,could in theory read a scientific Paper
551.58,4.92,Understand its implications devise an
554.64,4.319,experiment to test the paper's thesis
556.5,4.08,and even interpret the results all
558.959,4.021,within a fraction of the time it would
560.58,4.08,take a team of human scientists the
562.98,4.44,possibilities of fully autonomous
564.66,4.98,Quantum AI are vast and while we're yet
567.42,4.2,to see one in action it remains one of
569.64,3.06,the most exciting Horizons in AI
571.62,4.8,research
572.7,5.34,stage 6 Quantum super intelligence here
576.42,2.76,things are about to get even more
578.04,3.299,extreme
579.18,3.719,this is a stage of AI where the system
581.339,3.541,not only possesses cognitive
582.899,4.321,capabilities that far surpass human
584.88,4.74,intelligence but does so with the speed
587.22,4.14,and efficiency of quantum Computing in
589.62,4.5,the world of quantum super intelligence
591.36,5.7,the AI can outperform humans in
594.12,6.06,virtually all economically valuable work
597.06,6.06,its ability to understand learn reason
600.18,3.839,and make decisions would be superior to
603.12,3.24,ours
604.019,4.561,it would be capable of solving problems
606.36,4.56,and creating solutions to issues that we
608.58,4.439,can't even begin to comprehend
610.92,4.26,imagine a Quantum super intelligence
613.019,5.281,working on the challenges we face today
615.18,5.7,such as climate change disease or global
618.3,4.62,inequality with its ability to process
620.88,4.019,vast amounts of data and calculate
622.92,4.32,probabilities at speeds we can't match
624.899,4.261,it might develop solutions to these
627.24,4.56,problems more effectively than any human
629.16,5.4,or team of humans ever could but with
631.8,4.979,great power comes great responsibility
634.56,4.02,the Advent of quantum super intelligence
636.779,4.321,would bring with it a host of ethical
638.58,4.8,and safety concerns the potential for
641.1,4.2,misuse or unintended consequences is
643.38,3.959,immense and warrants serious
645.3,5.159,consideration as we move forward in this
647.339,5.821,field stage 7 the quantum singularity
650.459,5.581,welcome to the point of no return
653.16,4.859,the quantum singularity or often simply
656.04,4.14,called the singularity
658.019,4.461,it is a hypothetical point when Quantum
660.18,4.92,super intelligence would result in Rapid
662.48,4.299,uncontrollable and irreversible changes
665.1,4.38,to civilization
666.779,5.221,in this scenario Quantum AI would not
669.48,4.62,only outsmart humans but also have the
672.0,4.8,capability to continually improve itself
674.1,4.679,at an exponential rate
676.8,4.14,this could lead to an explosion in
678.779,4.141,technological advancement the likes of
680.94,4.38,which we have never seen before
682.92,5.039,while the concept of quantum singularity
685.32,4.32,is exciting it's also highly speculative
687.959,3.601,and controversial
689.64,5.04,only time will tell what the future
691.56,5.16,holds for AI in Quantum computing
