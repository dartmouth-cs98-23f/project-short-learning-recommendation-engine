7.914,4.506,"Software architecture is to applications 
what foundations are to buildings."
12.42,4.5,"Build it wrong, and no matter how 
beautiful it looks, it'll crumble."
17.46,3.9,"In today’s discussion, we’ll unpack 
some prevalent software architecture  "
21.36,5.88,"patterns that form the backbone of countless 
applications and platforms we interact with daily."
27.9,5.16,"Over the next few minutes, we'll explore five 
key patterns that have shaped the industry."
34.02,2.1,Let's start with layered architecture.
36.12,4.86,"This pattern separates the components 
of a system into distinct layers,  "
40.98,6.12,"typically the presentation layer, business 
logic layer, and data access layer."
47.1,5.64,"For instance, in user interface design, we often 
see the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern."
52.74,3.12,It is a specialized form of layered architecture.
56.46,5.46,"Here, the Model represents data and 
business logic, the View displays this data,  "
61.92,5.64,"and the Presenter serves as a bridge to 
ensure a clean separation of concerns."
68.22,3.48,The primary goal of layered architectures is to  
71.7,5.52,"promote separation so changes in one 
layer don't negatively impact others."
77.22,3.48,"This structure provides 
abstraction and encapsulation,  "
80.7,3.24,with each layer having a distinct responsibility.
85.14,2.64,Next is event-driven architecture.
87.78,3.24,"This pattern promotes the 
production and consumption  "
91.02,4.38,"of events between loosely coupled 
software components and services."
96.36,3.78,"Components broadcast events 
when something notable happens,  "
100.14,5.04,"and other components subscribe to 
specific events they are interested in."
105.84,2.94,This allows for highly decoupled architectures.
109.32,4.32,"One prominent example in this domain is Command 
Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)."
113.64,7.56,"With CQRS, the data write operations (commands) 
are separated from read operations (queries),  "
121.2,3.3,and changes are often communicated through events.
125.04,2.94,This makes the system inherently event-driven.
127.98,5.46,"The pub/sub model, where components 
publish and subscribe to events,  "
133.44,2.52,is commonly used in such architectures.
135.96,6.3,"Here, components don't call each other 
directly; they merely react to published events."
143.76,2.4,Moving on to microkernel architecture.
146.16,5.22,"This pattern emphasizes separating 
core system functionality into  "
151.38,5.22,"a small microkernel and extended 
functionality into add-ons or plugins."
157.26,6.18,"In operating systems, for example, a 
microkernel might oversee vital tasks  "
163.44,6.42,"like inter-process communication while offloading 
other system functions to external components."
170.94,6.66,"An application example is the Eclipse IDE: its 
core runtime handles the plugin architecture,  "
177.6,5.52,"and features from Java tools to Git 
integration are delivered as plugins."
183.12,6.3,"This design prioritizes extensibility, 
ease of maintenance, and fault isolation."
189.42,4.8,"Whether it's an OS component or an 
Eclipse plugin that encounters an issue,  "
194.22,3.54,the core system remains stable and unaffected.
198.6,2.34,Then we have microservices architecture.
200.94,5.7,"This decomposes an application into a 
collection of small, loosely coupled services."
206.64,3.78,"Each service implements 
specific business capabilities,  "
210.42,4.92,"contains its own data model, 
and communicates via APIs."
216.12,1.44,"Netflix, for instance,  "
217.56,5.16,"uses microservices to handle everything 
from movie recommendations to billing."
223.32,5.76,"This architecture promotes modularization of 
functionality so services can be developed,  "
229.08,2.4,"deployed, and scaled independently."
232.02,5.76,"It increases agility, and allows companies 
like Netflix to rapidly innovate."
237.78,5.04,"The trade-off, however, is the added 
complexity in managing inter-service  "
242.82,3.12,communication and maintaining data consistency.
247.5,3.54,"Last but certainly not least, 
we have monolithic architecture."
251.04,6.6,"At its core, a monolithic design sees all 
components of the application — from data  "
257.64,4.44,"access and business logic to the 
user interface — bundled together  "
262.08,3.24,into a single codebase and run as a single unit.
266.28,2.94,"This approach simplifies 
development and deployment,  "
269.22,4.38,"making it a go-to for many 
startups and smaller applications."
274.32,3.9,"However, it's worth noting the 
rise of the 'modular monolith'."
278.22,6.18,"This approach retains the benefits of 
a single deployable unit but emphasizes  "
284.4,2.76,clear modular boundaries within the codebase.
287.16,3.24,"This allows for easier 
maintenance and scalability."
290.4,5.7,"It's a middle ground which offers the 
simplicity of a monolith while paving  "
296.1,4.74,"the way for potential future transitions 
to architectures like microservices."
301.74,6.12,"Regardless of the approach, many successful 
platforms start with a monolithic or modular  "
307.86,4.68,"monolithic structure before considering 
more distributed architectures."
313.62,5.88,"And there you have it, a quick tour of five 
foundational software architecture patterns."
319.5,6.3,"The right choice always depends on our specific 
challenges, requirements, and contexts."
