6.16,4.0,hello everyone
7.12,5.519,and welcome back to the course of dbms
10.16,3.599,in this video we will be looking into
12.639,4.241,the fundamentals
13.759,5.201,of database systems now let's go through
16.88,4.319,the outlines of this video
18.96,5.28,first we will be discussing about what a
21.199,5.361,data model is and also its categories
24.24,5.039,the first category of data model is the
26.56,4.879,high level or conceptual data model
29.279,3.28,then we have the representational or
31.439,4.161,implementation
32.559,4.721,data models and finally low level or
35.6,3.44,physical data models
37.28,3.439,and then we will be looking at few
39.04,3.12,terminologies that we need to
40.719,3.761,familiarize with
42.16,3.52,so moving on first let us see what a
44.48,3.919,data model is
45.68,4.96,and why we require it one of the most
48.399,3.281,important characteristics of database
50.64,3.84,approach is that
51.68,4.16,it provides data abstraction now what is
54.48,4.239,data abstraction
55.84,4.16,it is the hiding of complex details or
58.719,4.0,details that are not
60.0,5.04,needed by the database users now to
62.719,3.521,achieve this data abstraction we have
65.04,4.56,something called as
66.24,4.32,data model data model is a collection of
69.6,2.96,concepts
70.56,5.04,used to describe the structure of the
72.56,6.48,database like specifying the data types
75.6,6.4,constraints etc most data models
79.04,5.119,include a set of basic operations to
82.0,4.64,manipulate the data in the database
84.159,3.6,like retrieval of data from the database
86.64,3.92,or updates
87.759,4.801,on the data in the database in addition
90.56,4.879,to these basic operations
92.56,4.559,data model also includes concepts to
95.439,4.481,specify the behavior
97.119,5.68,of a database application and so it
99.92,6.559,allows the database designer to specify
102.799,5.521,a set of valid user defined operations
106.479,4.081,so this is an introduction to data
108.32,2.88,models and why we require it that is to
110.56,3.44,achieve
111.2,4.239,data abstraction now we can categorize
114.0,3.92,these data models
115.439,4.241,based on the types of concepts they use
117.92,4.799,to describe the structure of a
119.68,4.96,database the first category high level
122.719,5.04,or conceptual data model
124.64,3.44,provides concepts to present data in a
127.759,3.28,way
128.08,3.36,or that are close to the way many users
131.039,3.601,see
131.44,3.76,or perceive data the conceptual data
134.64,3.04,model
135.2,3.28,uses concepts such as entities
137.68,3.919,attributes
138.48,6.0,and relationships entities represent
141.599,3.601,real-world object or concept like for
144.48,4.0,example
145.2,5.759,employee student etc these are all
148.48,3.2,entities as they represent real-world
150.959,3.841,object
151.68,6.16,next attributes they further describe an
154.8,6.079,entity like the student name role number
157.84,5.28,etc and then we have relationships which
160.879,5.201,is an association or a link
163.12,3.759,among two or more entities like for
166.08,4.0,example
166.879,4.161,an employee works on many projects so a
170.08,3.6,relationship
171.04,3.6,exists between the employee and each
173.68,2.96,project
174.64,3.84,so this is about the first category of
176.64,3.679,data model the high level or the
178.48,4.08,conceptual data model
180.319,4.241,the next category is the low level or
182.56,4.56,the physical data model
184.56,4.8,this model provides concepts that
187.12,2.96,describe how data is stored in the
189.36,2.959,computer
190.08,3.04,by representing information like the
192.319,4.0,format
193.12,5.759,the access path etc an access
196.319,4.801,path is a structure that makes search
198.879,4.881,for a particular database record
201.12,4.64,efficient or in other words i can say
203.76,4.559,access path is a structure
205.76,4.08,for efficient searching of a particular
208.319,3.28,database record
209.84,4.08,this is the second category the low
211.599,4.761,level or the physical data model
213.92,3.92,the next category of data model is
216.36,3.959,representational or
217.84,4.0,implementation data model there are
220.319,3.521,three data models that come
221.84,3.6,under this category the first is a
223.84,3.84,relational data model
225.44,3.84,then we have the network data model and
227.68,3.839,the hierarchical model
229.28,3.44,and representational data models
231.519,3.8,represent data
232.72,4.48,using record structures and that is why
235.319,4.84,representational data models
237.2,3.84,are sometimes called record-based data
240.159,3.121,models
241.04,3.119,so these are the categories of data
243.28,3.12,models
244.159,4.561,next is the terminologies that we need
246.4,4.88,to familiarize ourselves with
248.72,3.84,the first one is database schema
251.28,3.84,database schema
252.56,5.12,is a description of a database in our
255.12,5.119,first video we have seen that metadata
257.68,4.16,is also a description of a database
260.239,3.441,now what is the difference between a
261.84,5.28,metadata and a schema
263.68,3.92,metadata is data about data or in other
267.12,3.12,words
267.6,3.76,it describes the data in the database
270.24,3.76,whereas schema
271.36,4.96,is just a plan or a layout or a
274.0,5.44,blueprint of the database
276.32,5.76,a schema is a subset of metadata or it
279.44,4.72,is one of the components of metadata
282.08,4.88,and a diagrammatic representation of
284.16,3.52,schema is called a schema diagram or in
286.96,3.36,other words
287.68,4.959,it is the displayed schema and this is
290.32,5.28,how a schema diagram would look like
292.639,3.441,and each object within the schema is
295.6,3.36,called
296.08,4.399,a schema construct like for example the
298.96,5.28,tables in the database
300.479,6.881,student course etc these are called as
304.24,3.84,schema construct a schema isn't supposed
307.36,3.279,to change
308.08,5.28,frequently but suppose if we want to add
310.639,4.161,a new data item say the date of birth to
313.36,4.48,the student schema
314.8,5.6,then that is called as schema evolution
317.84,3.68,but the data in the database can change
320.4,3.6,frequently and
321.52,3.679,so the data in the database at a
324.0,3.84,particular moment
325.199,3.28,in time or at a particular instant is
327.84,3.76,called as
328.479,6.401,a database state or an instance or
331.6,5.76,snapshot when we define a new database
334.88,3.12,the database state is empty because it
337.36,3.6,has no
338.0,4.8,data when the database is populated or
340.96,4.4,filled with the initial data
342.8,3.28,that's when we have the initial database
345.36,3.44,state
346.08,5.76,from then on once we start updating the
348.8,3.52,database we get different database state
351.84,2.639,so at
352.32,3.999,any point in time the data in the
354.479,4.481,database is the current
356.319,5.201,state of the database so these are few
358.96,4.239,other terminologies that we need to know
361.52,3.679,with this we come to the end of this
363.199,4.56,video hope you all have understood the
365.199,3.601,fundamental concepts of database systems
367.759,3.681,which includes
368.8,3.92,the data model its categories and few
371.44,9.1,terminologies
372.72,11.68,thank you
