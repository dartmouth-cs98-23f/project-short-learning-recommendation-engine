0.8,1.52,Hi my name is Will and i'm going to give  
2.32,3.2,"you a step-by-step guide to the 
data analysis process, let's go!"
8.16,4.48,"in this video we're going to go through the five 
key stages of the data analysis process we're  "
12.64,3.84,"going to give you an overview and an introduction 
to each of these stages as well as looking at some  "
16.48,5.28,"of the tools you'll use to undertake these stages 
so let's dive into step one defining the question  "
21.76,4.88,"the first step in your data analysis process 
or any data analysis process is to define your  "
26.64,5.52,"objective in data analytics terms this is called 
the problem statement defining your objective  "
32.16,5.68,"means coming up with a hypothesis and figuring 
out how exactly to test it you can start by asking  "
37.84,4.64,"what business problem am i trying to solve now i 
know this might sound straightforward but it can  "
42.48,4.88,"actually be trickier than it seems for instance 
your organization's senior management might pose a  "
47.36,5.28,"question such as why are we losing customers it's 
possible though that this doesn't get to the core  "
52.64,5.92,"of the problem a data analyst job is to understand 
the business and the business's goals as a data  "
58.56,4.24,"analyst you need to understand this in enough 
depth that they can frame the problem the right  "
62.8,4.8,"way to give you a practical example let's say you 
work for a fictional company for example we'll  "
67.6,6.08,"call it top notch learning this fictional company 
top notch creates custom training software for its  "
73.68,5.76,"clients in this example top notch is excellent 
at securing new clients but unfortunately top  "
79.44,5.92,"notch has much lower repeat business as such as a 
data analyst your question might not be why are we  "
85.36,5.84,"losing customers but which factors are negatively 
impacting the customer experience or even better  "
91.2,5.76,"yet how can we boost customer retention whilst 
minimizing costs now you've identified the problem  "
96.96,4.48,"you need to find which data is going to help 
you solve this issue this is where your business  "
101.44,4.96,"acronym comes in again for instance perhaps 
you've noticed that the sales pipeline for new  "
106.4,5.36,"customers is very slick but the production team 
is extremely inefficient knowing this you could  "
111.76,6.0,"hypothesize the sales process actually wins a lot 
of new clients but the customer experience well  "
117.76,4.64,"it's kind of lacking could this be the reason that 
customers aren't coming back what sources of data  "
122.4,4.4,"will help you answer this question as a data 
analyst considering all these things will help  "
126.8,4.56,"you define the question and help you solve the 
problem at hand there's also a number of tools  "
131.36,4.64,"that can help you define your objective defining 
your objective is mostly about soft skills so  "
136.0,4.72,"business knowledge and lateral thinking but you'll 
also need to consider business metrics and key  "
140.72,5.44,"performance indicators and these are called KPIs 
monthly reports can help you track problem points  "
146.16,4.32,"in the business there are lots of tools out there 
on the market that can analyze this business data  "
150.48,5.92,"tools like Databox and DashaRoo there's also free 
open source software like Grafana freeboard and  "
156.4,4.88,"Dashbuilder these are fantastic for producing 
simple dashboards both at the beginning and at  "
161.28,5.92,"the end of the data analysis process so that was 
step one defining the objective onto step two step  "
167.2,4.56,"two collecting the data once you've established 
your objective you'll need to create a strategy  "
171.76,4.56,"for collecting and aggregating the appropriate 
data a key part of this is determining which  "
176.32,7.28,"data you need this might be quantitative data or 
numeric data eg sales figures or monthly reports  "
183.6,5.84,"or qualitative descriptive data such as customer 
reviews all of this data fits into one of three  "
189.44,6.48,"categories first party second party and third 
party data let's explore each one briefly now  "
195.92,5.68,"what is first party data first party data is data 
that you or your company has directly collected  "
201.6,5.52,"from customers it might for example come in the 
form of transactional tracking data or information  "
207.12,4.88,"from your customer relationship management 
system your CRM system whatever it source  "
212.0,5.12,"first party data is usually collected in a clear 
and structured way other sources of first party  "
217.12,6.24,"data might include customer satisfaction surveys 
focus groups interviews or direct observation  "
223.36,4.4,"let's talk about second party data to enrich your 
analysis you might want to secure a secondary data  "
227.76,4.72,"source second party data is simply the first 
party data of other organizations this might  "
232.48,4.24,"be available directly from the company or from 
private marketplace the main benefit of second  "
236.72,3.68,"party data is that it's usually structured 
and although it's less relevant than first  "
240.4,6.24,"party data it tends to be reliable examples of 
second party data include website app or social  "
246.64,6.24,"media activity like online purchase history or 
shipping data so lastly what is third-party data  "
252.88,5.52,"third-party data is data that has been collected 
and aggregated from numerous sources from a third  "
258.4,6.24,"party often but not always third-party data 
contains a lot of unstructured data or big data  "
264.64,5.92,"many organizations collect this big data to create 
industry reports or to conduct market research the  "
270.56,4.72,"research and advisory firm Gartner is a good real 
world example of an organization that collects big  "
275.28,5.12,"data and then sells it on to other companies open 
data repositories and government portals are also  "
280.4,3.52,"sources of third third-party data let's take 
a moment to look at some of the tools that you  "
283.92,4.88,"can use to collect data once you've devised this 
data strategy ie you've identified what data you  "
288.8,4.64,"need and how best to go about collecting it there 
are many tools that you can use to help you one  "
293.44,6.24,"thing you'll need regardless of industry or area 
of expertise is a data management platform or DMP  "
299.68,5.36,"a DMP is a piece of software which allows you to 
identify and aggregate data from numerous sources  "
305.04,4.8,"before they're manipulating them segmenting them 
and so on there are many DMPs available some  "
309.84,6.64,"well-known enterprise DMPs include salesforce DMP, 
SAAS and the data integration platform Xplenty if  "
316.48,6.48,"you want to play around you can also try some open 
source platforms like Pymcore or Dswarm on to step  "
322.96,6.96,"three cleaning the data once you've collected your 
data the next step is to get it ready for analysis  "
329.92,3.68,"this means cleaning or scrubbing it and this is 
crucial to make sure that you're working with  "
333.6,6.56,"high quality data key data cleaning tasks include 
removing major errors duplicates or outliers all  "
340.16,5.04,"of which are problems when you aggregate data 
from numerous sources removing unwanted data  "
345.2,5.36,"points so extracting irrelevant observations that 
have no bearing on your intended analysis bringing  "
350.56,4.96,"structure to your data or general housekeeping 
so for example fixing typos or layout issues  "
355.52,4.96,"which will help you map or manipulate your data 
more easily and finally it helps filling in major  "
360.48,4.32,"gaps as you're tidying up you might notice that 
important data is missing once you've identified  "
364.8,5.28,"these gaps you can go about filling them a good 
data analyst will spend about 70 to 90 of their  "
370.08,5.44,"time cleaning data this might sound excessive but 
focusing on the wrong data or analyzing error in  "
375.52,5.28,"this data will severely impact your results it 
might even send you back to square one so whatever  "
380.8,3.92,"you do don't rush this step let's have a look 
at some of the tools that you can use to clean  "
384.72,6.24,"your data cleaning data manually especially large 
data sets can be incredibly daunting but luckily  "
390.96,5.36,"there are many tools available to streamline this 
process open source tools such as open refine are  "
396.32,5.92,"excellent for basic data cleaning as well as high 
level exploration however free tools offer limited  "
402.24,5.28,"functionality for very large data sets now i know 
this sounds like a data zoo but python libraries  "
407.52,5.84,"such as pandas and some r packages are better 
suited to heavy data scrubbing you will of course  "
413.36,5.28,"need to be savvy with languages alternatively 
enterprise tools are also available for example  "
418.64,4.8,"data ladder which is one of the highest rated data 
matching tools in the industry there are many more  "
423.44,4.32,"why don't you see which data cleaning tools you 
can find online share your free tools in the  "
427.76,5.6,"comments below so that was step three cleaning 
the data on to step four analyzing that data  "
433.36,4.88,"finally once you've cleaned your data now comes 
the fun bit analyzing it the type of data analysis  "
438.24,5.44,"you conduct largely depends on what your goal is 
but there are many techniques available univariate  "
443.68,5.28,"or bivariate analysis time series analysis and 
regression analysis are just a few you might  "
448.96,4.4,"have heard of more important than the different 
types though is how you apply them this depends  "
453.36,4.64,"on what types of insights you're hoping to gain 
broadly speaking all types of data analysis fit  "
458.0,4.64,"into the four following categories descriptive 
analysis which is analysis which identifies what  "
462.64,4.72,"has already happened this is a common first step 
that companies do before proceeding with deeper  "
467.36,4.72,"explorations diagnostic analysis where the focus 
is on understanding why something has happened  "
472.08,4.8,"it is literally the diagnosis of a problem just 
as a doctor uses the symptoms to diagnose the  "
476.88,5.68,"patient's disease predictive analysis which is 
where you identify future trends by the analysis  "
482.56,5.2,"of historical data predictive analysis is commonly 
used by businesses to forecast future growth and  "
487.76,3.6,"lastly prescriptive analysis which allows 
you to make recommendations for the future  "
491.36,4.72,"this is the final step in the analytics part 
of the process but it's also the most complex  "
496.08,4.88,"this is because it incorporates aspects of all 
the other analyses that we've described today  "
500.96,4.96,"step 5 sharing your results you've finished 
carrying out your analyses you have your insights  "
505.92,5.2,"the final step of a data analysis process is to 
share these insights with the wider world or at  "
511.12,4.48,"least with your organization's stakeholders this 
is actually more complex than just sharing the raw  "
515.6,4.64,"results of your work it involves interpreting the 
outcomes and presenting them in a manner which is  "
520.24,4.72,"digestible to everybody that's in the room since 
you'll also present your work to decision makers  "
524.96,5.2,"it's very important that the insights that you 
share are 100 clear and also unambiguous for  "
530.16,5.04,"this reason data analysts usually use reports 
dashboards and interactive visualizations to  "
535.2,4.48,"support their findings how you interpret and 
present results will often influence the direction  "
539.68,4.72,"of the business depending on what you share 
your organization might decide to restructure to  "
544.4,5.44,"launch a new product or close an entire division 
that's why it's very important to present all the  "
549.84,4.64,"evidence that you gathered and not to cherry-pick 
data ensuring that you cover everything in a clear  "
554.48,5.36,"and concise way will prove that your conclusions 
are scientifically sound and based on facts on the  "
559.84,4.8,"flip side it's important to highlight any gaps 
in the data or to flag any insights that might  "
564.64,5.12,"be open to interpretation remember that honest 
communication is an important part of the process  "
569.76,4.64,"it will help the business but it will also help 
you to excel at your job there's a ton of tools  "
574.4,4.88,"for interpreting and sharing your findings these 
tools are suited to different experience levels  "
579.28,6.32,"but popular tools that require no coding skills 
include Google Charts, Tableau, Datawrapper and  "
585.6,4.56,"Infogram if you're familiar with python and 
r there are also many data visualization  "
590.16,5.12,"libraries and packages available for instance 
check out the Python libraries Plotty, Seaborn  "
595.28,5.6,"and Matplotlib whichever data visualization 
tools you use make sure that you polish up your  "
600.88,5.52,"presentation skills too visualization is great 
but communication is key so hopefully now you  "
606.4,4.8,"have a better idea of the data analysis process
