0.31,3.77,What's up guys I need three minutes on this one just because there's so much information
4.12,1.639,So time has gone
5.759,7.289,So human-computer interaction comes from a book in the 80s and it was about it was called the psychology of human-computer interaction
13.049,5.16,I'm gonna leave a link in the description and you probably come to this video because you may be thinking about studying
18.55,5.69,human-computer interaction or HCI and what effectively that is is it's the psychology of
24.85,6.949,Interaction between humans and computers. So I am a practicing UX designer and UX actually is
32.5,6.559,the wider spectrum human-computer action is a part of that and so is graphic design and then there's other things like
39.309,2.0,industrial design like the actual
41.35,6.41,Physical design of the device so UX is I guess it's all the jobs are called
47.76,4.86,It's it's just the practice in version of ACI. HCI is a form of M
52.62,4.919,I guess it's it's studyin and it specifically studying the interaction between humans and computers
57.91,6.109,So because computers have a dialogue with people and it's not like just a hammer that you use and you use it
64.019,4.56,"However, it kind of feeds back. There's a lot of psychology that goes on so"
69.939,3.35,The study of human-computer interaction is really understanding
74.59,4.25,the psychology of the person using the device and there's lots of different ways you can I
79.45,3.59,Guess you can affect the psychology of someone using and that might be okay
83.68,3.379,Just making things simple. So people like using the product but
87.64,4.79,"in my opinion, there's parts of graphic design which come into HCI so that could be"
93.13,3.5,Like the type of images they use that affects people's psychology
96.82,2.509,So when Obama was doing his campaign
99.329,4.319,they did lots of a B test about the type of images that he used on his website to get people to sign up and
103.649,6.03,They found that maybe color ones work better than black and white ones in this whole article about our link to in the description
110.17,3.229,So that's interesting to the whole psychology around there
113.399,5.31,then there is of a bit of a typography all these bits work into HCI and
119.02,5.0,So what I found there's a found a couple of great resources for you. I'm going to leave a link in the description
124.02,1.72,So I found the best
125.74,4.909,Colleges and universities in America that do HCI and you might want to check them out
130.709,2.669,I've also got a free course on my website a better self
133.93,4.86,so it takes about an hour you learn all the basics of UX design which HCI is a part of and
139.609,5.69,That's linked in the description as well and I'll leave a link to the original book from the 80s
145.299,3.96,So I think hates you guys moved on from the 80s its moved on to your ex design
149.989,2.66,because actually there's other things than just the
154.159,4.55,One-on-one interaction between the pet and advice these things like sound and there's I think
158.87,5.059,"Aesthetics is really really important the way you know, Apple made the devices feel nice they made"
164.569,2.0,kind of like luxury products
167.12,7.639,With the Braun reinvented the way products were designed and I'd say that's actually part of the human-computer interaction. Not just the actual interface
175.459,6.41,"Design, a lot of people ask what's best to study is it I studied graphic design is a graphic designer human-computer interaction"
181.989,2.52,I think graphic design is great because you can
185.569,6.979,Write x Don so graphic design is great because you can apply all of those all of those graphic design theories apply to computers
192.799,2.27,But human-computer interactions great
195.069,5.97,if you just want to focus on the side column or a cycle like psychological bits the research bets the
201.59,3.289,The juicy bits of understand and how people interactive computers
204.879,4.259,"I hope that lesson made sense guys, if you think of it as a way, it's much alike and"
209.84,4.519,"Subscribe, I'm trying to grow this channel as fast as I can. Make sure you check out the resources. There's some great"
215.18,4.91,"Resources are in the description. Actually, there's a course. I'm linking from the University of San Diego"
220.4,3.32,"Which is free and it's like 11 months, so it's a great resource"
223.72,2.849,If you want to do some free online training check out my course
226.569,1.151,there's loads of their
227.72,5.72,Students on there now and you might meet some friends and learn a few things along the way and until next time keep designing
