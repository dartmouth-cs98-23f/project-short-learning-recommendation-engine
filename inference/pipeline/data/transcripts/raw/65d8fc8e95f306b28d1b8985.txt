when it comes to ai machine learning and
deep learning
there is some confusion as to what these
words mean and the differences between
them
so in this video we will explain what ai
means and how to differentiate between
these three terms
so what is artificial intelligence in
the broader sense of the word
artificial intelligence refers to a
machine that is made to simulate human
consciousness
when the average person thinks of ai
they imagine robots that can
see move speak think and possibly even
feel the way humans do for some
the ultimate goal of ai research is to
create a sentient conscious being
through programming
sometimes this is also referred to as
artificial general intelligence
however in practice most data scientists
are using ai at a smaller more practical
scale to solve real-world problems
such as data analysis manufacturing and
customer service
in that sense ai is the umbrella term
for technology that solves
problems autonomously by simulating
human intelligence
they do this through algorithms designed
to analyze input data and produce an
output
using chatbots for example the input
data would be the customer's inquiry
and the output would be the answer to
the customer's inquiry held within the
chatbots database
what's more amazing is that ai
algorithms can react to input data in
various forms
[Music]
a great example is how you would ask a
virtual assistant like amazon
alexa or google assistant for the
weather report there are multiple ways
that you can phrase that query
for example what's the weather what's
the temperature or even how's the
weather looking
but by picking up on certain keywords
the virtual assistant can respond to all
these different variants
the current weather is 23 degrees
celsius with clear skies
so if that's the definition of ai then
how is machine learning different
well machine learning is generally
considered to be a subset of ai
however it's pretty common to hear the
two terms used interchangeably
one major difference is that while ai
still encompasses the idea of a sentient
conscious machine
machine learning as a term does not hold
those connotations
ai is the grand vision of intelligent
machines while machine learning consists
of the models
processes and supporting technology that
we've been using to get there
diving a bit deeper now within machine
learning is another sector known as deep
learning
in a nutshell deep learning is machine
learning at the largest scale
involving millions of instances of
training data and often multiple layers
within the neural network
as computing power and access to
training data has increased
researchers have been able to develop
machine learning models on a larger
scale than ever before
eventually this led to the use of a new
term deep learning
to fully understand its meaning it's
essential to first know a little bit
about neural networks
simply a neural network is a collection
of algorithms designed to take in data
and find a solution with the least
amount of error they are called neural
networks because the design of the nodes
inputs and outputs which slightly
resemble that of a neuron in the human
brain
the key differentiator between machine
learning and deep learning is in the
number of
layers of nodes that the input data
passes through
in the past it was only possible to
connect a few layers of nodes
due to simple computing limitations
however as
technology has improved it has become
possible to build deeper neural networks
with more hidden layers
this is the kind of model the data
scientists mean when they talk about
deep learning
to sum things up ai is the grand
all-encompassing vision of intelligent
machines and machine learning is the
processes and tools that are getting us
there
finally deep learning is machine
learning at the largest scale with more
sophisticated neural networks
exponentially larger data sets and
stronger computing power supporting it
with this in mind it's possible to begin
navigating through this complex exciting
field
and figuring out which processes will
help to build out your own project
