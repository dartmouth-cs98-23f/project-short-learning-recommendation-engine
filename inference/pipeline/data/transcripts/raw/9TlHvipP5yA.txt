0.03,5.4,welcome that I relate few pieces of code
3.389,3.72,and show you how to analyze them how to
5.43,4.41,find out the time complexity for them
7.109,4.681,this is a simple loop I am not reading a
9.84,3.9,complete algorithm I have this written a
11.79,3.9,piece of code in which one statement is
13.74,4.02,there but we are already familiar with
15.69,5.07,this one we know that this will execute
17.76,7.05,for n plus 1 9 and this way is good for
20.76,6.179,and we don't want this time because
24.81,4.59,anyway when we are at the order of be
26.939,4.291,writing a degree so this will not affect
29.4,3.659,the degree at all so it will be same
31.23,3.93,only so just you need to move the
33.059,7.951,statement how many times it is executed
35.16,13.98,so that's it so this is order of n you
41.01,11.4,can avoid this one skip this one next if
49.14,7.8,suppose this loop starting from N and
52.41,8.37,the condition is greater than 1 or 0 and
56.94,8.46,this was getting subtracted so this loop
60.78,7.53,is decrementing then also this statement
65.4,6.87,will execute for n times and it sort of
68.31,7.169,in whether you go from one to ten ten
72.27,6.209,steps or come from ten to one then also
75.479,5.581,ten steps so you go from one to ten or
78.479,7.131,ten to one signal process so that's how
81.06,7.699,n to 0 at us so it's also all wrong and
85.61,6.73,if this is starting from one and
88.759,8.891,condition is less than N and I is being
92.34,8.069,incremented by 2 so this statement will
97.65,8.429,not repeat for ten times but half of the
100.409,11.161,end times and by two if it is n by 2
106.079,8.371,also if I say function s and by 2 what
111.57,5.009,is the degree of polynomial and only
114.45,6.57,search part of n again
116.579,8.761,so in this case also it sort of end even
121.02,6.9,if it is incrementing by 20 then this is
125.34,5.88,20 degree of a polynomial is and
127.92,6.21,so resolves forever friend so end by
131.22,5.37,anything this whatever the number of
134.13,4.11,times it is implementing the time will
136.59,4.02,be same
138.24,6.15,nice we are already familiar with this
140.61,6.09,one these are two loops nested loop one
144.39,6.03,inside another and this we know this
146.7,6.18,relates q4 n times so this is also n
150.42,5.01,times and resolves right times actually
152.88,4.59,is n plus 1 but what about this one
155.43,5.4,again this is repeat for n plus 1 times
157.47,8.12,and so they before any time and this is
160.83,9.18,all rough and squared
165.59,6.55,the next is again nested for loop this
170.01,6.03,looks similar to the previous one but
172.14,7.38,not see I did travel 0 I less than n but
176.04,6.66,G takes value G less than I so here is a
179.52,5.61,defense so let us analyze this by
182.7,5.73,tracing this one and find out how much
185.13,8.06,time it is checking so for this I will
188.43,10.95,take I value and J value and paste them
193.19,8.92,let us start initially I is 0 when I 0 J
199.38,5.16,starts from 0 and 0 less than 0
202.11,5.189,no it will not execute for any number of
204.54,5.28,times so here I have to find out how
207.299,5.881,many times the statement is executed so
209.82,7.199,number of times so it will not execute
213.18,8.67,at all so 0 times then this loop ends
217.019,7.171,again I am plus plus I becomes 1 I is
221.85,6.0,less than n in suppose it's enters
224.19,10.59,inside then again this group 0 0 is less
227.85,9.359,than 9 yes then J plus plus J is 1 1 is
234.78,4.47,not less than I so for 1 it will not
237.209,8.101,execute so how many times it has
239.25,10.53,executed one time and then goes up again
245.31,7.5,I plus plus I becomes 2 then J will
249.78,7.86,execute for 0 1 and when it becomes 2 it
252.81,10.47,will stop so this will be 4 2 times and
257.64,8.43,when I is the 3 J will take 0 1 2 & 3 so
263.28,3.69,this will be 4 3 times and this process
266.07,3.75,continues
266.97,5.73,see when I was 0 it was never executed
269.82,4.26,when I was 1 it was executed for one
272.7,3.96,time this is statement
274.08,6.57,I was true it was a spirit for two time
276.66,9.24,three rate and so on so on up to what
280.65,8.579,and so total when it is n right how many
285.9,6.48,times this will execute n times when I
289.229,5.341,was three so three times so if it is
292.38,5.01,reaching till n actually it is less than
294.57,5.67,n but let us say m is reaching till 10
297.39,8.36,so it will execute for 10 times so total
300.24,5.51,how many times it is executed this one
307.07,5.89,right so I am assuming that it is going
309.93,6.9,till then no it is not didn't this less
312.96,7.32,than n times 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus goes
316.83,3.98,on to and this is nothing but n into n
320.28,7.1,person
320.81,10.62,by 2 what is the degree of this one F of
327.38,10.71,n as n square plus 1 by 2
331.43,9.47,Davy's square so all Roth and square for
338.09,5.19,the time complexity is order of n square
340.9,4.48,though this is not similar to the
343.28,5.04,previous one but if you're analyzed
345.38,4.56,answer is coming 2 and square only the
348.32,5.61,degree of the polynomial is n square
349.94,6.18,only next for is here
353.93,5.64,Beasley's rest with you and as a loop
356.12,6.63,does not get very good for n times C the
359.57,5.55,speed P is less than equal to n it's not
362.75,4.89,a less than equal to n so the condition
365.12,5.43,is different then what is P P is
367.64,5.22,initially 0 and every time I is added to
370.55,3.77,P so now we don't know how many times
372.86,6.0,it's going to execute
374.32,8.7,let us analyze I will take I value and B
378.86,7.44,value initially this is 0 and this is 1
383.02,6.25,so what happens first time this one is
386.3,6.06,added and it becomes 1 the next time it
389.27,6.18,will be do so it will be 1 plus 2 so it
392.36,6.809,will be 3 then next time I will be 3 and
395.45,7.1,this will be 1 plus 2 Plus 3 then idle
399.169,9.631,before it will be 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4
402.55,9.04,goes on how many times it's going to
408.8,8.91,execute it's going to execute for K
411.59,10.829,times so what this will be 1 plus 2 Plus
417.71,7.47,3 plus 4 plus goes on to K time my hope
422.419,5.851,K here is not reaching it is not
425.18,5.489,repeating for n times definitely it is
428.27,3.39,red waiting for some number of times so
430.669,3.211,that we don't know
431.66,5.009,we are sure that it still not execute
433.88,3.559,for n times this how many times because
436.669,3.68,the conditions
437.439,6.27,so I said let it be came and let us find
440.349,7.71,out that came so if it is repeating for
443.709,8.04,K times then what is the tradition we
448.059,6.42,are seeing that P has became greater
451.749,6.361,than M so when P became greater than n
454.479,5.131,it is stopping we assume this as long as
458.11,3.569,E is less than equal to n it is
459.61,8.029,repeating so when P becomes greater than
461.679,13.29,n it is stopping right since P is what
467.639,10.721,CP see it is getting to k plus 1 by 2 P
474.969,8.34,is akin to k plus 1 by 2 so what's the
478.36,9.419,condition K mu K plus 1 by 2 is greater
483.309,6.63,than n so when it will stop when k k
487.779,7.8,plus 1 by 2 has became greater than n
489.939,14.79,it'll stop so what is K roughly as limit
495.579,12.59,as K square so what is K gains and K is
504.729,10.62,a root n so this loop will execute for
508.169,10.72,order of n times let me show you quickly
515.349,6.271,I assignment 1 I P is less than equal to
518.889,5.01,n I dismiss this is not I less than
521.62,6.839,equal to n so we don't know how many
523.899,7.141,times it is repeating II's here P is
528.459,6.12,here so either these are incrementing
531.04,5.43,and every time I is added to P so we
534.579,4.921,don't know how many times so let us say
536.47,13.619,K times and this will be 1 plus 2 plus 2
539.5,13.019,K well so that K s P is gain k plus 1 by
550.089,4.211,2 now so we know that this was repeated
552.519,3.581,as long as P is less than equal to
554.3,3.84,so if you'll stop then P becomes greater
556.1,4.02,than n so then P becomes greater than n
558.14,4.68,if it stops okay and keep us on white
560.12,7.29,goo becomes greater than it will stop so
562.82,6.26,this is K Square and K is okay in the
567.41,5.67,next video we'll find more examples
569.08,5.32,right so different type of course I will
573.08,4.77,show you and I'll show you how to
574.4,5.4,analyze them so this is all by tracing
577.85,4.11,you canonized n so in the other video
579.8,5.33,next video also you can find few more
581.96,3.17,algorithms that the Tracy
