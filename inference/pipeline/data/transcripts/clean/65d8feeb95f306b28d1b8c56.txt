games there yay computationally game theory is what were doing today the news of the day is actually a little bit old dated but still relevant checkers this incredibly wonderfully large powerful game that Ive played as a kid many who play checkers as a kid gives about solved solve do you like what does that mean I will tell you in this section what solve means what it means for Jonathan Schafer and University of Alberta is that he proved he weakly solved checkers which means he proved if two perfect opponents are playing to God who floating in the in the heavens and theyre playing checkers its only one God okay well Ill do Im gonna talk outs whatever so if theyre to duplicate himself and now that God prisons up and now there always be a draw meaning that these both omniscient entities who knew the entire game tree no one would be able to cause the other one to lose it would buddy draw every single time thats really cool and they proved it they dont necessarily have a path for every possible game thats the difference from what I do and well talk about that later bets he weakly solved it which means he proved it but didnt necessarily have the answer for every game I have the answer for every game and well show you some demos that do that so today were talking about computational game theory and this is what the lecture topic is little history definitions so were on the same page and then Ill show you some demos viewing system that Ive built ok so a high up sky level view ten-mile up view of computer sciences there are these sub pieces of computer science and you saw human-computer interaction and next Monday youre gonna hear a lecture from one of our outstanding young graduate student instructors whos going to talk to you about the whole field of artificial intelligence one of the coolest fields of coming up Siri you talk to your phone thats AI and theres a thousand other things that are AI that generally self-driving cars that say are some of the coolest applications that are happening today our AI and shes gonna try to summarize the entire field a very big task but shes up to it so theres all these fields of of computer science and AI is one of them and computational game theory falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence so similar to what you saw it we go to see in a week from now so you actually its great the Bjorn talked about the Mechanical Turk and so this is the original Mechanical Turk so this was a a mechanical device in which there was a master level player who hid and when the like the magician who said nobody in here nobody in here he would like move and so it looked like it was an empty box when they showed the players and it turns out theres a person under there who had a magnet to see what the board is above and had a little arm an armature that could control the arm 17:70 people they still pooping outdoors and theyre getting a chess-playing robot like what are you kidding me like how many theres like centuries in the future right its like a time machine in todays day uh how does that come here so it played a strong game of chess can you believe it this mechanical this mechanical robot toured Europe and blew people away that this thing could play like how did were they inventing nowadays right and turns out that they challenged Napoleon now Napoleon somebody I would guess if he got challenged and got embarrassed he might not take too kindly to being embarrassed so Im pretty impressed they challenged a Polina and beat Napoleon but they played Benjamin Franklin two people defeated all of them unfortunately so the idea of this Mechanical Turk is and this is why this name continues today is it looks like its a machine doing it but its really humans and thats how they have the Amazon Mechanical Turk idea where you can as a human do jobs it looks like the machines doing it like transcribing a lecture you know the words of audio file but in fact the people are doing it the work thats where this came from see the purpose persons doing their work looks like the machine got that idea unfortunately it burned in a fire but they recover the chess board because the chess board had been stored separately so they saved that but its kind of cool its kind of a shame that they lost the original thing were going the history of game theory this is Claude Shannon one of the founders of signal processing founders of information theory a famous person remember the name I often in my exams I often ask you who was Claude Shannon so make a little circle for yourself to remember who Claude Shannon was hes an important person in our field the double eat there are many fields in the EE side the electric inside of our department in which Claude Shannon is the old the father of that entire field right its pretty powerful guy so impressive guy he wrote a paper in 1950 that was the seminal work for all computing AI chess-playing programs can can get go back to their origins of that work so he set the foundation of what you what you had to do to create a chess-playing program and all of the current AI programs that play chess well go back to his early work in this incredible guy in fact he has something called a Shannon number which is the number of chess positions and thats a really huge number so thats kind of cool and mathematicians and theoretical and try to get that to be a more refined number and thats a cool thing let me give you a cool historical sense this is like who remembers when this happened heres the thing Wow like three this is such a big deal for the for the field of AI let me just set the context up till 1997 chess-playing programs had never beaten a human Grandmaster in a six-game match they had beaten them in a one-off little you know lets do a thing for charity and then oh the computer wins big deal but the computer here but the humans that always said you challenged us to a six-game match and theres no way a program which doesnt have the insight that we do will ever win because humans have intuition where they can limit their search space that ignore massive parts of the board because they know you know if theres a queen and the king and another queen over here in the corner thats where the action is so thats where the next moves will in their mind will go to 20 moves deep incredible 20 moves deep in their head they can see where the computers dont know that and the early computers didnt know that so theyre searching everything theyre going oh what if I hit the Queen against the wall bonk bonk bonk is that a good thing and then I dont know that you dont hit the Queen against the wall thats silly so okay 1996 so heres the heres the history NSYNC its a really amazing thing and by theres a video for this I encourage you all to find this video its on the YouTube there it says deep blue beats garry kasparov 1997 but Im going to summarize it because I think I do better job today okay so heres the idea in 96 the first game is a six-game match and with every time you win you get a point if you tie its half and half okay so its at a total of a purse purse purse first person to after six games has the most points wins okay so the first game that deep blue wins is a classic in 96 okay so 96 days IBM thinks well we think we have with all the parallel processing theyve built a custom machine custom architecture custom hardware to play chess and do nothing but play chess and it was called deep blue and they challenged Garry Kasparov then the best pretty clearly known as the best player in the world to play chess so deep blue plays this incredible game Game one and wins its like it still talked about wow that game the deep blue versus Kasparov incredible game like the insight that deep blue saw this really there wasnt much insight and there was a little bit of Ill explain how it works theres an opening book at this some grandmasters head gave given to it but most of its searched most was just brute-force search of different positions in chess okay deep blue loses game three and draws to to lose the six-game match four to two so what that means is they were right humans were right that youre never gonna beat a human in a six-game match but it came close four to two is really close so ACM who is the kind of umbrella organization for computing and IBM say how about hey Garry Kasparov how about a rematch next year and Kasparov says you know certainly in a grandiose way lets do it slaps the handshake BAM Ill see you at the same time next year IBM goes to work and goes crazy and what they do is they study every single one of Kasparov games he ever played Kasparov normally was gonna play faced an opponent will study all the other person other opponents games Ive ever played but guess what deep blue had never played games it only played those six games so Casper Ive had nothing to work from of the style he was going to encounter so they work and they add even more grandmasters adding all of their brilliance to the mix so now its 1997 again humans had never been beaten it was like the last you know computers are fastest and how many better than us at how many things calculation search tax query all the things but it hadnt like its kind of like the shores are coming up and we put a big big fortress and sandbags as you cant touch chess theres the human about chess you cant touch it well they shouldnt have done that because in 97 IBM comes back with deeper blue not deep blue deeper like were gonna search even deeper into the tree so deeper blue very clever name Kasparov wins Game one and heres the key game - he was winning and he could have won but he thinks they did something wrong so he resigns it but in fact the analysis of it was that it should have been a tie or at least he should have won it so he should have I think he should have been a tie okay not a win shouldve been a tie but he lost so now Kasparov wins one loses one now theyre tied one-one right the tied one-one now they draw the next three games three four five so now its all tied going into Game six who knows baseball metaphors its like you know tie game bottom of the ninth bases loaded full count you know the whole drama right its on one game all of humanity rests on one game do you understand how this is how this the pressure and like the fame and it was on ESPN it was a big deal Kasparov the pressure got to him I think hes the greatest player in the history that I know of move seven normally the game is to us how to move fifteen twenty thirty right move seven which is still in your opening book still the set of moves that you normally have pre-recorded in your head but IBM came out with a little twist and Kasparov messes up and move seven and by by a couple moves later he knows its over so he loses in nineteen moves which is like a blowout and what was it as he lost he lost in the biggest way you could possibly lose to a computer like like that like Skynet had come online and now the computers had taken one more step toward taking away our humanity and they made a whole big drama of this how the how now chess which used to be a the bastion of only humans the computers owned that - what else dont they own right youll get the feeling that what else dont computers own right a little bit it was the bit it was a defining moment in AI history when they beat Kasparov in that six-game match is an incredible drama behind that and theyve never looked back theyve gotten only stronger and stronger stronger compute hardwares faster and faster and faster so now on my laptop I have software thats as good as deeper blue was back then custom machine Im not just my laptop anybodys laptop like the computer hardware is fast enough now that you can have that youre just normal system that you play at home is as good as this thing that beat Kasparov its incredible what theyve done ok its about how much you weve advanced in our hardware since 97 and its also incredible that its no longer even a question you cant be human you paint you cant be computers anymore were sorry okay they just dont lose you cannot a human cannot beat them thats the feeling or can they game theory is three different pieces on this campus if you say hey you game theory youre probably going to be in the right column economic game theory an economic game theory is the Department of Economics has people who have won Nobel prizes in game theory so thats usually what they mean that means like an auction or a prisoners dilemma if youve heard of that basically simultaneous moves the goal is maximizing profit very economic right combinatorial game theory is a small subset of computational game theory which is board games like the kind you played it at home okay board games - player board games with no chance thats basically what were thinking about here theres a small subset that are really cool and really powerful in which you win by getting the last move and thats a really special thing and thats it so theres a small little subset of that but for the most part most of the board games you solve we have to solve with computer horsepower which is why we call it computational game theory or solving board games with computer horsepower which is what I do thats the center guy okay so what board games do you mean well board games that have complete information that is both players have all the information needs to have for that game and theres no chance so theres no dice and no cards any game you have a dice and cards sorry its out cant come into them cant cant cant play but everything else is in there so go chess checkers not backgammon because thats dice tic-tac-toe Im hundred others five in a row connect four fellow reverse I Chinese checkers Chinese chess all those things are games that youd have to use computer horsepower to solve okay and the game can it anyway doesnt have to end with getting a last move as convert or game theory is this is the only math you have to have thats the only part thats a little hard for this the rest was just kind of expositional and tell you how this stuff works so for every position in the game that is every snapshot of the board including whose turn it is on the board so Ill give you a photograph that says heres what the board looks like and heres whose turn it is its white to play or its red to play or its blue to play theres one of four categories of positions its really simple from the person whose turn it is from the point of view of the persons turn is remember the bottom of the board it says wipe to play so that means for the white player it is either winning which means there exists to move youre assuming always alternating play in this kind of simple game there exists to move a winning move the winning by the way is green there exists a winning move which yields a losing child for you okay this is recursively defined by the way you know you guys know recursion so you can understand this a losing move is one in which all the moves are losing therefore all the moves that you do yield a winning for the other person so theres nothing you can do youre kind of in a corner nothing you can have no way out at I move is one in which there does not exist a winning green guy but there does exist a tie and ties better than losing so youll take the time move rather than take the losing move so you ignore these bad losing moves on the left of the tie and take the time ooh because thats the best thing you can do and the draw is one in which the game can go on forever like two kings just move it around forever and neither of them can force a move a win or you force the opponent to lose for that okay we care about remoteness also which is how long until the game is over like maton three they would say remoteness is three okay so thats something so I lead a research group and Im really proud that weve had tons of students who have contribute to this codebase and we now have 70 games and puzzles in our system and we strongly solve our art we strongly solve our games and strongly solve means we salt we know the value and were all done we know the win lose tired draw value for every single position ever in that game its not just in that particular path but its for any game ever I know the answer unlike sweetly solving where theyve proved it but they dont actually know for every position I know for position thats a big distinction you should make okay so lets go see what do you mean by strongly solved an so lets go see a video so the movie wargames the whopper computer runs amok and starts to try to decode the encrypted key to the missile launch codes if it gets all ten digits it launches the missile and they decide to teach the computer go back to view they decide to teach the computer if I can have the computer play tic-tac-toe and learn that tic-tac-toe it doesnt matter how you start you cant win maybe it will extrapolate that thermal global nuclear nuclear war is like that its a tie game you cant win it all does matter who goes first okay doesnt matter when its first strike or second strike youre gonna lose war same as you would never be able to win tic-tac-toe okay it hasnt learned is there Im going to make it play itself yes number of players zero damnit eight assistant kindly called sack get me in launch status report late today give me the president yes sir make that ground faster all landlines out of the mountain theyre dead Im trying to break through all the satellites okay learning and so I leave that in there and pause that because what is he saying to play what is that what do you conclude now about chess either too big to solve which is the right answer or he might be implicitly saying that chess is not a tie game and if hes really smart if the computer is very smart it has solved it and its going first which means its giving itself the advantage and its gonna win the game always so it depends whether you read into this through the script whether its not-its implying that it solved it or implying that its hasnt solved it its still fun to do because its too big to solve it is to be to solve by the way so how does weakly solving a game different from strongly solving a game in the weekly version heres how it works the game space is too massive the reason Jonathan Schafer didnt strongly solve checkers not because Im smarter than him but he didnt do it is because checkers is too big checkers is way too big too strongly solve to get to all the dots in there imagine is a big vessel and up and down and the y-axis is the number of pieces on the board you start 24 pieces on the board and you end with 0 or 1 but one actually in that one case and so what it does is it the way he and everybody else who does weak solving they do a bottom-up search you start with all the possible positions for one piece on the board we need like you just made a move and then you back up and say what if its one at one versus one and what if its two verses one and two versus two and you keep backing your way up okay so youre kind of filling the vessel completely you go through every possible combination of having those pieces so youre strongly solving the bottom of the search space the end games okay they do this in chess by the way they strongly solve the end games and you can now download a chess endgame database which has all the possible perfect play for now six pieces and fewer and I think even they have a seven piece endgame database available and then what he does is start from the top and kind of have a search thing which says well what if you did this so my I do this and then what if you do this I do this until you get down to the endgame and you say okay I know the answer is there I dont think searching below that so you basically saving time by doing that so you have these workers in parallel trying all these combinations in order to try to prove that the game is a tie or a win or lose and they were successfully able to do that with checkers so they didnt visit a whole vast number of positions in their search space which is really cool and they will look do that in such an elegant way to kind of sample the search space in the appropriate way to prove that its a drop ok so lets actually do that right now for a game and this is always where the people who are really paid in to get this ok focus for a second this is a game Im going to teaching you right now ready go the goal is to player game the sum the shared some starts at 0 this is a 0 ducks are on the table and on your turn you can add one or you can add two ducks to the table the person at the end of their turn who after making their move looks at the table and theres perfect ten ducks in a row that person wins so the person that makes the total ten wins and all you can do is add one or two to the current running total ok so thats an example so anna starts with 0 says ill add 2 to make it two ducks ok Bob says Ill add one to make it three ducks and it says oh Ill add two to make it five bob says two to make it seven so you say this is how much Im adding to make it the sum and thats the photo if seven ducks in a row after Bobs move and it says oh Im gonna win one to make it eight and back was ah two to make it 10 and Bob wins cuz Bob made it 10 does that make sense okay so I want you to tell me is that is one the game was called by the one to ten because you can say one or two and the goal is to ten okay so is one to ten a first player win in which if you go first you can always win our first player lose in which if you played against a perfect player youd always lose going first or is it a tie or is it a draw so yeah sure right whats your name says I said you win if you go first is it Daniel do you think ah lose go first now it isnt necessarily what you did but youre kind of stepping back to see like what would the perfect person do what would a perfect player do okay so who wants to argue whoo yes right in the back well thats interesting whats your name tad well done how did how did you come up with that its true if you hit seven no matter what you do you can always guarantee when I say you hit it means you give the other person seven right right you know what I say you take seven it means that I make a move to get to seven but then its their turn with seven in front of them thats what I mean so its if youre looking at the board its your turn in at seven then that means seven is bad Im hearing right so seven is bad because you dont want to have seven to start from because if I have seven whatever I do if I say one you say two to make it ten if I said to do you say want to make it ten so seven is bad why seven bad because 10 is bad whats 10 if its my turn in its tendon I win or lose I lost because the other person got to 10 the action is getting to 10 is the winning thing so if Im sitting to 10 I got a big goose egg here so 10 is a losing position why is 7 also losing because its the one its you can always guarantee to get from 7 to 10 if you have 7 I can give you if I if I give you 7 I can arrow to give you guarantee to give you 10 and whats that theres 3 apart and you back up that means that 4 is losing therefore 1 is losing exactly right well done tad all right is that cool so it is the case that one is losing therefore 0 which is the game is winning and whats the winning move one go first and say one now your opponent has the losing goose egg of one and theyre also going to have the four theyre also gonna have this 7 then also you have the 10 which means youve got to 10 and you won isnt that cool good stuff right so you guys strongly solved one to ten isnt that cool so now you can all first on a you could always beat your friends thats kind of cool right hey lets play one to ten let me go first one right and you all whats the perfect strategy by the way can you summarize this strategy into a couple of words need to make a big table of if you have this and I do an instant if you have this I did it I mean is it the table based solution or what you might have like a way to kind of summarize that somehow how do you get yeah go back you make thats exemption aim Evan everyone exactly right you make the total between you and your opponent three which is to say you say the opposite of them you say one I say - you say - I say one thats three always so in one sentence go first say one and then say opposite you will always win that game isnt that cool so you strongly solved it and thats the solution and that solution was really beautiful because you could summarize it in one sentence how about chess chess maybe a win but you certainly are gonna be able to sell statisti to summarize a solution in one sentence right maybe add tie who knows maybe a draw so heres a game tic-tac-toe whos played tic-tac-toe before okay whos played misere tic-tac-toe before in which is their french word in game 3 parlance what it means is whatever was the win or lose is the opposite now so if three in a row were a win which it is for tic-tac-toe three in a row is now Ill lose so three row is now bad three turnout is now poison you know what three in a row all the strategies you grew up practicing you got to like forget them because you want to not do that you will not want to get three in a row right so Wow what is three in a row now what is sorry what is Miz there tic-tac-toe win lose or tie who knows I dont know normal taquito is that normal tic-tac-toe is a time so what is misère turns out its also a tie but how do you maintain that tie theres a matter where you go at the beginning by the way the game of tic-tac-toe is so cool because it doesnt actually matter where you go at the beginning you can keep that tie going any one of the squares kind of cool okay how about misère tic-tac-toe well lets think you never want to go where what Square has the most things through it two three in a row that you want to avoid the middle right so you never go the middle so its got to be one of the edges of the corner well how about the quarter how many three two rows on this is the corner three right this way this way and this way how about the edge though just two right so the edges are the better thing to go through so having the edges and then maybe if you forced into the corner lets try it shall we cyber system here we go lets play together this is my system that has strongly solved it and were gonna see if we can win come on class you guys give me a thing sugar corner or edge edge lets count them one two nine one two three four five six seven eight nine ready top room okay edge okay so Im doing so well Im pretty good okay Im gonna stay with the edge lets stay at the edge right okay like this one right its pretty good yeah okay yeah all right how about the other end shes giving the edges to me I love it thats what I want to go anyway Im so happy Im like rock Im giving a little shimmy a little shimmy nananana name Im doing my tic-tac show shimmy and then oh okay well lets see I dont wanna go to the middle okay and I dont want to block him so Ill go over here cuz thats obviously Ill leave this chance for him to get this is the only way for him to win for him to lose was the poison there so Ill go over here and totally rock it ready there and then and maybe that was a good place maybe I well maybe Ill have to go here cuz I cant go in the middle Ill try over here Ill go here thatll be there and then and you start to ask yourself where did I mess up if only so that said together class if only we had a system and or only we had a system that would be able to tell me perfectly what to do here well how about value theres my little stop light and you see that every that move is bad right thats a losing move lets undo to find our green mover I want to find our winning move so lets undo this wheres my green and yeah okay lets undo again theres got to be a green back there right and then lets undo it come on one of those gotta be perfect lets undo again and yeah whoa this is what you call by the way this is the beginning of the first time youve seen a research result you predict a hypothesis that going the middle is bad you then solve it and your computer tells you what the surprising result just like the V that generates is really cool fractal thing that you were surprised I was surprised almost the point of calling home when I found this result I thought this is the coolest result Ive ever seen in which my Hall intuition was totally broken in which the old one square I thought was the worst place ends up being the only place that you can keep your tie and lets see if we can figure out how to do it ready lets click there and notice theres only one place to keep my tie the chance that I choose that its very low right its one in seven theres only one place to move to keep my tie theres only one place to move to keep my tie and its always where exactly the opposite of where the opponent went why is that because theres two cases of three in a row theres a three in a row through the middle and through your oh not through the middle right agree well theyll never be a three road through the middle because if I do that strategy of me in the middle my opponent and me that every path of the middle would be like opponent me me and theyll ever be me the middle three in a row okay you agree with that opponent me me and theyll never be won on the edge why cuz Im always the opposite of my opponent so for me to get three in a row on the edge would have met my opponent just got three in row before me on the edge because I was copying them in a little mirrored way so Ill never lose by doing that and thats the only way to do it isnt that fascinating and wonderful theres like beauty is beauty in that search tree in that tree theres beauty which is that kind of always the opposite is the only way to keep that balance of a tie its really very cool thats awesome I love that okay so so you say well thats cool damn but how do I whats this silly color thing in my hand youre gonna say well and those are you online make sure to download the PDF of this thing okay so on the outer rim is the value of the game itself which is a tie and then I show you the value of the move to that position remember the picture of Tic Tacs how I showed you with the yellow in the middle and red around that I have nine boxes here the nine big boxes on bezier tic-tac-toe show you the basic first move and then you say what if you were what if my opponent were to go in the top right lets just think that if my opponent goes in the top right my opponents making a losing move by the definition going back to like slide four of game theory if my opponent makes a losing move I have a winning position I should be able to win and winning position and what is is one in which there exist so when he moved actually win what is that when he move I dont know lets zoom in on that box and see where the green is so that zoomed in picture is what would have happened what I would have seen in my screen if my opponent had moved in the top right I would have seen those eight boxes why are there eight because I cant go on top of my opponents piece theres only eight free spots thats why there are eight squares there and youll see from that picture that the only way to win if my opponent goes in the top right is to go in on the edges all foragers are equally valid for a win isnt that cool so that is the secret you now have the tic-tac-toe and brassiere ticked I tell answer key in your hands which means you can make the first couple of moves perfectly and its up to you to kind of finish the game off but itll East gets you down the right path isnt that great it might give to you guys so you follow it up and theres a cool picture and its a recursive beautiful fractal picture and its beautiful so to revisit I have a game theory group its called games crafters and I encourage any of you who think this is cool stuff to come join me I have projects of all kinds that can even be relevant and fun and engaging for a cs10 graduate so if you like this stuff come on talk to me next semester and lets populate games crafters with more stuff our group has solved Kinect for like what my group has solved kind of its been done before but never been done and put online you now have can go to a website the website thats on the top of this slide and you go to that site with your smartphone and you will never again lose and connect for did he say never again yes never again if you go first and follow my advice of my program never again lose and connect for in conclusion game theory the borscht the game trees are exponential them the word exponential means it grows faster than linear cubic and quadratic however so is computer processing power increasing with parallelism and all that so what that means is every couple of years we gain another move that we can look into the game tree okay will never that said will never solve some games like go is a go search base is 3 to the 361 how many is that that many positions lets just keep looking that many positions folks never in anyones lifetime in the history of the universe will you solve all the positions of go that said you might have a nice smart AI that will play it pretty well but youll never strongly solve go ok so weak solving means you prove it strong solving is what I do which is you go everything ok
