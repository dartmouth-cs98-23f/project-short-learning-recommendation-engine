wondering whether you can use it to create project management artifacts such as a project plan well if thats the case then youve come to the right place because today Im going to be showing you exactly what this tool can do and whether or not it is something that you could potentially use so Ive got on the screen here Ive put in one of um one of the first kind of prompts just to show you what chat GPT is if you are yet to use it maybe youve heard about it Im not quite sure or maybe its new to you all together so this is what chat GPT is telling me from a prompt where Im asking it is essentially what it is so if we look here it is essentially a larger language model developed by open AI which by the way is kind of owned by Microsoft basically what it does is you input different prompts and what it does is it gives you different responses based on a data set that I believe goes back to 2021 one thats almost looking at a load of data across the internet or that was published before that time its still in a development phase so do bear that in mind and its also has a lot of interest at the moment so sometimes you cant access the tool maybe you have an account already if you do like myself here I can log in and start using it if you dont you may be brought to a page that says its kind of being used and it is a kind of maximum capacity and you might not be able to use it at the time that you want to so just bear that in mind there is a pro feature as well which um will help you to access it in times of a lot of usage but yeah just thought Id give you that kind of context what Im going to show you now is how you can actually use chat GPT to create a project plan so one of the things Id just like to quickly note is that chat GPT is most effective when you kind of get your prompt the kind of more information you provide in your prompt so Ive already thought of this ahead of time of course you may want to adapt this it will depend on the project youre running and you also might want to play around with it um but this is one as an example Im going to be doing it for a marketing project to show you what this tool can do and how quickly it can do it so what Ive put here is create a project plan in tabular form for a marketing project and if we hit this button here its going to create it for us so here we go its kind of going live sure heres an example of a project plan for a marketing project in tabular form and as you can see here it is starting to build it out so youve weve got the task description a start date and end date and a duration and what its doing here is its actually giving us sample tasks as well so obviously this is very very quick its very easy its a very very basic project plan dont get me wrong um but it is one nonetheless and it gives you some ideas for tasks as well so consider this as a first draft and thats one of the benefits of chat gbt is that youll notice this when it finishes um you can ask the the tool to expand upon what its already done um so well wait for it to finish and Ill see what I mean so at the bottom here it says note this project plan is just an example and will vary depending on the scope of the marketing project the timeline and task can be adjusted accordingly so what we can do at this point is we could ask you know could put in a couple more prompts such as provide more tasks we could we could add other prompts such as provide more Milestones or alternatively we could add something like provide more columns for data capture as an example and lets see what happens as I say I dont know what this is going to provide me its a new tool its developing all the time um but as you can see here its given us much you know much a much more expanded product plan that you may need so and again its going to add the task so this is the kind of thing you want to do with it you want to give it a response give it a prompt and then if you need to you can always add to it by adding extra prompts and thats whats great it kind of uses the former response and builds upon it so the next thing that we could do is we could then say something like provide provide this project plan with milestones and subtasks as an example so what I would suggest that you do is head over to chat GPT and and stop playing around with the tool what you can do Ill just wait for it to finish I could press the stop generating button but Im not going to lets just let you know finish this lets finish so that I can we can have a kind of completed version based on um the the problem that weve given it so hopefully this will be done I dont know how long its going to go this is very uh comprehensive this one but yeah as I say this this is a template so you can you can adapt this um or you can use it for ideas this is not going to be a finished thing um or a finished project plan and its not gonna maybe apply to every type of project um you know you might want to type in something like um create a project plan in tabular form for a I dont know uh a technology project or a finance project or you could um you could even say create a project plan with the columns and then put them in quotation marks and it will build it for you obviously in that use case its probably not going to be quicker than just going into Excel as an example but what I wanted to show you here um look weve got some context as well if you wanted to look into it but what you can also do and this is where the speed comes in um is you can select it or Ive got shift on my keyboard held down and Ive selected the whole table a control C and if you go into Excel and Ctrl V youll see its literally brought it in with some formatting as well youve got the gray kind of tabular um for um formatting and then obviously you can just change this by default its that so go fun we can change this to collaborate as an example make it a bit bigger you know you can you can change with the formatting but you know you have got a um a product a basic project plan that you can build from here you can get rid of all the tasks and you could just have the columns but yeah you could save this up and work for me from here but I just wanted to show you this because it is useful chat gbt is developing I believe theyre going to release a new tool at the moment its a students kind of playground phase so yeah its just a lot of testing at the moment um and its not kind of fully available to the public but it will get better and in time who knows this could be much more comprehensive from the outset so I hope this video was useful if it was please hit the like button that tells me I should continue making videos like this and do consider subscribing to the channel if you get over to my channel youll notice theres very different playlists um all about project management whether its project management methodology processes or building out templates like product plans or risk registers as an example and theres also some other playlists on different tools as well that project managers commonly use that you may want to learn more about so with all that said I hope you have an excellent day
