nothing for today chapter 15 evaluation inspection analytics and models so aims so describe the key concept i shaded with the inspection methods explain how to do heuristic evaluation and walkthroughs explain the role of analytics in evaluation describe house to you how to use speed loss a predictive model like so sometimes it is not practical to involve user in any evaluation because they are not available or there is insufficient time or it is difficult to find people so in such circumstances other people often refer to us a expert or researcher can provide feedback these people are [Music] who are knowledgeable about both interaction design and the needs and typical behavior of user various inspection methods for develop alternatives to usability testing in the early 1990s drawing on the software engineering practice where code and other type of inspection are commonly used the evaluation method described so far in our previous lesson have involved interaction with or direct observation of user so in this uh lesson we introduce methods that are based on understanding a user through knowledge codified in heuristic or data collected remotely or models that predict user performance so none of this method required user to be present during the evaluation inspection methods typically involve an expert role playing the user perform the products design analyzing aspect of an interface and identifying any potential usability problem by using a set of guidelines so the most well known are the heuristic evaluation and the walkthroughs analytics involved user interaction lagging which usually done remotely so predictive models involve analyzing the various physical and mental operations that are needed to perform a particular task at the interface and operation analyzing them as a quantitative measure so one of the most commonly used productivity model is the beats law so heuristic evaluation heuristic evaluation is a usability inspection method that was developed by nielsen and his colleague and later modified by other researchers or evaluating specific types of system so in heuristic evaluation expert guided by a set of usability principle known as a heuristic so evaluate whether user interface elements such as dialog box menus navigation structure online health and so on uh on point the tried and tested principle so this heuristic closely resemble high level design principle sample making design consistent reducing memory load and using terms that user understand so the original setup heuristic for atl evaluation was developed by jacob nyonsen and his colleague who derived the apparently from the analysis of a 249 usability problem so the vice version of nielsen regional heuristic first we have the visibility of system status so visibility of system status the system should always keep user informed about what is going on through appropriate feedback with reasonable time next we have um match between system and the real world so meaning um the system should speak the user language with words phrases and concept familiar to the user rather than system oriented terms by the read word a convention making information appear in a natural and a logical order then we have user control and freedom user control and freedom users often choose system function by mistake and will need a clearly marked emergency exit to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialog box example support of undo and next we have the consistence consistency and standard so users should not have to wonder whether different words situation or action mean the same thing uh meaning follow the platform convention then we have the error prevention uh error prevention so even better than good error message is a careful design that prevent a problem from occurring in the first place so either eliminate error prone condition or or check more than a present user with a confirmation option before they commit to the action then we have the recognition then recall it means minimize the user memory load by making objects action and option visible the user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another instruction or use of system should be visible or easily retrievable whether whenever appropriate then we have the flexibility and efficiency of use accelerators so unseen by the novice user may often speed up the interaction for the expert users such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced user so meaning it allows users to tailor frequent action then we have the aesthetic and minimalist design um it means dialog box should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed so every extra unit of information in a dial.com competes with the relevant units of information and diminish their relative visibility next we have help user recognize diagnose recover from errors message should be or error message should be expressed in a plain language so meaning no codes so precisely indicate the problem and constructively suggest a solution help [Music] help and documentation so have an augmentation so even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation it may be necessary to provide help and augmentation any such information should be easy to search focus on the user tasks these concrete steps to be carried out and not to be too large before bleeding on okay so [Music] next dial so number of evaluators and wrap them so this heuristic uh are intended to be used by judging aspect of the interface against them for example uh if a new social networking system is being evaluated they the evaluator may consider how a user would find find out how to add brands to her network or to his network so the evaluator is meant to go through the interface several times inspecting the barges interaction elements and comparing them with the lease of usability principle for example heuristic razor and each iteration usability problem will be identified other diagnosis will be refined until she or he is satisfied that the majority of the of the of them are clear although many heuristics apply to the most product example to be consistent and provide meaningful feedback some of the core heuristics are too general for evaluating products that have come come onto the market since nielsen and mollich first develop the method such as smartphones and other mobile device digital toys online communities ambient device and new web services we also suggest developing categories specific heuristics that apply the specific class of prada as a supplement to the general heuristic evaluator and researcher have therefore typically developed their own heuristic by tailoring a nelson heuristic with other design guidelines market research and requirements document exactly with a heuristic are appropriate and how many are needed for different product is the debatable and depends on the goals of the evaluation but most sets of heuristics have been have between 5 and 10 items so this number provides a good range of usability criteria by which to judge the various aspect of the interface more than 10 becomes difficult for evaluators to remember fewer fewer than pythons not to be sufficient and discriminating a key question that is frequently asked is how many evaluators are needed to carry out two heuristic evaluation while one evaluator can identify a large number of problems he or she may not catch all of them okay sure she may also have a tendency to concentrate more on one aspect of aspect at the expense of missing other for example uh in the study of heuristic valuation where 19 evaluators were asked to find 16 usability problems in a voice response system allowing the customer access to their backup nelson found a substantial difference between the number and type of usability problem found by the different evaluator he also notes that while some usability problems are very easy to find by all evaluators there are some problems that are found by very few experts therefore he urged that its important to involve multiple evaluator in any heuristic evaluation and recommends between 3 and 5 evaluators his findings suggest that they can typically identify identify around 75 percent of total disability problem as shown in our figure thats said nothing okay so however employing multiple experts can be costly skillful expert can capture many of the usability problem by themselves and some consultancies now use this technique as the basis for critiquing interactive products a process that has become known as an expert treaty or expert treat in some countries but using only one or two experts on the heuristic evaluation can be a problematic since research has challenged news and findings and question whether even three to pipe evaluator is adequate for example carton and woodridge point out that the number of experts needed to find 70 percent of problem depends on the nature of the problems their analysis of the problem frequency and severity suggest that the highly misleading findings can so result conclusion from this is that more is better but more is also more expensive okay so however um because user and special facilities are not needed for heuristic evaluation and it is a comparatively inexpensive and quick it is popular with developer and is often known as a discount evaluation so for a quick evaluation of an early design one or two experts can probably identify most potential disability problem but if a total evaluation of a fully working prototype is needed then having a team or expert conducting table ratio and comparing your findings would be advisable heuristic for websites focus on criteria in the recent year so considerable attention has been purposed on the web mobile apps and other digital technologies okay so here is orbital rating website have become increasingly important and several slightly different setup heuristics have been developed a different sets of uh mobile weighting website have been developed based on news and original and heuristic one of this was developed by adibad okay so after discovering that muslim heuristic did not address a problem of a continuously evolving web he also found that there was an overlap between several of the guidelines and that they varied widely in terms of their scope and specificity which made them difficult to use okay so extra from the use of development that emphasize the web design issue first we have the clarity okay so clarity make the system as clear concise and meaningful as possible for the intended audience write a clear concise copy only use technical language for a technical audience right clear and meaningful meaningful labels use meaningful icons next we have um minimize unnecessary complexity and cognitive goal so meaning make the system as simple as possible for the user to accomplish their tasks so remove unnecessary functionality process step and visual clutter use progressive disclosure to hide advanced feature break down complicated processes into a multiple step prioritize using size shape color alignment and proximity then we have provide the user with the context okay so interface should provide user with a sense of context in time and space provide a clear site name and purpose highlight the current section in the navigation provide a breadcrumb trade use appropriate feedback message show numbers of step in a process reduce the perception of the latency by providing visual cues example in progress indicator or by allowing user to complete other tasks while reading next we have promote positive and pleasurable user experience okay so the user should be treated with respect and the design should be aesthetically pleasing and promote a pleasurable and rewarding experience so create a pleasurable and attractive design provide easily attainable goals and provide rewards for the usage and progression so using heuristic bandwidth ambient display again so heuristic evaluation has also been used to evaluate abstract aesthetic peripheral display the portrait none critical information at the periphery of the user attention so since this device are not designed for past performance the researcher had to develop a set of heuristics that took this into account so they did this by developing two ambient display one indicated how to close a bus in the bus stop by showing its number move upward on the screen the other indicated how light or dark it was outside by lightening or darkening the light display so in our figure there are modified uh nielsen heuristic to address the characteristic of ambient display and as a group of experts to evaluate the display using them okay so the heuristic that they develop includes some that were specifically geared towards ambient systems such as visibility of state so the state of this space should be clear when its placed in an intended setting peripherality of this place or the display should be an obtrusive and remains so unless it requires the user attention users should be able to easily monitor the display so in this study the researcher found out that a three-to-five evaluator were able to identify this 40 to 60 percent of known usability issue in the valley of study different researchers used the same heuristic with different ambient application they found a 75 percent of known usability problems with the 8 evaluators and 35 to 55 were found with three to five evaluators suggesting that the more evaluator you have the more accurate the result will be as other researchers uh have also reported heuristic for other products adopted from instant original heuristic have continued to be developed and include heuristic for evaluating shared group wear video games multiplayer games and online communities and information visualization and [Music] eight golden rules of a set guideline first developed in the mid-1980s are also frequently adapted for use with the different types of system and environment and use as a heuristic or identifying usability problem so the first having a adidas eight night and golden rules uh strive for consistency so consistent sequence of action should be required in similar situation identical to terminology should be used in from minimums and help screen and consistent coder laid out capitalization points and so on should be employed exceptions such as record confirmation or delete commands or no echoing password should be comprehensible and limited in number next are catered to universal use usability meaning recognize the means of diverse users and design for plasticity and facilitating transformation of content so now buys to expert a different age range disabilities and technological diversity each energy and spectrums of requirements that guides design adding picture to numbers such as explanation and pictures for experts as shortcuts and password pacing can enrich the interface design and improve the purchases of system quality next offer informative feedback so for every user action there should be a system feedback for frequent and monitor action the response can be or less whereas for infrequent and major action the response should be more substantial visual presentation of object of interest provided a convenient environment for showing changes explicitly next we have the dialog a design dialog to yield a closure sequence of action should be organized into groups with the beginning middle and end informative feedback at the completion of group of action gives a operation the satisfaction of accomplishing a sense of relief a signal to drop contingency plans from the minds and an indicator to prepare for the next group of action for example ecommerce website will be user from selecting product will check out ending with a clear confirmation page to complete the transaction next we have prevent errors as much as possible we sign the systems uh such that user cannot make serious error for example gray out menu items that are not appropriate and do not allow alphabetic characters in numeric entry builds if a user makes an error the interface should detect the error and uh and offer simple constructive and specific instruction for recovery for example a user should not have to retype an entire name address from if they enter invalid zip code but rather should be guided to repair only the uh the quality part error action should leave the system state unchanged or the interface should give instruction about the restoring mistake next we have permit easy reversal of action as much as possible action should be reversible so this feature relieves anxiety since the user knows the errors can be unbanned and encourage exploration of unfamiliar option the units of reversibility may be a single action or data entry task or complete group of actions as entry of name address block next we have the support internal so experienced user uh strongly desired the sense that they are in charge of the interface and that the interface responds to their action they dont want a surprises or changes in familiar behavior and they are annoyed by reduced data entry sequence difficulty obtaining sr information and inability to produce their desired result last we have the reduce the short-term memory loads humans limit capacity for information processing in short-term memory is um that we can remember so so it requires a designer to avoid interfacing which user must remember information from one screen and then use the information on the other other screen it means that the smartphone should not require the entry of the phone numbers website location should remain visible multiple page display should be consolidated and sufficient training time should be allotted for complex sequence of action so three stages for doing heuristic evaluation doing heuristic evaluation can be broken down into into three main stages okay first is um the briefing session to tell experts what to do okay so a prepared script is useful as a guide and to ensure each person receive the same repeat then the evaluation period in which each expert typically spend one to two hours independently inspecting the product using a heuristic or guidance the expert needs to take at least two passes through the interface the first pass gives appeal for the flow of the interaction and the products fall the second pass allows the evaluator to propose a specific interface element in the context of the whole product and to identify potentially usability problem if the evaluation is for functioning product the evaluator need to save some specific user tasks in mind so that exploration is focused suggesting tasks may be helpful but many experts suggest their own tasks however this approach is less easy if the evaluation is done early in a design vendors are only screened map up or specification the approach needs to be adapted to the evaluation in circle circumstances while working through the interface specification or maps a second person may record the problem identified or the evaluator may think aloud alternatively she may take a note herself evaluator should be encouraged to be specific as possible and to record each problem clearly and thats the briefing session we session in which expert together to prioritize problem [Music] okay so [Music] they found i suggest a solution so the heuristic function of the evaluators attention on a particular issue so selecting appropriate heuristic is critically important so even though there are there is sometimes less agreement among evaluator that is is desirable as discussed in our next example okay there are fewer practical and ethical issues near evaluation uh than for other method because users are not involved a week is often cited as the time needed to train evaluator but this depends on the persons initial expertise so typical user can be taught to do heuristic evaluation although there have been range that this approach is not very successful a variation of this method is to take a team approach that may also involve user so advantages and right there okay so you might have been uh have the impression that heuristic evaluation is uh once a poor designer and it can reveal all the wrong with the design however it has a problems shortly after using evaluation was developed several independent studies compare urising evaluation with other methods particularly user testing they found that the different approaches often identify different problems and that sometimes heuristic evaluation is a severe problem so this urge for the using complementary methods furthermore heuristic evaluation should not be taught as a replacement for user testing another problem concerned expert reporting problems that dont exist in other words some of the expert predictions are wrong baillys cite analysis from three published resources sources showing that only around 30 percent of the problem reported were real usability problem some of which were serious others trivial however the heuristic evaluator missed about 20 percent of user problems furthermore about 43 percent of the problems identified by the expert were not problems at all okay so they were pauls alarm so bayless points out point out that this means only about half of the problem identifies our true problem more specifically for every true usability problem identified there will be a little over pulse alarm one is two and about one half of the miss problem so in this analysis is true heuristic evaluators tend to identify more false alarms and miss more progress than they have through hits so the question is how can the number of wholesalers or mysterious problems be reduced so checking the expert really have uh the expertise that they have claimed would have but how can this be done so one way to overcome this problem is to have several evaluators so this helps to reduce the impact of one person experience or poor performance using heuristic evaluation along with user testing and other method is also a good idea one heuristic evaluation has proven to be very useful and used by many usability experts over the years the guidelines were designed to be applied to pc based application there were being developed in 1980s giving the range of current technologies examples smartphones and barges other mobile device tablet ambient system they have been developed since nielsen device his original sets up heuristic so it raises the question whether they can continue to be used to test usability and user experience with a new product for example how useful will they be for evaluating wearable technologies such as smart watches and augmented glasses so what are the heuristic might be needed theres also overlap between how evaluation heuristic and other kinds of design guidance are used design guidelines and often converted into heuristics so it is possible to use this instead or in combination with heuristic evaluation cognitive work tools okay so walkthroughs have been used by system developers for many years or inspecting code and other concept offers an alternative approach to reduce the heuristic evaluation or predicting user problems without user testing as the name suggests walkthroughs involves walking through a task with a product and nothing problematic usability feature most walkthrough methods do not involve users others such as pluralistic walkthroughs involves a team that may include user as well as the developer and disability specialist so ive got the doctors involved simulating the user problem uh solving process of each step in a human computer dialogue checking to see if the user goals and memory for action can be assumed to be the next correction action so the defining feature is that they focus on evaluating design or ease of learning a focus that is motivated by observing observation that users learn by exploration okay so the step involved in cognitive walkthroughs are we have the characteristic of typical user are identified and documented and sampled as are developed the focus on aspect of the design to be evaluated a description map up or prototype of the interface to be developed is also produced along with a clear sequence of action needed for the user to complete the task a designer and one of more expert evaluator come together to do the analysis the evaluator walk through the action sequence for each task placing it with the context of a typical scenario and as they do this they try to answer the following question okay first is will the correct action be sufficient evident to the user so or will the user know what to do to achieve the task so will the user notice that the correct action is available so meaning can user see the button or menu item that they should be used for the next action it is apparent when its needed next will the user associate and interpret the response from the action correctly so meaning will the user know from the feedback that they have made or correct or incorrect choice of action in other words uh will the user know what to do see how to do it and understand from feedback whether the action was correct or not um as the walkthrough is being done a record of critical information is compiling which assumption about the uh would cause problem and why are identified so note about side issues and design changes are made a summary of a result is a compile okay next the design is the revise of the peaks of the problem presented so plus are other type of work tools in which user developers and usability experts work together to step through a task or scenario discussing usability issue associated with the diagonal elements involved in the scenario step in a pluralistic each of the evaluator is asked to assume the role of a typical user scenarios of use consisting of your prototype screen are given to each evaluator who writes down the sequence of action they should take to move from one string to another without uh comparing with bellow panelists when the panelists discuss the action they each asset just before moving to the next round of screen so this process continues until all the scenarios have been evaluated okay so the benefits of pluralistic work tools includes a strong focus on user tasks at a detailed level example looking at the step taken okay so this level of analysis analysis can be uh a valuable for certain kinds of systems such as safety critical ones whereas usability problem identified for a single step could be critical to its safety and efficiency the approach length incept will uh parasitic participatory design practices by involving multi-disciplinary team in which users play a key role furthermore the group brings a variety of expertise and opinions or interpreting each stage of interaction limitation includes having to get all the experts together at once and then proceed at the rate of the slowest furthermore only a limited number of scenarios and transports through the interface can usually be explored because of the time constraint evaluation using analytics so analytics is a method for evaluating user traffic through a system so mostly such system involved selling products or service uh so knowing what customers do and what is important for improving the product or service but analytics are also being used for evaluating non-transactional system when used to examine a topic on a website or part of the website as i mentioned in lesson in chapter seven the analytics are known as web analytics web analytics can be collected locally or remotely across the internet by lagging user activity counting and analyzing the data in order to understand what part of the website are being used and when all the analytics are from our form of evaluation that is particularly useful for evaluating the visibility of a website they are also valuable for business planning including the business of online education recently analytics have been applied to understand how learners in massive open online courses and other web buys web-based education courses interact with this system for example the developers of this system are interested in that as such question as why do learners enroll in this system and what point do learners tend to drop out and why what are the characteristics of learners who complete the course compared with those who do not complete it so now so many companies are developing their own analytics tools other use of the service of companies such as google and vice so which uh specialize in providing analytics and the analysis necessary to understand large volume of data typically these companies present their analysis in forms that are easy to devel for developers and website a manager to understand for example in graphs tables and other types of data visualization the homepage of pcstat or pricestat.com so contains a short uh promotional video describing the hints of services that the company offers and why these services are important to businesses an example of how web analytics can be used to analyze and help developers to improve our website performance is provided by that analysis okay so example okay uh mountain wines okay uh its located in saratoga california so it aims to create a memorable experience for guests who visit the barnyard so following on the traditional started by paul mason world famous winemaker mountain wines offers a beautiful venue for a variety of events including weddings corporate meetings dinner parties birthday concert and vacation so mountain vines uses a variety of advertising media to attract customers to its website and in 2010 invest invested about thousand dollar a month in advertising however the website has remained unchanged for several years because the company didnt have a way of evaluating its effectiveness and could not decide whether to increase or decrease the investment in the they then decide to employ a business staff to use their web analytics tools prior to the in this thing this company the only record that mountain once had of the effectiveness of itself advertising came from the front desk employees who were instructed to ask visitor how did you hear about mountain lions so obviously that provided mountain wines with data showing how their website was being used by potential customer example you get a like thats showing your uh nothing figure 15.4 and for 15.5 provides an overview of the number of page view of the website per day so you speak your pinpoint will provide additional details and show the hours by our traffic so clicking on the first icon for the details show where the ip address of the traffic are located so visit us can also provide information about such thing as which visitor are new to the site which are with uh returners and which other pages visitors came from so using this data and data provided by visit staff mountain ones could see visitor totals and traffics average traffic sources traffic visitor activity and more we discovered uh the importance of visibility for the top search words they could pinpoint where guests were going on their website and they could see where their guests were geographically geographically located social analysis so more recently other types of specialist analytics have also been developed such as visual analytics in which thousands and sometimes millions of data points are displayed and manipulated visually such as social network analysis example so light logging is another interesting variation that can be used for evaluation as well as for sharing information with friends family and colleagues so typically live lagging involves recording gps location data and personal interaction data on smartphones in an evaluation context this can raise privacy concern even though users tend to get used to being that they generally want to remain in a control of lagging so this dilemma analyzing uh social networking behavior sub invasion of privacy so some analytic software can be used by it administrator to track a workers behavior on social networking site during working hours and the data collect that can be used to determine who is collaborating with room and to inform developers about how much of their application are being used or concept often referred to as stickiness so while this reason per tracking user appeared to be a bona pipe so this is a threat to personal privacy uh using web analytics again so there are two types of web analytics on-site and off-site analytics so your on-site analytics are used by website owners to measure booster behavior new upside measure a website visibility and potential to acquire an audience on the internet regardless of the who owns the website so in recent years however the difference between upside and on-site analytics has learned but some people still use this term additional sources may also be used to augment the data collected about a website such as an email direct mail campaign details data sales and history data which can be paired with a web traffic data to provide further insight into the user behavior example are they in google analytics even as early as 2012 google analytics was analytics was the most widely used on the site web analytics and statistics service more than 50 percent of the 10 000 most popular website at that time use google analytics and its popularity continues to soar um [Music] shows part of google analytics for compa how home buying website for the previous edition of this book ideabook.com for the week uh starting at the end of the november 2018 until the beginning of december 2018. okay so its 17 of popular analytics nothing in google analytics delay so since 2012 so in addition to google analytics other tools continue to emerge that provide additional layers of information so good access control option enroll in real-time data collection uh most analytics including another type we should trust search marketing social media marketing and brand activity links and content marketing and its particularly useful for leak management and analysis analysis so you are most analytics now then what initially visits www.moss.com also have the through social metrics uh autonomous attracts social media metrics and helps calculate social media marketing okay so youre gonna type send general record website visitor action and uses meta statistic to create this file shipment predictive models okay so similar to inspection methods and analytics predictive models evaluate a system without user being present so rather than involving expert evaluator role-playing user as inspection or tracking their behavior as in analytics predicted models use formulas to derive values measure of user performance predictive modeling provide estimate of the efficiency of different system for various kinds of tasks for example a smartphone designer may choose to use predictive model because it can enable her to determine accurately which is optimal layout of keys on the phone for allowing common operation to be performed so two types of predictive models have been particularly influential in hci and interaction design over uh over the years the pitch though which we will discuss really in the next slide and the goms or goms it up models which are rarely used now as a tool were designed in the early 1980s primarily for comparing pc-based interface for tasks that were highly predictable always a defeats here so the pits law predicts the time it takes to reach a target using pointing device so it was originally used in human factor research to model the relationship between the speed and accuracy when moving towards a target on a display in the interaction design it has been used to describe the time it takes to point at the target based on the size of the object and the distance to the object specifically it is used to model the time it takes to select object on the screen such as alpha geometric or different spatial configuration one of its main benefits that it can help designer decide whether to locate physical or digital button what size they should be and how close together they should be on a touch display or physical device to begin with it was most useful for designing physical laptop or pc keyboards layouts and the placement of physical keys on mobile devices such as smartphone watches and remote controls since lenses have been used more for designing the layout of digital input displayport touch screen interfaces especially for considering the effectiveness of the new ways of single digit typing such as using fingers or swiping so the bigger the target the easier and quicker it is to reach this is why interface have a big buttons are easier to use than interface that presents lots of tiny buttons clamps together its though also pretty but the most quickly access target on any computer display are the four corners of the screen this uh this is because of their uh pinning action example the side of the display constraint the user from over stepping the target however as pointed out by thug on his asphalt.com website corners seems strangely to be avoided at all costs by the designer it still can be useful for evaluating system where the time to physical locate an object is critical to a pass at hand in particular it can help designer to think about where to locate object on the screen in relation to each other these are specially useful for mobile device where there is a limited space for placing icons and buttons on the screen for example in the study carried out by nokia pixel was used to predict expert expert texts uh enter rates for server inputs methods on 12t cell phone key file the study has the designer to make decision about the size of the key their positioning and the sequence of presses to perform common dust trade-offs between the size of a device and accuracy of using it were made with the help of the calculation from this model pits law have also been used to compare eye tracking input with manual input for visual target so to compare different ways of mapping a chinese character to the keyboard of cell phones and and also to investigate the backup the size of physical gap between display and proximity of targets in multiple display environment and it also used to evaluate tilt as an input method or device with built in accelerometers such as touchscreen phones and tablets computer so the us ask.com website also discuss the application of its law to smartphones and other new technologies with limited screen real estate some key point inspection can be used to evaluate requirements markup and functional prototype subsystem user testing heuristic evaluation may reveal different usability of problem design guidelines can be used to develop your listing walkthroughs are focused so are suitable reading small parts of products and analytics involve collecting data user activity of a website so in our lessons or in this lesson i presented inspection evaluation method focusing heuristic evaluation and work which are usually done by your your specialist usually you refer to an expert who roll these user with the design and prototypes in a specification using their substantial knowledge the kinds of problems that users typically encounter and then offer their opinion so here is the evaluation and workforce offer evaluator a structure to guide the evaluation process and analytics um in which user interaction are logged are often performed remotely and without a user being aware that their interaction rv income so very large of volume data are collected anonymized and static statistically analyze using specially developed software services so the analysis provides information about how a system is used example how different version of website or prototype performed or which part of a website are standard news possibly due to the port usability design or lack of appeal data are often presented visually so that it it is easier to see trends and interprets and results lastly petes law is an example of a technique that can be used to predict user performance but determining whether a proposed interface system or a keypad layout will be optimized typically pizzle is used for use to compare different design up layouts for virtual or physical objects such as both on on a device or screen for small sequence of frequent nipple compass so evaluators typically find that they have modified this metal core valuation with the market since speed slow was originally developed that is similar to the other methods discussed in our earlier lesson which frequently also have to be modified okay so thats it for today and thank you
