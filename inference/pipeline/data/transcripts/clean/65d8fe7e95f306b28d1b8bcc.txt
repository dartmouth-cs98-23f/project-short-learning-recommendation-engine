you about today is programming for the internet so well get started okay first slide is looking at what were going to cover here so were going to you know what were going to talk about is oh you know how the internet works and why but its important to know how the internet works and really the basics of the internet how your change to programming because it really shapes the way that we have to program when were using the internet so were looking a little bit at client-side server-side and then some kind of neat things like Ajax and Java and mobile devices and utility computing in the cloud a lot more to Internet programming Im not going to cover everything but Im going to give you big over big basic overview of some of the stuff with a little bit of detail so you can understand kind of how it looks when you get down into the works of it so first we got to understand a little about the internet when youre programming for the internet youre really looking at this thing that stands between the client and the server and what we mean you guys kind understand what client and server is okay client is most the time you you go the Internet through a browser through something and you want information now you dont stand around and listen for somebody to ask you for information from the internet thats not what youre doing as a client but there are those things out there that do that they just sit there and wait for requests and those are called servers client through the internet makes a request to the server and a server responds so what were talking about is concept of a synchronous not synchronous if Im having a discussion with you its synchronous were talking back and forth asynchronous means I send something up there and then I wait ok well whats happening here is youve got this server there thats just listening for requests ok its got something actually called a listener hey is a request coming in I got a request and then it figures out what to do and it responds to that so it responds to the request and it sends something back but you know what when you have this kind of thing going on it creates challenges for the way that you program because if youre writing a computer program and sitting on top of a computer and you call a function this function is going to come back you dont worry about whether its going to come back you know if the computer crashes in the middle of the function well maybe youre gonna have a problem there and you have some error handling to deal with it but in the world of the Internet you can send requests up there to some server and nothing happens the server just ignores you and says Im not going to give anything back so we got ways that we got to deal with that so you have to have some level of fault tolerance and it creates strategies for dealing with these so lets look at some of this so lets first look at the send everything approach and I know some people are going to take exception the fact that I said that Java is a compiled language because you say its an interpreted language well you know what in some cases it is in some cases it isnt but if youre actually having a pre compiled language I still consider it a compiled language but you have these things called interpreted languages JavaScript being probably the biggest example of an interpreted language and theres other ones but you know thats kind of deal with the biggies here so in JavaScript I send the code to the client okay server says give me this page and the page has a lot of cool things that it wants to do and it has it done in code well you can write JavaScript code that sends it right back over to the client and in this case that the client is a web browser its going to look at that JavaScript and its going to say oh I have code I need to execute its written as text I have to interpret it and do what it says and thats good old JavaScript and learning JavaScript has lots of capabilities and if you want to learn about JavaScript yes we teach classes in JavaScript to teach you to do a lot of things but this is the approach where you send everything over to the client the JavaScript goes to the client if I want to look at your JavaScript I can look at your JavaScript okay its thats it thats how it works now I have other things that can be either compiled or precompiled things like flash and Java and Silverlight and other things that have now in the case of many things like flash lets talk about flash a little bit you know much browsers just dont automatically handle flash being sent to them they have something that sits inside the browser that says oh its flash code I know what to do with flash code and it does all the stuff that the flash tells it to do okay its still setting the stuff over to the browser in most cases in case the bras are still receiving the information and having to do something with it thats the good old send everything approach now whats the downside of this well first thing is youre sending everything over to the browser I mean browser doesnt necessarily need everything so this can really slow stuff down okay you really want to send to the browser because its coming through an internet connection uh you wanna send just what the browser needs okay well what about some sort of interaction well suppose I have I something I want to do on my browser that requires a tremendous amount of data to be looked at and compiled okay well am I just going to send all the data to the browser and then work from it from there am I going to actually try to send it just the data that I need so what about the data if you try to do with you know especially when you have to wrangle down and do it lots of data you know you want to get that data and it that you need and you really want to have the server deal with a lot of that details of figuring out this needs to go to you this needs to go to the browser so what will we do about this well lets get a way to to communicate back and forth with the server so anytime you request a pet a webpage you send a request up to the server and the server comes back and says hey I got that file Ill send it to you and it sends it to you and there it goes but now you want to ask for more detailed information youre actually an ask for not just a page a file thats sitting on the server but the servers got to do something a little bit more complex to put everything together before it sends it to you and its got ways to do this Im going to go with the two Biggies HTTP GET HTTP POST and youve used both of them if youve ever used the internet youve used them both and really the difference between the two is wheres the information that youre sending to the server not the information coming back from the server but the request that youre sending this server where is that information that really specifies what you want an HTTP GET you use the URL of the request an HTTP POST you use the body of the request the big difference being if you know what to look for you can read all the information youre asking for in the HTTP GET in an HTTP POST its hidden from you so lets look at an HTTP GET this is an actual web URL I can send you this web URL and if you bring this web URL upon your browser youre going to get exactly the same thing that I get if I do it here okay its not that theres some file thats got this big massively long name with all this gobbledygook in it what youre actually doing is youre saying Im going to send some information to do google.com slash search ok now if you look at this theres a question mark right there that question mark delineates everything on this side is where Im sending it and everything on this side is what Im sending it so that the server can look at all this stuff and it can say oh I know what to do with this and really whats happening here is its saying you know what site equals IMG HP ok the server is going to go I got a key value pair Ive got a key site and Ive got some sort of value thats IMG HP so when Im looking for what I want to send back Im going to look for that key site and the value and Im going to figure out what to do with it so you have a where and you have a lot that youre sending over and the what can get really long cant be infinitely long okay because get requests have some things about them that are important like length restrictions okay other thing is if youre sending sensitive data okay to a server probably not a good idea to pop it into the get pop it into a get request and do it that way because guess what anybody can see the URL so sitting up there at the top of the browser up in the URL bar okay but theres some nice things about it like you know it sits in the browser history you can cache it it gets bookmarked you can bookmark get requests I can take that big old loan request I have write that back there that I just shows you I can bookmark it and I can bring it up whenever I want to okay so pretty much the guidelines the other set of guidelines for using get and casada guidelines for using post and we like to follow those but lets talk a little bit about post so he cant see the dad in post what you see in the URL bar just looks like the webpage but its still asking for stuff what happens is the data from the post is sitting inside of the actual document that youre sending over so theres actually more than your setting than just a URL theres actually more stuff in that packet that you send to the server than just whats in that URL bar okay but that gives you some limitations that go with it too like you cant you cant bookmark a post because theres nothing in that URL when you save a bookmark youre just saving the URL okay well the information that you want to send to the server is it in the URL so therefore guess what youre not going to be able to bookmark it if you do that and yes and you send you know you click on the bookmark its just going to go there and go I dont have the information you actually need okay but it says one nice thing about it no restrictions on the data length and actually not a lot of restrictions on that type either so you know youve got some pretty neat things that you can do there okay you know its security I can take the post data and I can actually encrypt it and send it over to the server now of course that doesnt mean that the server is going to have to be able to decrypt that so not you know cant be if you cant decrypt it and dont send an encrypted but if you need security just but that encryption algorithm on both sides and youre good to go so lets look at this what actually is happening now weve got we got some background here what happens when you go through this client thats you write web browser whatever doesnt matter whether youre on a mobile phone whether you know its the same thing you request to pay age okay server sees that request and says you know what I got to come up with the response I send the response back to the client client receives a response okay client now says you know what I looked at this this is a person or it can actually be a piece of suffer on the client that does that says ah thank you I am going to give you a new request it sends a request over to the server and then it goes through the server and the server receives in response okay if you notice whats going on here okay the big difference between the client and the server servers up here listening notice the communication really goes to that server client doesnt do anything unless the servers received a request from that client okay so isnt pushing stuff to your browser okay an action can push stuff your through your browser if youre on a specific page that allows for you to do that but thats code thats sitting there that makes that that makes that possible okay youre not just going to open up your browser and all sudden all the servers go oh look hes got his browser up lets start throwing stuff atom in how it works okay your client isnt listening for that type of thing unless you actually send a request out so lets talk about the Refresh Yuval use browsers you do something you click and the page refreshes okay now what about that refresh every time you refresh a page you send everything again its all going you can put requests up there and the whole page refreshes you know a lot of the times you dont need to refresh the whole page you may need to refresh a little piece of that page okay that brings out a whole new paradigm and actually dealing with web programming okay suppose you send a request up and you only need to refresh a small part of the page lets just do that lets not refresh the whole page lets just refresh the little piece that you need okay well how do you do that well you got a technology for you to do that called Ajax we have a nice pretty name for it called asynchronous JavaScript and XML okay well why because the background technologies that make it possible are JavaScript and XML okay so it only refreshes a little piece now lets take a little look at why this might be important to you because if youre a web programmer you dont want to be clogging up the bandwidth here you want to only send information through the pipes that you need to send through the pipes so lets take an example of this okay this is a cascading drop-down this is one of the Ajax examples from the Microsoft web page and a cascading drop-down lets say you know what you could send all the mix of all the cars to the client and all the models of all the mix of all the cars to the clients and then all the colors of all the models of all the makes to the client so you know what thats a lot of data I dont want to do that what I want to do is I want the user to select to make okay and based on the make that he selected I want the server send back and put into a drop-down just the models that go with that specific make well Ajax lets me do that but what am i doing when I do that this is on a web page Im not refreshing the entire page Im only going to refresh that drop-down thats it thats all I want Im done good finished okay and once you select that model all I want to see is what colors are available for that make and model like C green so thats thats Ajax in a nutshell now of course its not just dropdowns its all sorts of different things you can have a web page but thats the guts and understanding how it works so next language Java not going spend a lot of time with Java because Java is a lot of things to a lot of people but what Java allows you to do is have a full programming capability embedded inside of webpages and all other types of devices its multi-platform it can work on all over the place well doesnt mean that a Java Java program that you write for a browser is going to work on a phone unless it maybe its on the phone browser but what means its one language you can do all those types of things so job is that great thing to try to be everything to everybody well it kind of meets a lot of that but in some places it doesnt do all that it does have one thing thats really nice about it which is the good old just-in-time compilation hey you read about Java youre going to hear about just-in-time compilation which gets me back to that first slide where they say or some people say well no child is an interpreted language no its not it is compiled its just that its just in time compilation okay it does go to a machine level code if you do that you know machine level code is you can send stuff over its not the raw text of the code and you can do stuff with it and it can be very fast that way now lets talk a little bit about mobile devices okay so anybody whos been doing programming has got to deal with all the different kinds of devices that you might be dealing with well when you get down into the guts of it mobile device programming browser programming not really different its got clients its got servers its got listeners okay that part of the programming model doesnt change so if you understand how that works guess what it still works okay however the paradigm turn on the way you use mobile programming is totally different from the way somebody whos stuck behind machine gate behind a keyboard looking at a screen you got thing held in your hand its small it moves around okay got to do that so first if youre thinking hey I have an app programmer well that doesnt mean youre an Internet programmer and that programmer can be very simple I can have an app that I download onto my mind to my phone and its a game and itself itself all together everything is in that app thats not an Internet program it was just downloaded over the Internet that doesnt make it an Internet program internet programs communicate back and forth with other machines over the Internet a lot of apps are internet programs and the big expectation for most apps is that they do have that ability to interact with the Internet so what youre doing is youre taking things that you did do it once in a browser okay like interpreting code and doing stuff with it and youre now doing this on a very small very small device so like my little very small device right here my Galaxy s3 which you know is a pretty awesome phone its got a really big screen but guess what that big screen is still a lot tinier than one of the other devices that I can show you right here which is an iPad this is my iPad wait turn around this way so you can see it okay and Im actually delivering to you this lecture on a computer so Ive got all three of the primary devices sitting right in front of me different to the paradigm well yeah now are delivering to something small and youre delivering it typically not necessarily as a browser thing designed for a small mobile device but yet you cant have specific web pages designed for mobile devices but one likely youre probably programming apps and apps are specific they do specific tasks and thats their actual the nice utility of the concept of the app but the biggie and the paradigm is the fact that its something that moves around you have mobility of user so you have a lot of freedom of what you can do also you have a lot of things that sit on top of this Im going to go right here and Im going to go ahead and pull this baby down here I have okay and you can see this I have Wi-Fi connection its going to be all blurry but yeah I have Wi-Fi I have GPS I have all these Bluetooth I have all these other toys that I can play with that are part of this phone that a totally different operating system in this case Android that Im working with the cloud well I understand the cloud you got to understand the concept of a web service and its actually not that hard ok if youre a typical programmer youve wrote classes and classes may have methods but the basics of programming boils down to you know object-oriented program is a way to organize functions but we have object or ePro grams so we call the methods okay basically a piece of code does something ok and it sits on the machine and its compiled and it works there and the machine calls the functions and you have function libraries and all this well the cloud takes all of that and exposes it to the web thats the basis of the cloud all those things that you can do right now with a machine become exposed to the entire world at large now of course that doesnt mean youre just going to go ahead and expose all your functions youre going to have some level security goes there but now here youve got these clients or servers because servers call the functions on other servers all the time and youve got some sort of interface that makes them which we call the server interface that makes them available to the rest of the world and we call that stuff web services and we put all those web services together and we have the cloud and the cloud allows us to have something new called utility computing I can pay for just the services I want I dont have to buy a whole bunch of stuff that Im not going to use I can have a lot this so heres how this looks to the real world as youre doing this heres you the client kr maybe over here youre the programmer but say to the client and you go to the cloud to get stuff and what you know about what most people know about it is a lot of stuff happens here well thats all that stuff that happens in the cloud its all happening right out there in the cloud and you dont really worry about what it is happening except if youre a cloud programmer and then you do ok but if were going to be a cloud programmer youre going to take a cloud programming classes youre going to learn all about cloud programming and youre going to deal with a lot of stuff so what kind of cloud services do you have here well one of the things can happen is hosting the software d2l which is used at Daytona State College its actually a hosted software the server managed d2l okay theyre not actually on the campus theyre actually I think theyre in Canada so you know thats an external hosting but its a piece of software that we use you can store files that it documents host meetings you can actually beautiful operating system you can manage businesses accounting okay essentially anything that you could do on a computer or anything you can do on a mobile device or anything you do on a tablet can all be cloud services okay can be done the cloud okay you still need some sort of device to get the stuff back on well list right now you do and we dont going directly to peoples brains but who knows whats coming up later but its all right there I mean its all available and actually right now youll see most of stuff is now moving to the cloud and you could hear about migrating new cloud but cloud is a great thing so some of the languages of technology this is just okay I was going to do one slide I can do 10 slides but Im just going to say what are the technologies that you will probably learn if youre dealing with this Im going to learn some databases I just listed a few of them youre going to probably learn some languages these are all languages that are very much tied specifically to things that we do over the net the internet and Internet programming um no I listed PHP dont say what about Python what about Ruby on Rails ah yeah I know theyre there great awesome good okay just listing some of them JavaScript okay theres no one java.net entire platform thats you know really built for how to do so for the net I octave program and c-sharp I got a whole bunch of stuff written in VB okay theres languages that go behind that you can write that stuff in multiple languages okay working with databases you have T sequel PL sequel two examples of that if you want to actually interface with databases thats some of the stuff that you would learn okay theres a lot really there really yes put it all together how this all goes together well we looked at how the internet works and why we care well if youre dealing with this kind of concept of clients and servers and listeners and requests and responses its a totally different architecture really than what you have in programming and the fact that its now can be asynchronous and you may not get a request not that tremendously different though than how regular old programming works we looked at client and server based programming stuff that client pace and everything go to the client let them worry about it server based program lets talk lets go back and forth Ajax lets talk only about the things we want to talk about Java hey were going to solve all the problems of the entire world with one language mobile devices oh gosh now theyre actually walking around with computers in their hands and the cloud hey everything is no longer on a computer this is state right now okay 2013 this is all going to change in five years okay if you want to be a internet developer web programmer that type of thing first thing you got to do is you go like learning because guess what everything that you learn now is going to migrate it to the new stuff okay most of the time its awesome because you get all these new capabilities and new markets and new things that you can do its a very rewarding type of field to work into but it also changes a lot and you got me when those guys that likes programming likes learning likes new paradigms if every time something changes you dont start grumbling okay go into some other field if you do like learning you like programming you like the new stuff this is it you will never get bored about having to learn new stuff in this field thank you very much hope you enjoyed this lecture on the internet and web programming in internet programming and all the stuff good programming see you later
