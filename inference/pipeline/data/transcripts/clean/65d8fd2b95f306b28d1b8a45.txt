Who knows what it means? Loads and loads of lines none of them labeled. I think the thick one is more important. Thats thats what Ive learned from this Data visualization is another method we can use along with Statistics to have a look at our data Explorer our data and try and work out whats going on Its a way of trying to understand our data better so that we can then perform You know more rigorous statistical tests or actually start to draw conclusions or model our data Its a very important tool but youve got to use it properly You cant just plot anything and everything Every chart you use has got to support your hypothesis or its got to try and show the story Youre trying to tell right? You dont just plot something because it could be plotted. Theres got to be a point to it Theres a lot of problems with using inappropriate grass and only picking subsets of your data. Thats a huge problem, right? That is not just a problem for data visualization. Thats a problem for your statistical test as well If youre only using some of your data, its that okay Its going to depend on the situation right my um, you know but I think theres a strong argument for saying youve got to be really really careful and youve got to be really structured and regimented and Document everything you do. The core problem with visualization is that people just plot stuff and they do it badly maybe they use the inappropriate plot type or they Dont scale of axes properly and that leads to huge misunderstandings and actually can be quite misleading, right? This happens a lot in the media So, for example, you might get a sort of political message for your door, but says these are different parties So this is party one This is party to this is party three and maybe you know party ones got this many votes and party twos got This many votes and party three two Right down here and party two are trying to make the case that just a few more votes and theyre gonna win in this area why but actually written down here this is twenty thousand and this is ten thousand and this is you know, Eight thousand and just in the small labeling theyve got here Theyve completely skewed the axis right ten thousand is half of twenty thousand yet. Here. We are up here if you misuse plots Its actually misleading when its on your own data Youre going to draw the wrong conclusions and then spend quite a while researching into an area but doesnt make sense or and ends up in failure or if its if Its something youre presented to someone else. You can mislead that person whether intentionally or by accident And thats never a good thing. Im back in our and I just wanted to show a couple of plots that you know Its not misleading necessarily, but you can easily infer the wrong kind of information, right so Theres this websites online You can go to to look at the ratings for different TV shows right now. One of my favorite TV shows is Fraser, right? I think its amazing and If you go on to these sites and you plot the Ratings for all these Fraser episodes. Its all over the place Sometimes its very highly regarded and sometimes its not so Im just going to plot this using the GG plot tool and we can see if we look at the graph that Its absolutely everywhere. Right? Youve got good episodes. Youve got bad episodes and it seems to maybe be going slightly downhill towards the end But its difficult to say right because its all over the place Now whats actually happened is Ive just plotted using a default function and its Auto scaled my rating axis, right? so my y-axis is the rating of the episodes and its going between seven and About nine and a half now that isnt representative because its spreading out my data if I plot the exact same data But this time from naught to ten like an actual rating system You can see that most episodes get almost the exact same rating somewhere between around seven and a half to eight Which I thinks pretty good I would rate them a 10, but you know Its just me. You can see that even if youre not careful If you do it by accident, even auto-scaling a maxis and things like this can cause a real problem another classic example, youll see In the news is when they show something like a currency exchange rate So if we look at here weve got our Ive downloaded some sample data of the Japanese yen versus the US dollar and Ive simplified this by Extracting just a period of about 60 days in the middle of some time I cant remember exactly what it is If we plot this you can see that actually theres a big sort of cliff edge Something terrible has happened around day 30 and the value of the Japanese yen is just plummeting And of course, this is absolute nonsense, right? Because this scale goes between 108 and a hundred and fourteen And so if we plot it with a proper axes on you can see that actually its almost completely flat If your business relies on the exchange rate of a Japanese yen to the US dollar Obviously these small changes might be important right but if youre presenting this in the news Its very easy to claim that something terribles happened when in fact actually, maybe this is just normal blip up and down, right so You can misuse Plots to serve your purpose right or and you can do it accidentally and waste a huge amount of time Lets have a look at the standard plots You might see right and you could use on a very basic level and see you know What are they appropriate for right because one of the most important things is that you use these plots and these charts Appropriately, alright, so, you know, perhaps the most common one that everyone sees is going to be a bar chart Youve got two axes Youve got some kind of attributes or labels down here and then youve got some quantity or amount of some attribute here And then youre going to have different bars like this now This is a very nice graph to use its simple but its effective because you can very easily see what the difference between these different Levels are right so that you know, its often going to be your go to graph for lots of things Right, some people now some people try and replace this graph of a pie chart, right? This is a bad idea in general I mean I like pie as much as the next person but if youve got different things Like this and one of them is big I mean you can see that this ones bigger than this one, but how much bigger it is? I dont know You cant see the relative sizes quite so easily this all gets worse if you combine this into a doughnut plot And then youve got multiple pies embedded in each other none of them align and nothing makes any sense anymore, right? So if in doubt dont use a pie chart, its a bad idea. I mean they look very nice for presentations Thats about what I can say for it if were going to be measuring some call of quantity then a bar charts going to be What we want right but what we might also do is replace quantity with the with the frequency or the amount of something So this is gonna be frequency. This is also our labels again on the bottom here Weve got our labels and this is going to be bins for some single attribute So this is maybe so naught to 10 that misses maybe 10 to 20 of whatever the thing is And this is a frequency the amount that fall into that range and what this allows us to do is work out very easily What the distribution is is it normally distributed, but Im only distributed with two peaks, you know Is it suitable left skewed to the right? We can see very easily the shape of our data and it can be really helpful Another way of looking at this sort of the shape or the range of our data in particular is a box plot right now Youll see box plots come up from time to time with scientific Documents but theyre very easy to produce in tools like are and they can be quite useful So here were gonna have a single attribute So some label again or some attribute here and this is going to be the quantity of this attribute And what a boxplot does is label the range of that data So were going to have a box here like this and its going to look a little bit like this So Ill use a different color pen This line in the center is our median typically and then this is going to be the third quartile here Third quartile and this is going to be the first quartile and then these are the max and the min in this one plot Weve got the absolute range of our data Weve got where 50% of our data is sort of this interquartile range here and we know where the midpoint of our data is So we can very easily see whether weve got outliers and we can plot this next to a different attribute and we can have two box plots next to each other and we can See very quickly, you know a comparison between these two things so that can be really useful now the final ones right? Were going to be talking about scatter plots and trend lines. All right, so its got to pop very simple. Weve got two Attributes, this is attribute one and this is attribute two, and we want to see how they bury with respect to each other So when one goes up does the other one go up or does it go down are they even related to? So youll see something like this and itd be all over the place often But you can see maybe theres a kind of trend where as attribute one increases attribute two increases right now This is a correlation being shown here. Not a causation. So you cant say theyre definitely related, but you can say that generally speaking when one is big so is the other thats but sometimes useful a Trendline is going to be where were going to be plotting something over time My so this has to be a continuous variable or at least a variable we believe Can be inferred between our points like its unlikely, but youre gonna have all the points So you what you might have is you might have a plot where youve got time Down here. So maybe time in mumps, for example And weve got some amount of something and were just going to plot it like this and we can sort of have a trendline going Like this if its a situation where we can infer the amount between two time points then this is okay Right because we can say well look weve got a reading here. Weve got a reading here Its reasonable to assume that between these two points. This is the amount All right. Nothing to funnys gone on between these two points, right? If you cant assume that then you shouldnt really be using a trendline and you probably want to be using a bar graph Does that depend on the kind of day to them? Yes, itll depend on it This is a judgment call based on the kind of data So if a data I mean time is a good good example. We dont tend to measure sort of in infinitely small increments Were going to be measuring daily or hourly or something like this but we can kind of make an assumption a lot of the time that our readings like temperature for example over time if Youre at 20 and then the next hour youre at 25. Were probably halfway between there to between those two times, right? Its going to depend on your data I mean a good example would be if you were plotting something like operating system usage per student so weve got OS X here, but Linux here and weve got Windows these many people use OS X this many people uses Linux this many people use Windows Well bees have discrete data points. You cant fit a trend line to these. There is no operating system Thats 50% between Linux and Windows that I know of and we cant infer How many students are going to be using it that makes no sense? That should be a bar chart? So lets look at an actual data set and see how we can use some of this visualization in practice So Ive got here a chicken data set and this data set is about Weighing chickens on different diets over a period of weeks and also measuring how many eggs they produced Im not a farmer, but lets imagine that what we wanted to do was see if one of these Diets produces a better weight gain and maybe more eggs per week. Lets have a look So Im going to load the chicken data set. This is at stored in a CSV Just like before lets have a quick look at just the first few rows of this data to see what they look like So thats going to be the head function and we you can see weve got six attributes So weve got the week but the measurement was taken the chicken in this case of chicken number one, but theyll obviously be other chickens diet, theyre on a diet B or diet see the age of the chicken in mumps the weight of a chicken in kilograms and the Number of eggs they produce that week. All right, so theres going to be lots of combinations of weeks and chickens in this data set Now what we want to try and do is see if theres any kind of relationship between the diet Theyre on and the number of eggs. Theyre producing or the weight of a chicken or anything like this So the first thing we could do is we could have a look at the aggregate function So Im going to paste this down here. Well talk through it. What the aggregate function does is let us produce Lets say a summary or calculate some means or medians Over a data set but this time grouping by a certain attribute so in this case What were going to do is were going to aggregate the weight of the chickens bar in groups of their diet So all the As all the Bs and all the Cs and then were gonna for each of those Were going to calculate a summary So lets run that and you can see that weve got our group down here for a weve got the minimum the maximum The median the mean and we can see some slight differences perhaps in these data sets I mean the median mean for example of Group A. Its 3.8. Whereas the mean for Group C is 3.4 So maybe theres a slight difference in these things. Okay. So lets try a different aggregate function So this time were going to aggregate the number of eggs produced groups by again the diet So this is going to be all the As all the Bs and all the Seas and then were going to produce a summary so we can see that the median number of eggs produced for group a is 4 per week and For group B and Group C is 3 per week. So maybe again theres a slight difference Were starting to learn a little bit about our data. So lets start with histogram light So what were gonna do were gonna use this histogram function Which is mostly labels like the hist function in our produces a histogram And were going to produce a histogram of the ages of a chickens. So whats the distribution of the ages? Are they old are they young? And were gonna use 15 breaks That means were going to take the whole range and break it into 15 columns 15 bands right now actually, I will do a little bit of Just a few checks behind the scenes to make sure 15 is an appropriate number and might adjust it up or down slightly so we can see this histogram broadly speaking our Chickens are evenly distributed among the different ages weve got some young ones that sort of 60 or 70 weeks old older ones that are 350 weeks old and then for some reason weve got a peak around 250 I dont know why that is but I maybe weve got a batch of a certain age of chickens in And lets finally lets look at the box plot So we talked about the blocks plot box plot will tell us the minimum the maximum For an attribute and also the median in the range, right? So this is really helpful So were just going to have a look just to age just for all chickens So you can see that the median is around 220 something like that and then the majority of the chickens, so 50% of the chickens fall between about 150 weeks old and 300 weeks old but you can see there are some very young ones and some very old ones this kind of Plot will end. Its really size up where our data sits before we start to make any assumptions so lets imagine now that we want to try and drill down into his day to a bit and work out whether Actually the diet had any effect on the number of eggs or the weight of a chicken, right? so what were going to do is were going to group were going to use the aggregate function again to calculate the means of All the weights per week. I was going to copy that down here So were going to say aggregate the weight of the chickens by both the week and the diet so combinations a week one die a week to die a and so on and I dont want you to calculate the mean for all chickens, so Run that so that produces some statistics on the different average weight of chickens over time Im going to rename the columns so that theyre a little bit more informative that sort of run that line there And then finally, were going to plot this now Were going to use GG plot for this, you know, whether you use the inbuilt our plot functions or enough alive We like GG plot will kind of depend on what plot you want to do in general You can get quite nice plots with GG plot, but theyre a little bit more involved. Alright, so Im going to run this line here Looking at this data we can kind of see that maybe da a is having a positive effect, right? So down at the bottom where no weeks are passed at the beginning of our experiment There were roughly the same weight and then the average weight of a actually does seem to increase So I guess thats something interesting about our data right now Lets look at number of eggs, right so were gonna do the same thing this time Were going to aggregate the number of eggs by week and by diet so they dont copy that and Im going to give it some Helpful labels as well and then were going to put the data. Lets see Over time whether or not any of the diets have any effect on the eggs, and its looking pretty good Alright, so this is the frequency as the number of eggs were producing the weeks is the twelve weeks of our Experiment and you can see that diet B and IC produce roughly the same number of eggs per week This is averaged over all the chickens but diet a produces at least an egg more per week on average You know, thats a 20% increase Roughly speaking. If youre if youre a farmer, thats a great thing But the problem weve got is that this might be a little bit too good to be true What were seeing here is perhaps an issue of correlation versus causation So we can see here that there is a correlation between the diet thats being used and the number of eggs but we dont know but its the diet specifically that causes it were looking more detail at the ages of the chickens specifically because Im Interested to know him whether or not Paul older chickens produce more or fewer eggs Right because that could be relevant to our to our experiment Okay, so were going to group the chickens up by diet and then work out what their average age is so mean age So Im going to calculate this On this here, and then Im going to look at it And we can see that the average age the mean age for Group A or these chickens on diet a is only 156 weeks but the age for lets say Group C is 248 weeks are significantly older. All right, so we need to just check that This isnt going to be an issue for the number of eggs laid So lets plot the number of eggs versus the age of the chickens, right? So here were going to Generate a scatterplot of age versus the number of eggs But were also going to color by diet so we can see roughly where the different diets sits. Lets run this Okay, so what we can see is but actually as chickens get older we do see a quite serious decrease in the number of eggs Produced per week from about four and a half hour wage down to about two and a half or two average, right? And also we can see that IAE is predominately sitting up here, which means that the chickens are younger So this could be a problem What were saying is that it could be that we happen to have put a load of young chickens on diet a and yes Theyre producing more eggs, but that isnt because of die a thats because theyre younger, right? So lets have a look at a box plot of the age of chickens per diet and you can see that theyre significantly younger on diet a so I think the conclusion we can draw is but its theoretically possible that theres a link between the diet and the number of eggs produced But we cant really say it from this data. Were going to need a lot more data. Maybe some you know some more chickens I like to try and work this out. Weve seen a number of different visualizations and the important thing is that we use visualizations Appropriately and we dont make assumptions about our data So were going to start to look at cleaning of data and then maybe using our data in clustering and classification but Visualization is a really good way to start off exploring your data and generate some initial hypotheses Well, were looking at chocolate datasets today, so I thought Id bring some research Yeah, good and definitely relevant
