hello everybody and welcome back Im going to apologize right now for this long introduction but what Im trying to do in this video is teach you software design at a very fundamental level so Ive heard you guys loud and clear a lot of you are sick of the beginner tutorials youre sick of people assuming you know nothing and you want to get more into the intermediate and advanced level you want to figure out how do I design software how do I look at some system some program and come up with some kind of plan some kind of implementation approach or strategy that is exactly what Im gonna be showing you here so on the left hand side of my screen you can see that we have this kind of mock software system that Ive just come up with this completely random example that I just wrote up before this video and what were gonna be doing is looking at this block of text here which you can really think of as the client you can think of is this is what the client wants this is what the person youre writing code for wants how do you take simply these four paragraphs here and translate that into a fully functioning software system that is exactly what were gonna be doing here so were gonna look through this were gonna go through the process of picking up valuable information and then what were gonna do is actually draw up a class diagram that has what our plan is going to be when we start implementing this and that leads me to my next point which is planning when you want to get out of that intermediate or you want to move from kind of intermediate to more advanced you already know how to program the next step is thinking about designing programs designing software its not enough to be good at programming what you need to do is actually be able to think about the kind of overarching architecture of the program that youre writing you want to think of okay how are these objects these classes this system going to interact with other things and how can I think about all of these things before I actually start writing code that is what we are going to be doing here so without further ado lets go ahead and get started Im gonna read through this design problem here there will be a link in the description if you prefer to read through that yourself I would encourage all of you before I go ahead and start doing all of this for you and showing it to you that you think about how you might design something that looks like this and if you were immediate thought as I have no idea then while this video is going to be perfect for you because Im going to show you exactly how we can do this so lets go ahead and read through this so the problem Ive had here is a design problem tech with Tim school of programmers so I just kind of made this name up I thought it would make sense I assume a lot of you guys are students or you were at one point a student so I think this will relate to a lot of you and the idea here is that the tech with Tim school of programmers needs a new system to track all of its students professors and courses so think of this as some kind of like you know mini University or something and they want a system or a database or something like that where they can track all of this information maybe they can ask some type of questions about a student they can check grades they can see whos teaching a course thats what this really is so well go through the details here but it wants to keep track of what courses are offered who teaches each course and which students are enrolled in those courses it what else would like to be able to track the grades of each of its students across all courses for each student and professor the school needs to know their address phone number and H so immediately even in just this first paragraph this has told us a lot we need a system right because were just thinking about what is it that we actually need from the system these are really the requirements that are being listed out here and this system needs to keep track of students it needs to keep track of professors and it needs to keep track of courses what else doesnt need to keep track of well for each person we need their address their phone number their name and their age so lets keep that in mind well read through the rest and then well distill all of this ok so each course has a maximum and minimum number of students that they can enroll if the minimum number of students is not reached then the course will be canceled each course is taught by at least one professor but sometimes may be taught by many so in some situations there may be more than one professor that teaches the course all right professors are salaried employees at the tech with Tim School of programmers and therefore we need to keep track of how much they make each year if a professor teaches more than four courses in a semester they are granted a one-time bonus of $20,000 all right students can both can be both local or international students and full or part-time a student is considered a part-time student if they are enrolled in less than one or two courses during any given semester so actually sorry this should say if they are enrolled in one or two courses during any given semester so essentially you are part-time if you were taking two or less courses in a semester the maximum amount of courses a student may be enrolled in at one time is six students receive grades from each course these grades are numeric in in the range of 0 to 100 any students that have an above-average grade across our have an average grade sorry across all enrolled courses that are lower than 60% is said to be on academic probation so I apologize for butchering butchering some of that speech there but the idea here is we have this system its fairly simple we need to keep track of students professors those students grades across all of the courses theres a few small nuances within that but this should be something that were gonna be able to design and hopefully in the next you know 30 45 minutes with me explaining everything that Im doing so given this block right given this text what we need to do now is translate this into a program and the first thing that I want to do is start thinking about all the information that I actually need to track and all of the potential classes Im going to have in my UML class diagram so were gonna design this using an object-oriented style which is very common and what most people kind of do and this doesnt necessarily mean that what Im gonna design here will be the final implementation that we actually program up this is just kind of the thing that is you know our design this is what we thought this is our plan its totally fine if we decide to deviate from this later especially if other things come up but we should at least have some kind of idea of what we want to do then we can follow about when we actually start coding so what Im gonna do is have two windows here one on the left one on the right and Im going to start listing first of all all of the classes that I think we should actually have based on the information Ive seen here and this is kind of the first step think about all of the objects you might have in a system all of the main components that might have information within them so the first thing Im gonna list here is students right we will probably have a student class because were gonna have multiple students the next thing were probably gonna have is well professors now I dont know if thats how you spell professors but and well put that there so were gonna have a student class and a professor class because were gonna need both a student and a professor and this has different information contained in it than the professor dis awesome alright so student professor next thing we need is probably a course right were gonna have different courses those are gonna be taught by professors and those are gonna be taught by students and after reading this are not taught by students or I students will be enrolled in that course and after reading this first paragraph that is kind of what Ive grabbed from that so Ive said okay we need to keep track of students professors and courses all we need to see what courses are offered who teaches the course whos enrolled keep track of grades okay so that mate brings me to grades so now I need to keep track of greats how am I gonna do that well well keep moving and then well think about how thats gonna happen so each course has a maximum and minimum number of students that can enroll if the minimum number of students has not reached in that course will be canceled each course is taught by at least one professor but sometimes taught by many okay so that doesnt give me any more classes I dont think right now at least and lets keep going professors are salaried employees at Tech with Tim schooled programmer and therefore we need to keep track of how much they make a year okay that doesnt says say anything to me students can be both local or international a student is considered a part-time student if theyre enrolled there one or two courses during any given semester that the duh duh okay and now after reading all of this what Ive determined is we have student we have professor we have course the only thing were really missing here is a way of keeping track of who is enrolled in what course and what grades each of these students have so what Im actually going to do is Im going to make a class called enroll now this is gonna seem weird but what this enroll class is going to do for us and it will make more sense as we go through this video is essentially link our students and our courses so essentially we have a way to say ok this course is taught by this professor and this student is enrolled in this course the reason I want this enroll is because this enroll will essentially tell me if first of all if this course is active right you know is there enough people in this course that this student this enrollment was successful thats something we could keep track of on the in rural class and it can keep track of the grade that the student had in the course we need some way to keep track of all of the grades for all of the courses for all of the students and this enroll class could be a way to do this now keep in mind that I might change this as we go through and I start drawing things out it might make more sense to do something else but this is my initial idea and this is where Im starting from this is my starting ground and this is what Im thinking about right now and this is what you should think about when you are reading some requirements that look something like this okay so Ive settled on these four classes for right now these could change again Im trying to walk you through the process as fully as we can so you really understand and these are the four classes that I think Im gonna need student-professor course and this enroll one is gonna link those courses and those students together and store some information and it may be like the date we enrolled in the course something like that okay so now that I have that what Im gonna do is Im gonna spread these out and Im gonna start listing information that I need to keep track of for students professors and so on so now what Im gonna do is start looking at what information do I need for students so down here it says a student can be both local or international full or part-time so the first thing Im gonna say is well say local and that will be a boolean value thats either gonna be true or false is this student local or are they not and in fact what I actually might make this is just international international I think thats right and this will just tell me if the students international or not and that will tell me if theyre local right because its a true or false value so well keep that as an attribute of my student class thats some type of information were gonna need to know and then it says the student can either be full or part-time okay so we could consider that to be an attribute of the student whether theyre full or part-time but how is that attribute derived that is derived based on the number of courses that theyre enrolled in during a given semester so instead of making this an attribute what Im actually gonna do is say well something that I need on my student is gonna be a method and the method is gonna say is part-time and this will simply return a boolean and what this will do is it will look at this student and tell me how many courses are enrolled in and if it is greater than the threshold of the part-time student then they will not be a part-time student right that is what this method will do so things that we start thinking about is how are we gonna implement this kind of attribute well were gonna do that using a method so we can determine if a student is full or part-time okay so the maximum an amount courses a student may be enrolled in is six students receive grades okay and then what else does it say here if the average grade is lower than 60% theyre on academic probation so this one is derived from their grades so again since it is a derived attribute its not simply just something thats going to sit there what I need to do is have a method that tells me hey are they on probation so well say is on probation like that alright so well put that there and then this will be boolean and what these methods are intending to do is to look at attributes on the student evaluate them and then give us an answer to give us these kind of attitudes right are they part-time or are they on probation okay so now that we have that lets move to Professor dont worry theres a lot more stuff that Im gonna add in here but I want to talk about that later so professor what do we need here well a professor we need to keep track of their salaries so first thing well say is salary and this will be a number right were an int or whatever you want to call it well actually probably would be a float because they could have a decimal point salary so well put a salad right there what else do we need for a professor well theres nothing else on here that it really says we need other than their age name phone number etc which well get to in a second so for that Im gonna leave it there now of course what do we need for a course well it doesnt specifically say theres anything we really need for a course but what Im gonna have for a course of course is the name Im gonna have the course code because thats something that were probably gonna need the name will be a string the code will be a string as well actually and then what else do we need we need be minimum and maximum amount of students in the course well save min students thatll be an int and well say max students and that will be an int and then what Im actually gonna have is well we need to determine is this course active or is it canceled so is this going on do we have enough students in this course for it to happen so what are we gonna do were gonna add a method that says is active or will say is canceled just because that goes more with the requirements that we have there so well say is canceled boolean and what this will do is look at all of the students enrolled in this course and tell us if there is enough so its canceled or its not canceled right I hope that makes sense okay so we have student we have professor we have course another thing that Im thinking we might want to do is have something like the start time for this course it doesnt necessarily say that we need that but if Im thinking about my program in the future it probably makes sense to have something like start time right like when did this course start what you might want to keep track of it so well say start and well say thats a date and then while were at that we might as well put an end as well and well say that thats gonna be a date - so hopefully you get the idea that what Im doing is just going through and picking out all the necessary information and just listing it out so I can see it before I actually start drawing anything so we have student professor course and then we have enroll okay so enroll what do I need for enroll well this is gonna keep track of how my students are enrolled in courses so for enroll what Im gonna do is Im simply gonna say date so well literally say the date is gonna be a date so this is when this happened so when did they enroll were gonna need what students enrolled what course enrolled and then were also going to need B grade that the student got in that course this for me is pretty much gonna keep track of hey this student is enrolled in this course and this is the grade that they received in this course and that will be a float and then anything else that we might want to keep track of thats specific between a student and a course but doesnt make sense to go in just the student or just the course would be information we put in enroll and for now I dont think of anything so Im gonna leave it like this and this is kind of the core information I need except for this address phone number name and age now the reason Ive left this out is because these are gonna require some more classes notice that for both a student and a professor we have some shared functionality here we have some shared attributes we have the address the phone number the name and the age so what Im actually going to do is Im gonna make another class here Im gonna call it person and what this person class is gonna represent is a base class for both the student and the professor so the student the professor have some shared things that we want to know about them so lets put that into a base class that Im gonna call person so inside of person what Im gonna do here is say okay what do we need well we need the name so actually were gonna have to say first name oops if we could type here so first name thatll be a string were gonna say last name that will be a string as well what else do we need we need the age of this person so do I do age int like that Im gonna ask you as a question here I cant really because its not an interactive environment but think about if this age makes sense to put here does it make sense to have an attribute called age because we want to keep track of the age right it says we need the age in this person class so think about it for a second okay Im assuming youve thought about it and Im gonna tell you right now that it makes no sense to put an attribute called age which is an int the reason you never put an attribute called age on something is because an age changes and guess what an age is derived from your birthdate so on the current date versus your birth date that determines your age so rather than keeping track of the age we want to keep track of the date of birth which will tell us the age right we can very easily find the age if we have the date of birth so this is gonna be a date so that was a little bit of a trick I put in there just to see if I could fool you guys okay next thing we need is a phone number so lets say phone number if we can do this like this so phone number and that is gonna be a what is this I guess we could call it Im gonna call it a string just because we can have like the plus one - yada yada yada there might be a specific attribute we could use for that but a string its fine I think you guys get that all right now we need B address so what is it in address comprised of though is my question here these address really an attribute that I can put can I just put a dress like that well the answer is yes you can do that but what I usually like to do just to make things easier for myself in the future is make a separate class called address and it stores all of the information in separate fields about the address so this way I can very easily grab information from the address I can sort by people that are living in a certain area it just makes things a lot easier especially if youre thinking about a database structure in the future if you have a bunch of attributes that could be squished in one separate out into individual fields lets look at this address what is an address well we need a country we need kind of a state or a province Ill just call it a state but like it could be a province that might make more sense were going to need a street well need a street number so we could call this the street address and that could be one thanks we need country states were going to need a city we need the street address and then we need a postal code or zip code or something like that so lets just go postal code now these country this is gonna be a string almost all of these are gonna be strings actually this is gonna be a string this is gonna be a string I think almost all of these are gonna be strings and the postal code will be a string as well so those string and street address needs to be one word okay so now we have information relate to an address if we wanted to add some more information about address like maybe you wanted to get really specific and go long gets you latitude something like that you could technically add that to this class and now what we kind of have and let me go over here and make this a bit bigger is all of the information that we needed out of this problem right here Ive kind of taken it out Ive read through everything we needed to and Ive said the information I need to store is the following I need an address that has all of this I need a person that has all that I need a student a professor a course and in enroll class that stores the date and the grid awesome now the next thing to consider is what we call associations so Ive listed all the attributes specific to these classes but these classes can associate with each other in fact you know the address is going to belong to a person right each person needs to have an address a student is going to be enrolled in a course through this enroll class a professor is going to be teaching a course so how do we go about and do that well this is where we use associations now associations are different from attributes they are a way of linking two objects together and the next part of what were gonna do here is pretty much determine how we want to associate all of these objects and once we draw that out and we have the associations dont be focused on the implementation in code just be focused on how these objects interact with each other because if we can understand and that we can very easily implement that into code later on using whatever programming language we want and thats why youll notice you know Im not using STR like Ive normally would in Python Im just writing things that are descriptive enough that anybody in any programming language could look at this and translate this into some kind of working implementation so lets keep this on the side of our screen here Ill make it a little bit smaller and Im gonna pop up actually one note and start doing some drawing so let me grab my drawing tab and Ill be right back alright so Ive shut off my camera here just to give us the most amount of screen real estate as possible and what Im gonna do is Im gonna start Im gonna start by apologizing for my drawing skills because they are very poor but Im actually going to draw what weve just kind of done on the left hand side of the screen here and put it into a visual picture so we can actually see whats going on so I want to draw all of these classes and Ill tell you what all of the things that Im drawing mean and then what well do is actually link them up just using a lines so essentially Im gonna draw all these little boxes that look like this you know Im gonna write here this is a person and then Ill put in all of the associations for that person then well have another class over here and what a line like this means is an association so essentially this person interacts with this other class and what we can do is put little numbers and symbols on this Association to tell us what this Association is is this a one-to-one Association which means one class links to one other class or does this mean this one class could look to many other classes is there a limitation on the amount it can link to well thats what were gonna put here and the idea is that you can write two numbers so if you write one number what this states is that is the amount of associations so when I write one this is saying that this person class one of it can link to many which is what the Asterix stands for of whatever this class over here might be if I write something like 1 dot dot - so say lets replace this with 1 dot dot - what this means is that we could have one or two person classes if I write one dot dot asterisks this says the minimum we can have is 1 the maximum we can have is infinite if I write just in asterisks which is just my crappy star like this this means we can have as many or as little of whatever is on this side as we want so I hope that makes sense it will make more sense as we go through this but I just wanted to give you a little definition for we go too far all right so lets delete that lets get back into this so the first class and Im actually gonna draw is my person class now remember my person class is gonna be a base class so let me just up this pen size a little bit to make a little bit easier so lets draw a class like this Im gonna try very hard to keep this neat enough that you can read but it is hard to do with the drawing tablet so were gonna say thats person and what does a person have on it first name last name date of birth phone number now just to keep this video shorter Im gonna avoid writing the actual type of what these are so Im not gonna write string and all that Im just gonna write the actual name of the attribute so well say here this is first name okay so what I do a little - like this what Im saying is this is an attribute so Im essentially saying this is some piece of information that is contained within this class so Im saying first name Im gonna say a last name like that what else do we need date of birth okay date of birth next we need a phone number okay so lets go there all right I dont think thats too bad thank you guys can kind of read that so there we go person first name last name date of birth the phone number okay now this a member is the base class for my student and for my professor so in order to illustrate that what Im gonna do is Im gonna draw two more classes underneath this and Im gonna show you kind of a fancy arrow that we can use to illustrate that this is a base class and this is a generalization so Im going to draw my two classes here this is gonna be one for my student so Ill say actually student will go on the other side sorry actually maybe not lets just leave student here student and this will be professor like that okay so we have our student and we have our professor now lets write what we need inside of here so for our professor we just had the salary and for our students we had what is it international okay so international and then we had two methods on our student now usually you do a method using a plus sign what this says essentially is this is a public method everyone else can see this there might be more methods on the student or on the professor in the future but if they are not public we dont write them down because were just interested in what you know all of these classes how theyre gonna interact together and what they can see on each other so we have student and well say is part time put some brackets and well say on probation Im just gonna write probation just to make it a little bit shorter will write probation and well have two brackets again if you cant read any of this look on the side thats why I typed it out now to illustrate that these are actually going to be a generalization so that this is the base class for those two other classes what you do is you simply do an arrow like this that is not filled in and you just do a little line to these two classes so what this says essentially is that this student and this professor are derived from this person class so they are children class of this base class person now what this means is essentially that they have all of these same attributes and functionality as this person class so any associations that are made between person and some other class will apply to both of these classes because they are a generalization of this class theyre just a specific instance of a person right I hope that makes sense so lets say we had a teaching assistant then all we would do is just go like this and now all we have to add is anything specific to the teaching assistant if we want them to be a derived classroom person so that is as easy as that is and this is a very common thing when youre designing systems to have a base class that represents kind of the core functionality and then have specific instances or specific classes underneath that that have the additional functionality you need so we have persons student professor what do we need next we need an address now who hasnt addressed well a student and a professor both have an address so what Im gonna do up here is Im gonna draw my address like this and just butcher all of this once again okay so address like that and lets go here and lets write what we need for the address we have a country okay we have a city we have a state which I forgot and then Im just gonna put dot dot dot you get the point we have a street address and a postal code I dont think I need to go through all of it I think you guys get the point now what Im gonna do is actually draw our first Association so what I just did down here is called a generalization now that means that these things are not associated they are actually like the same thing right like a student is a person and a professor is a person so that is why they are called a generalization when we do this kind of arrow like that now what in association is is a solid line between two classes that says hey every time I make one of these classes I can potentially have this one linked up to it in some way and now what I do is I define the multiplicity is what its called of my association so essentially how many of these things can be associated together well it turns out that one person can actually have multiple addresses right that is very possible that they have multiple addresses so what Im gonna do is Im gonna say one person here because an address can only belong to one person will say one address is unique to one person although in theory thats not correct you could have brothers or something that have the same address but for our system were going to assume that this address object maybe therell be one thats exactly the same thats totally fine but they will only belong to one person they will not be attached to two different people in other words we wont have person one here in person to here pointing to the same address that wont ever happen they will be two unique objects so were gonna say one and then here Im actually going to say asterisks and what Im gonna do is say one dot dot which essentially says that one person must have at least one address but they can have as many as they want so the lower bound is one the upper bound is infinite which means this person could have infinite amount of addresses we dont know where theyre gonna live or how many addresses they have and they have to have at least one or they have to at least tell us about one for us to enter them into the system so when you see something like this this says that as soon as I make a person I must create an address that is associated with that person and same thing over here on address this says whenever I make an address I must have a person that is associated with that address as easy as it is that is the first Association we need and in fact were actually getting close to finish this program so we have our person our student our professor and our address the next thing we need is a course now Im running out of screen real estate a bit so Im gonna just do the course over here which is kind of on the edge of my drawing tablet so its hard to write accurately but will write course and then what do we have for a course well we actually had a bunch Ill just write a few of this straightforward ones here so we had name we had code we had min so Im just gonna short these min max and then Ill just write we had a start and end Ill just write the method is canceled for now but again you guys get the point that is the information we would have had so is cancelled with two brackets okay now what do we need well guess what we have professors that are teaching courses so we need to have an association between our professor and our course so that we know that this professor is teaching this course right so what Im gonna do is simply draw a line from professor to course Im gonna say course well put one like that and then on professor how many professors teach a course well it said at least one professor teaches a course but sometimes there may be many so Im gonna write one dot dot asterisks like that which essentially says one course is associated with one or many professors and every time we make a professor we must have it associated with a course wait I dont know if that sounds correct whenever we have a professor it must be teaching a course thats not necessarily true we could have a professor that doesnt teach a course that is a possibility of our system so what Im gonna do now is on course go zero dot dot one which essentially says we can have one professor teaching this course but we also might not have any professor sorry all the way around a professor might teach a course but they also might not teach a course and in fact now that Im looking at it does only one course make sense because what this then is a professor can only teach at most one course no thats actually wrong so what I need to do is change this over here now to be a star because it could have a professor could be teaching a course it could be teaching many courses it might not be teaching any at all so lets erase this and lets change this to a star now I know that just was like a big you know run around in circles and me doing everything except the right answer but the point here is that thats what you want to think about Im bringing you through these scenarios so that you can understand how you approach a problem like this and how you think about those kind of edge cases when you make your associations on here you want to be very careful to design for flexibility if you think the system in the future might do what youre limiting it to be able to do maybe dont limit it to do that its better to have a system that is more flexible than to be super robust and super defined to the requirements because the requirements do change and part of designing is designing for scalability and flexibility all right so the next class we have is enroll and this actually happens to be the last class but this is actually one of the more complicated ones and this is what Im gonna call an association class so Im gonna draw it over here and Im gonna call this and roll so lets say enroll like that and inside of here were gonna have a date and what else are we gonna have were gonna have the grade the student received from the course okay so this is gonna be what we call an association class now an association class is a little bit different than a regular class because what it does is link to other classes together which means this never exists on its own it always has an association between a course and a student and the whole point of it is to link a course and a student together so we draw it a little bit differently than we draw most regular classes so what Im gonna do here is draw an association between my student and my course its getting a little bit messy now I apologize for that but we do have an association now between the student and the course and lets pick the multiplicity and then I will talk about how enroll actually operates here so the multiplicity could be that a student can be enroll enrolled in multiple courses and a course can have multiple students in it so what Im gonna say here is first of all on this side were gonna put many because a course can have many students enrolled in it it might have zero I might have infinite right it might have maximum then what we need to have next is okay well how many courses can a student be enrolled in well they can be enrolled in zero so they could technically be enrolled in zero courses let me redraw that because I kind of butchered it and a maximum is six so the maximum amount of courses that can be enrolled in is six so essentially what Ive said is that the lower bound is zero the maximum is six which means that can be in any range in between that and based on the amount of courses theyre enrolled in well that is gonna tell us if they are part-time or if they are full-time right that is how were gonna drive that now this is where the Association class comes in so what Im actually gonna do is draw a dotted line and Ill redraw that again just to make it more clear actually over here between this Association and the in rural class what this says is this Association is really enroll hitting course and student hitting enroll right so this is just like this enroll class has an association between course and students and we use that to be able to determine what courses a student is enrolled in that that is the idea behind this intermediate class it stores an association with course it stores an association with student and then it also stores some attributes on it that are very useful for example date this tells us that whenever we create an association between student and course we must pick a date that this happened at so we know when the student enrolled in this course right that makes a lot of sense and you can now determine say if a student was late to enroll in the course because on course if you look over here we have the start and the end date left-hand side of my screen and we can compare the date that they enrolled in to the start and the end then we have great well that tells us what grade they got in this enrolled course and since theres an association between course and enroll and student and enroll what we can actually have is we can have the professor update the grade of a student so think about how this works right if I need to update the grade of a student well the professor has an association to course the course has an association to enroll and enroll has an association to all of the students right so in this way what I can do is I can have the professor look at the course look at all of the students enrolled and then go into this enroll class and modify the grade this way the professor does not actually get to look at any of the personal information of the student to upgrade it its great all it has to do is look at this enroll Association class and say hey all I need to do here is change the grade and then that will automatically update for the course and for the student and whats great about this is well since every single student is associated to the course with an enroll class if I want it to do something like get the average grade of the course all I would do is look at all the associations between student and one specific course look at that enroll class and then grab all of those grades so this is the kind of system that I designed and that we were trying to design from the beginning something that is flexible and that can do a bunch of operations that may not have been defined yet but that we probably want to do in the future so that is pretty much it for this design I need to erase this one line here I dont think that was supposed to be there but this is our finalized design and I apologize that is super messy but the point of this video is not to be like you know the most perfect the most robust its to teach you the process of looking at a software system and designing it from the ground up starting from scratch extracting the necessary information translating that information and then drawing a somewhat you know kind of plan drawing a design that we can actually go ahead now and implement because if you think about it now all you have to do if you want to make this system is look at this and start implementing what Ive defined and if you actually look at this as not very complicated right weve broken everything down into classes which you can write weve broken it down into methods and weve broken it down into attributes so you dont even really have to think now when you go about programming this you just have to look at this design and follow it and if theres something that needs to be changed make that change accordingly right if we want to implement person all I do is make a class called person add a constructor that has these four arguments and there we go Ive made person all right I want student and professor lets have them extend the person class lets go okay add an international attribute add these two methods is part-time is on probation professor lets add a salary there we go Oh associations okay great lets handle these associations lets make a private field in each of these that stores the association between address or something like that right and that is as easy as it is to do now the last thing I will say here just because some people might be confused on how these associations are implemented when you have a one-to-one Association you can think of that just like another attribute so let me actually I dont want to erase all of this but let me just do something like up here in this little area essentially lets say person has a one-to-one association with address so imagine that this is actually one what that means is on the person class we have another attribute called address I dont need to write it because the associations infer that and what this is really equal to is an address object right its equal to some instance of address and then that way if we want to access the address of a person I just call person dot address now this is the exact same thing on address so let me erase this if this is one-to-one then on side of address right this has an attribute that says person so this just says person right and then it points to a person object and there you go that way the address if it wanted to see the person it could the person wants to see the address they can write that is how a one-to-one Association happens now sometimes you might not store it on the address side it really depends but now lets say we have this one-to-many right then what we would do is on here wed have another attribute it would be called addresses like that and it would just be equal to a list that stored all of the addresses inside of it thats as easy as it is and that is what Im talking about when I say Association its just a link between these two objects you implement that link however you want but usually its done just with another attribute or with something in the actual class itself and that is how you can link these different things together so with that being said that has been this video I know this is not you know the most I dont want to say educational but this is really just the way of teaching you about how to think about this its just the way of training your brain to look at information break it down and throw it into some kind of design that you can then go ahead and implement so like I said at the beginning if you want to see the code for this leave a like subscribe to the channel comment spam me let me know and I will try my best to make a video where we implement this exact design so that being said I hope you enjoyed if you did leave it like subscribe and I will see you in the next YouTube video
