Like right now Im running a machine learning model that will tell me how bad I suck at video games in real time. But honestly I dont think its very accurate. Nevermind. Its pretty accurate. So machine learning, its hot right now. Its the future Chads, G P T, all the buzzword, you know, and its how you ended up watching this video. Thank you YouTube algorithm. Love you. And Im making this video because I wanna tell you, you can absolutely learn this technology. You dont need a degree, you dont need to be a math genius and you can learn this all for free. This video game thing, youre actually gonna set this up yourself by the end of this video using all the crazy machine learning data science tools in the Oracle Cloud or oci and it will be completely free thanks to our sponsor Oracle. And by the way, youll find out that if you do wanna get started with machine learning, this right here is the best way to start. Just jump in and stink and do it using real tools that real data scientists and machine learning engineers actually use. Im telling you about machine learning, but Im not a machine learning engineer. Why should you listen to me? Santiago, hes a machine learning engineer. In fact, you know that dog spot from Boston Dynamics jumps around, sees things sometimes piece beer into a cup, Santiagos on the team that makes that happen. Its machine learning and specifically its called computer vision. We. Build computer vision algorithms to help the robot see the. World. And also Nacho, hes a machine learning engineer. Hes the guy whos gonna help you get set up with that machine learning video game thing later on. I created like three workshops and the idea is to get started on the most basic concepts that I found out that are, you know, most important in, in machine learning. And theyre both gonna help me explain the wonders of machine learning and how you can get started down this kind of crazy and extremely lucrative career path. I mean talk about future proof dude. And by the way, Im obsessed with machine learning now. I cant stop playing with it. So thanks a lot Oracle. But before we get into that, lets first define what the junk even is. Machine learning. Santiago, what is machine learning? Machine learning is Teaching a computer how to learn from data. Like if youre a software developer, youre used to uh, craft a set of rules in order to accomplish something, right? Lets say you want to play tic-tac toe, you will uh, create rules like if the computer plays here, Im gonna play there. If the other player plays here, right? You will craft those rules. You will use, uh, loops and conditions and any programming, uh, tools that you have. Mm-hmm machine learning is a little bit different and it turns this on its head. So machine learning starts with uh, a lot of samples, right? Its like hey, this is the temperature over a year for this particular region. Can you craft the rules automatically in order to predict what the temperature will be tomorrow? So. Were teaching a computer to do something without us explicitly telling it to do something. If youre like me, youre like, uh, what , what does that mean exactly? Whats the process? How does that work? Let me give you one quick example before we dive in. Well start by defining our, what do we want to teach the computer? And I wanna teach how to identify a photo of me. Is this a photo of network chuck? Yes or no? But how do we do that? How do we teach it to recognize me data, the answers data, we give it a ton of pictures of me, different pictures, me doing this and that. Then nah, you know, all kinds of stuff and well label it so it knows its me and while were at it, it also might help to see photos of not me so we can know what to not look for. So well get a bunch of those of not me with our data assembled. We can now train our computer. Hes in training, hes a trainee. But hold up before we can teach him, we have to choose how hes going to learn. And thats called our machine learning algorithm. There are a lot out there doing some crazy math, but I think the one we want will be a convolutional neural network. Now do I know how that works? No. But do I know that it might be good for the situation? Yes. So now we spoon feed the data and the algorithm will start to learn to start recognizing the pattern of me. Every time it sees a beard or crazy eyes or a man bun, itll say, oh you know what? Im gonna weigh that feature higher. Or if it doesnt see one, itll lower it and it will crunch through all this data learning me. And then for good measureable feed to pictures of not me, so it knows what to not look for. And now hes done, he finished the training data, hes no longer a trainee. Now we can test him with testing data to see how he performs. Now while this example is very simple, thats all a machine learning model is, which is what we just make. Its a file thats been trained to recognize certain types of patterns. Now it could happen that your machine learning model sucks and its accuracy is like 10%. Thats where being a machine learning engineer comes into play. You have to learn what to do to make that model more accurate. You have to learn those skills and Im gonna show you how to do it right now. Now according to Santiago, the first step in learning machine learning is just to start doing. It. I prefer the style of teaching and learning where you start writing the deep end and then you start unpacking things, breaking down pieces and say, okay, I need this in order to understand this particular piece. Let me go and watch a that video. Or I need this. Uh, I do not understand exactly how the chain rule works. Let me just pick up this video, go to YouTube or whatever. Im gonna understand that and then I can move on. Thats the way I would recommend people to approach this. So lets just start doing it, shall we? Lets build a machine learning algorithm that can tell you how bad you suck at video games. Check the link below. Lets get signed up for a free Oracle cloud account. Oci. And by the way, signing up for OCI right now means you get a $300 credit to do whatever you stink and want with within reason more than enough to play with this machine learning stuff. So once you have your account, we got three delicious labs to go through. I created like three workshops that are uh, you can do them on your own about uh, one hour and a half to two hours. And the idea is to get started on the most basic concepts that I found out. And they cover everything from data extraction, getting your data ready like we do with the photos, to actually building models with different tools. Psych kittle, learn, auto glue on even building a neural network who can say they built a neural network. You can after this thing youre doing coffee break. The first one Im gonna start with is data extraction. The CUS is gonna teach you a ton about data science as were walking through this. Once you got it loaded up, go ahead and click on start and then click on run on your tendency, which just means youre gonna be running on your own OCI stuff cuz you have free account. Now you probably guessed that the video game were talking about is League of Legends. Its kind of a complex game. Its you playing with four other players to try and destroy the other players base essentially. And there are a lot of factors that come into play. What character you choose, the potions and nerdy stuff you might buy, how much gold you collect, uh, all the stuff that happens in the match. All those are in things that are important features that might determine if youre going to win or lose. And its in this lab we learn how to identify those features and feed it into a machine learning algorithm. Its kind of crazy. Now if you are following along with this lab, the first thing you wanna do is set up your infrastructure in oci. Well be using a lot of stuff there. Data science cloud, shell compute, autonomous js o database. Offer free offer fun. No, it really is pretty cool. Oh, and one more thing you wanna do is youll wanna sign up for League of Legends because youre gonna get an API key to pull all kinds of data from previous matches and live matches as youre playing. Its free, its easy just youll link below, youll, youll follow it along for the infrastructure. Were doing all of this deploy with Terraform and Ansible. Nacho gives you all the code, everything in this walkthrough. You dont have to worry about a thing, just click, click, click. You probably wont even know whats happening half the time and thats fine. Youre just deploying infrastructure. Just follow directions. Im gonna do mine right now. Now number two, the next thing youll want to do to become a machine learning engineer and that is to learn why the junk data science. Like why do we do it? What is it? Whats the process? The first thing you wanna do is hang out with nacho nachos gonna hold your hand and show you what its like to actually tackle a real world machine learning problem. And using the OCI hands-on labs, youll get hands-on to actually do this yourself. And this is so cool because you get a chance to see how a machine learning engineer thinks how they approach a problem. Shoot, hes got five articles detailing it, every single thing he does and why he did it. So if you want to understand the big what and why of machine learning, this is like the best place to start. Youre doing it and hes telling you why. And if you need a bit more, which I often do, there is some structure learning out there for how to understand the whole machine learning process. Santiago recommends brilliant. If. You are like from the very, very, very beginning, like youve never seen this, you, you dont even know where to start, I would recommend brilliant. They have a data science path thats fantastic. Itll help you to start thinking like a data scientist. Now this is for you if youre very brand new to data science, like you dont even know what Im saying right now. This is a paid option but according to Santiago its fantastic. Like. I won my eight years old to take it. Is is that uh, basic right? But its a great star thats gonna just give you an idea what you need to face. So I would love that path. The point of this step is to get you to understand the whole point of data science and to start like a data scientist, which is important for machine learning, but also from step one going deep with our example on Oracle Cloud. Again, were looking at the Game League of Legends and how we can predict the winner of a match and its getting in the mindset of how to figure that out that makes this lab so crazy valuable. Cuz as I mentioned, league of Legends is kind of complex. So well need to look at the game and identify features that will affect the outcome of a match. So things like what champion you choose, what lane you pick, how much gold you earn, how many minions you kill, all kinds of things. So taking all that and figuring that stuff out and using machine learning tools to do it. Dont miss this. Try this out. And in the first workshop were actually learning how to extract that data to get it from the Riot Games api, which Im going to do right now. Which by the way, what were doing in the data extraction process, the lab, according to Santiago and Nacho, this is like 70 to 80% of the machine learning engineer job. Its getting the data, the right data, preparing it, making it look nice and neat so that when you give it to your machine learning algorithm, it can learn a lot, learn well. So right here Im pulling a bunch of data down from the API and Im telling you, this lab is so cool because youre learning what it takes to predict this kind of thing. So right now were collecting historical data, bunch of data on previous professional game matches. So were pulling all the professional players and all the matches theyve played in and just so much data about each of those things with a goal of then giving that data to an algorithm to crunch it and figure out whos going to win. Now while were pulling in this data, I think its important to point out the third thing youll need to become a machine learning engineer. And that is a little bit of Python and actually a slightly more than a little, youll want an intermediate level of Python expertise. If you dont know what Python is, its a programming language used by most of it at this point. And when it comes to data science and machine learning, its the darling. Its what people use. The how do machine learning engineers use Python? Well, in this example right now Im actually pulling match information from the Array games api, but Im doing that with Python code. Heres the code right here. This code is a function thats getting player information from the Riot Games api. Then we had to use more code to pretty at the data a bit to prepare it for our machine learning algorithm to where we end up with something like this. We didnt get the data like this, we had to shape it and form it with code. So I do wanna point out that you dont have to be a Python expert, you dont have to develop actual Python software. But scripting, doing intermediate things is something you want to learn. Now how do you learn it? Ton of free resources out there. Paid options are always good. They give you a structured process, it pro TV Code Academy. I also have a Python course freely available on YouTube and progress. But youll learn a ton. And of course there are other Python videos on YouTube. Now at this point you do know a thing YouTube about machine learning, youve dabbled with it, you know some Python, so youre pretty dangerous. Now its time for Kaggle. Step four, Santiago recommends a course on Kaggle. The intro to machine learning. This course right here, I believe its free. You dont even have to log in, which is kind of crazy. And this will take you into that next step of machine learning, giving you a good base and doing this will actually help you in the OCI lab. If we look back at our League of Legends lab here in oci, Im actually gonna access the data science section. And if you went through the data extraction lab, you already have a data science project and a League of Legends notebook session here at our OCI data science environment, we have a Jupiter notebook which will give us a a real taste of what being a machine learning engineer is actually kinda like. Because again, this is tools they actually use. Jupiter notebooks are amazing by the way, if youve never used them. And we got it built in right here into oci. Through this process, youre gonna get to see use and experience things like pandas, num pie, matt plot lib, all things youre gonna learn through your data science courses. But in real life and stuff youll see what it looks like to split your data into test and training data sets. Now step five, youre not gonna like this one math, you cant escape it. It is part of this. The good news is that you dont have to learn a crazy amount according to Santiago. All you have to do is learn high school level math. You. Have like, lets say high school, uh, math. You can get into machine learning, amica stuff as you need it. I also asked Nacho, do you have to go back to college to learn all this math stuff? No, I mean I couldnt, um, disagree more , you have a base, but uh, its not a hundred percent required. You dont need a PhD or anything or you dont need to know deep math to know how to use something. Now. If you remember everything from high school and you took more advanced classes in high school than I did, youre probably fine. But if youre like me, you probably need to go back and brush up a bit. Statistics, probability, calculus, those kind of things. Thankfully theres a ton of stuff out there to learn math now. Like theres brilliance, which has a high school math thing,  whole course here. You can also go to Khan Academy. Theres YouTube. Limitless opportunity to learn math. Do you absolutely need it for machine learning? You could probably get by a lot of the tools youll use in machine learning. Abstract away the math. So you dont necessarily need it, but its super helpful to understand whats happening, to understand the algorithms youre using and why use them. Youll see as youre going through this League of Legends lab that theres math involved. Now after youre brushed up on your math, now its time to move on to the big stuff. Santiago, tell em about Andrew Inc. The machine learning specialization. By the way, the previous version of it was the most popular machine learning course in the world ever with millions of enrollments. He redid that last year. Its great. He starts from scratch, but hes not afraid of the math and you shouldnt be either. So. This is a machine learning specialization on Coursera. Its got three courses and it is going to make you awesome. I believe it is free unless you want a certification, a certificate. Now at this point, dude, youve learned a ton about machine learning and just like a good machine learning model, its time to tweak your model, your head , you gotta get better at this. Thats what Im trying to say. Its time to hone your skills. And for that, theres no better way than just getting more hands-on experience. Take all that youve learned and do it again and again and again. And one of the best ways is again, the OCI hands-on labs we have access to right now. One thing youll find out and learning machine learning is that Nacho has a really solid example, but he invites you to tweak it to make it better. Because as youll see, the models pretty cool. Like its, its, its pretty accurate, but it could be better. So you need to figure out, hey, how can I add more features? How can I make the data better? How can I get more data? Maybe Ill choose a different algorithm and keep practicing until you get better results. Thats machine learning. And maybe League of Legends is not your thing. It certainly wasnt mine before this. Now Im kind of addicted. Take another game. See if they have an api, pull the data, play with it. Go crazy. Another option for practice is Kaggle. Once again, they have competitions, data science competitions, which is kind of crazy. And what this looks like is theyll give you data sets and theyll say, Hey, uh, predict things better than all these other people. And if you can do that, if you can use your machine learning skills, theres prize money, a hundred thousand dollars 60, like what is this? But anyways, youll come back here to start practicing your data science and machine learning skills. The cool thing about Kaggle is they already have the data there. The hard part most of the time with machine learning is gathering the data. Theyve got the data sets. And I would say at this point, you know, machine learning, youre at a point where you can start to build your own models, build your own portfolio, and start looking for jobs. Who knows, you might get hired on as a junior intern, whatever. So these eight steps, this path will teach you what you need to know to become a machine learning engineer. You dont need college, you dont need to be a math genius. You can do this. And even if you dont want to become a machine learning engineer, just going through these labs, which is free from oci, thank you, Oracle does just let you know whats out there. Like it or not, machine learning is the future. And who knows, you might have a knack for. Now, back to League of Legends, if you followed along, you collected your data, you trained your model, and set up the model to run locally on your computer like I am here. Which by the way, nacho again has all this as a walkthrough. He details in GitHub how to do it in oci. He walks you through every step, including the local machine situation. At this point, you can predict how quickly youre going to lose this game like I am. So please actually let me know if you set this up. I would love to know.
