complicated lets make it easier to understand [Applause] [Music] hello world mike plogger back with my good pal and infographic genius visme today were talking data visualization in todays day and age visuals are your best friends when it comes to presenting data spreadsheets powerpoints and lengthy word documents are no more with average attention spans seeming to shorten by the day you must be able to tell your story through data in a manner thats easy for the consumer to understand but how can you do that hi visby and i are here to help and in this video were going to answer all of your questions regarding data visualization what exactly they are how you can use them different examples and more get out your pen and paper and lets begin shall we lets start with what data visualization is while the term sounds scary a data visualization is meant to make understanding information easier its just a graphical representation of data rather than presenting data in a complex spreadsheet you can create an image that will illustrate the information in a simpler way viewers dont have to scour a fact sheet looking for the story they can easily scan and quickly find what theyre looking for and you dont have to be a data genius to create them anyone and everyone can create them no matter their profession marketers teachers health care professionals consider this infographic here your profession is not an excuse to not create data visualizations you can create so much value for your audience by spending just a little bit of extra time building them i just mentioned creating value for your audience lets dive into four ways of doing so the first reason is how easy it makes data to digest you can write a full report if youd like and hope that your audience reads it all the way through to understand your point or you can create an infographic like this which is still somewhat complex but simplifies the information in an easy to understand manner imagine if all of this was written in paragraph form yikes the second reason is the ability to discover patterns easier trends emerge from data over time and if you monitor that data through graphics theyre much easier to notice scatter plots or charts can help you identify them and then once you do present them with an infographic similar to this one i havent mentioned this yet but all the examples youll see in this video are templates you can edit in visme right now so keep them in mind if youve been learning or gathering information for a long period of time a data visualization can help you compile that information into one place its more engaging and an image is always easier to remember than text alone which is our fourth reason the visual nature of a data visualization helps viewers understand and remember it better theyll soak in that image like a sponge and will be able to recall the information that went with it this is a detailed infographic about bioluminescence in australia the geographical image makes it easier to remember where its present in where its not along australias eastern coast all right we have our feet wet in the data visualization pond lets get a little bit deeper now and explore five ways data visualization can be used one is to plan schedules are you familiar with google calendar well thats become a data visualization you can layout a timeline or project plan for your days or months whether through google or on your own if youre on deadline a visualization showing what needs to happen before the big day is a great idea i suggest starting at the end and working backwards another way data visualization is used is to pinpoint relationships how are two or more things related this is when a scatter plot becomes your new best friend if time is one of the variables in your data a graphic can help share changes over that time period by recognizing the trends from the past your data visualization will help you predict what outcomes to expect in the future frequency falls in line with predictive ability as well after youve compiled so much data youll have an idea of the frequency you can expect something this will require a lot of research but will be helpful for both yourself and your viewers and our last way that data visualizations are typically used is to interpret value and risk rather than sorting through pages of information a simple data visualization can help you assess a situation and determine if taking action is necessary your brain can process multiple variables much more easily in an infographic than it can in a page full of text all right youve heard me touch on various types of data visualizations already to haunt any confusion and answer any questions lets touch on some of the most popular start with graphs let me preface this by saying there are dozens of graphs you can choose from for the sake of this video im only going to share a couple of the most popular pie charts were our best friend in third grade and well you should reconnect after all these years if you have seven or less percentage points and their differences in value are wide use a pie chart theyre simple and everyone understands them bar charts are another good example for easily understood data visualizations they mostly speak for themselves and im sure youve seen them before again if youre thinking theres no way you can create these visme has your back this is a template right here that you can edit to fit your data right now at visme.com line charts take one fixed value and however many variables and place them adjacent to one another these are perfect to discover trends or to see how one variable may be superior or inferior to another three prominent charts that you can use include pyramid charts stacked area charts and radar charts pyramid charts showcase visual hierarchy they can illustrate income importance or the difference between leads and actual sales as we see here stacked area charts are similar to your line charts theyll visualize changes over different values over time theres not one fixed variable here and the last chart i want to put on your radar is the radar chart you may have also heard these by the name of spyder or web charts but it looks something like this theyre great for identifying if something is well-rounded or maybe lacking in one specific area against other competition infographics rely on text a bit more than a standard data visualization its still kept to a minimum but it might be necessary depending on the type of infographic one example is a timeline infographic these will have some text but you can follow along easier knowing exactly when events were taking place by actually seeing it along the timeline an informational infographic will carry a lot more text and may even feature multiple data visualizations all in one graphic youll want icons colors and charts but dont overload the graphic and make it too overwhelming keep it organized like we see with this visme template and while theres plenty more infographics to check out which i encourage you to do so for the sake of time i just want to touch on comparison infographics this is for side-by-side comparisons of data helping you or your audience make informed decisions theyre great for comparing cars homes or banks as we see here as we near the end of this video i want to leave you with five tips for creating the absolute best data visualization that you can first know your audience understand their knowledge and if theyll be able to comprehend a complex visual or if youll need to simplify it are you talking to high schoolers or experienced professionals or are you presenting a spider chart to your hr department or your communications team the hr department will recognize it right away because they have more experience with it communications may not thats another reason why you need to choose the right data visualization as i mentioned a pie chart would not be great for data points that are very similar thats when youd want a bar chart a stacked bar chart is good for comparing maybe two to three variables but any more than that and a comparison chart becomes your friend some quick design tips for you if you follow our channel youve probably heard me say these before but dont use more than three fonts keep the sizing to between 8 and 20 point fonts select colors that are easy on the eyes and complement each other well pro tip blue and purple green and brown blue and gray and green and gray are combos that color blind people cant make out so consider that when reviewer reads a chart they may need a legend to help them understand what exactly theyre looking at a legend is what will tell them how to read the chart at the very least they can show what colors mean what like they do in this chart always consider putting a legend along your charts and you know i couldnt end this video without encouraging you to use visme for your data visualization needs visme can help you
