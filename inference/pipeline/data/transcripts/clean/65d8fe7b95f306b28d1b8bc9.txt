the webinar so uh im antholon in charge of the human computer attraction major at old university im really happy to be here its the first webinar that i do in this this role and ive put together a presentation that goes over the contents and the requirements and some opportunities that we have and overall just gives a flavor of of how we think and approach teaching here if you have questions i i guess were going to be taking them after the talk so um please uh meanwhile of course you can put them into chat well be moderating a q a after that um couldnt make it today but hes my deputy so hes associate professor of game ai and game design at elder school of uh sciences and now the school of arts is jointly appointed between these two schools im at the school of electrical engineering and as you see were hosting this program together uh with this uh two schools ski and elec and im in charge of the user interfaces group uh if youre interested in what we do you can you can look at our page ill just put the link here but from now on im going to be talking about the program and the major so um first of all ill go through all the universities just know who we are and uh whats our mode of operation and and whats our mission and vision and then im going to talk about the major and how thats constructed and what kind of courses you will be facing if you come here and what kind of opportunities you will be having during the course season and of course after that um first of all a couple of words about aldo so alde was formed roughly about 10 years ago and it had this mission of breaking boundaries that you you would normally have uh if you think about universities and their departments and faculties and and so on and try to have a constellation and that can address some some of these societally important challenges like sustainability and creativity in in novel ways and uh heres a timeline of where the different universities come from that came together to become old university roughly roughly 10 years 10 years ago and one one of the things that were really proud of is our internationality so maybe honey knows the statistics better that we have a strong contribution from international students and research faculty as well i cant remember the exact proportions but were talking about 30 40 percent across the board that are the figures i cannot remember then exactly but yeah we are one of the most uh international universities in europe so yeah thats really visible because weve been also growing our attractiveness in terms of students and the research faculty intake so so you see that whenever we open anything there we get you know lots of different uh lots of applications around the world and that has helped us sort of ramp up the quality of everything that we do here and um you know partial partially thats because um of the mission that we have that people find very very um inspiring the other thing that i want to raise up is our startup scene which is also really strong [Music] you know around the compost that we have in um in espo if you if you look at two two kilometer diameter somebody said that we have roughly 100 companies there in addition we have uh events like slash and lots of uh business incubators and so on and students have lots of opportunities to join these startups if theyre interested in those um so its more more than just a degree its its a its a its an experience and also theres very lively communities that are formed around uh students and and uh international visitors and and so on and of course that has been a bit of a hiatus because of the covet but nowhere i think were approaching status quo soon there are many rankings and all universities will show you similar rankings that theyre really excellent but something that i really want to emphasize here that im very proud of is that were you know one of the best young universities i remember that we were just established around 11 years ago and uh you know were ranked as number nine among young universities globally were also very good in multi-disciplinary and collaborative research which is you know part of the student experience as well as im going to show the particular subject which is human computer action is also highly ranked ill show you some some data on that later so you can you can be sure when you join aldo you will be uh resting on on state-of-the-art research and activities something thats also really nice uh is that we have a really beautiful campus its its in a bay uh theres a bird reserved area and also forests its really walkable theres still a lively uh center part which is just built around a metro station and a mall which is also quite new development so it is easily reached and its also having all of the services and lots of restaurants and stuff like that and weve been building that uh compost with the idea of increasing sustainability good um i dont know if you know much about finland but finland has been systematically ranked as one of the top countries when it comes to happiness and safety and so social uh welfare and uh you know it is a really safe place to live and theres a lot of nature and you know most finns speak uh english fluently so youll find it easily easy to to get around here especially in helsinki metropolitan area right there even the the mayor was suggesting that we should we should add english as an official language and he wasnt joking so maybe one day well have that lets then talk about the program so theres a bigger program called computer communication and information sciences so thats for short and underneath that umbrella there are many majors and human computer interaction is one of them and human computer action is a multi-disciplinary field that is that is taking contributions from computer science electrical engineering also psychology and social sciences and design and we try to bring all of those elements into our education but nonetheless we have chosen a technical focus and im going to talk about that later so we want to ensure that our students are not you know just getting a generalist education in hci but they have sort of a sharp edge in their teaching that allows them to to land you know very good jobs so ill talk about that um in a minute so why hci if you think about ict as a whole i mean its the driving force in many many ways at the moment and uh nowadays if you think about you know networking and computing resources and all those magnesium magnificent technical capabilities you know they have made almost anything possible and the question is what should we do with this technology and thats where human-centeredness becomes into the picture and and human attraction is uh is a big field within uh computer science and information technology and uh this is a program to to be introduced introduced to that field [Music] i weve been building this program or this major over a few years now and um one design principle has been that we would like to offer a very close contact with research and that basically means that we have you know smaller studio-like courses and also research project courses and we offer a lot of possibilities in terms of doing theses work with the groups and were im going to show a picture gallery all of us there all the professors and um but you see that were quite big uh as when it comes to human conflict interaction and were also very successful when it comes to research and this is starting to be recognized also internationally we have been ranked as number two in europe and number 15 in the world and were the best in in nordic countries if you want to come here and study hci then i think were we have a pretty good offer in terms of uh you know world-class research um and thats also shown in the facilities and laboratories that we we have here in our disposal for example just in the previous period we were teaching a user research and as part of that then the students were taken to our lab to to look at them and work with the eye tracking technology in those labs we have a multitude of other technologies as well you know we have a dedicated labs for vr and ar technology uh then we have you know in our lab we have uh methods and techniques for empirical studies including eye trackers and motion trackers and and whatnot and then there are some other people who do like um fabrication like with 3d printing and so you will find all of those elements here um then i want to talk more about our uh specialization here which is which is you know technical human complete interaction especially applying computational and engineering principles into the design and engineering of interfaces and interactive ai and theres one particular area called creative technologies that thats uh becoming more and more central in everything that we do and i want to show you a small video reel capturing many of these ideas its quite short um but it gives a very nice overview of the kind of work that we do this is called an augmented climbing wall that timeline is these are these are aei generated phases and here you see uh motion synthesis that is based on ai that helps to design better climbing walls heres the animation games that use the body eocdr technologies interaction techniques this is more more games that are physically based or hexagames and theres also uh we have a professor whos working on interactive music technology this is some stuff from our lab we do models of human behavior and use them in computational design also we helped the french nation to adopt a new standard for the keyboards that was designed so this is an this is a real of some of the stuff that that were doing here at old university and we we want to offer our students the possibility of learning those those technologies and just actually to be very concrete tomorrow im going to be teaching about one of those things that that was visible in the videos there was this by this typing video and im going to talk about quality modeling uh in the context of our computational api class um okay a couple of more examples just to give you you know a concrete idea what kind of things you will master after taking this program we use ai methods like deep learning reinforcement and computational simulation to generate a human-like behavior so then they use that as a model to understand and improve tasks and and designs for example now how would you improve uh a techcentric method or intelligent excellent system they need to understand some something about how people move their eyes and make strategic decisions on how to find it we have you you will also learn about computational design which is something that helps designers produce better designs improve the productivity improve their creativity these are actual uh examples of this is an actual example where our student has been involved doing a plug-in for designers that helps designers fix issues with guideline violations in the capital interface designs another student project is here on the right uh weve been working with a smartwatch um producer or manufacturer that was interested in adding a jester recognizer thats actually good for real use or robust enough and then we worked on deep learning-based gesture recognizers and collecting really impressive data set to drain that and help them improve their robustness another slide of examples uh heres the work by berto hama where they they work with rodio to do automated game level testing so in the future uh you youre not necessarily running an expensive and vertical studies but using these ai models of people maybe they are models of gamers in this case to evaluate and design for example game levels so what what happens here is that then you know they gave a game game level to an ai robot or bot but that is then trained to dissolve the game levels and then they get indices of things like well how difficult these levels are or how quickly they would jump out of the game or and do something else and so on what we also do is we work with ai to improve experimentation with human subjects um just actually next week uh you know my pc student is going to teach our students how to do bayesian optimization based experimentation that makes experimentation way more efficient than it ever used to be i already showed that this example in the video review about the keyboards we teach methods that help or can can solve some really hard design problems for example how to uh assign characters or letters onto a keyboard or how to how to do a menu or a web page or or an interaction technique that is optimal for for for your users so were learning also those methods so this is giving a an overview of something you know sharp end of you know what youre going to learn here but its you know by no means limited to what you just saw and let me actually talk about the broader offering that we have um so im im here the professor of interfaces and then we have um a large number of other people who are involved in our our teaching elisa necklace is a professor who came from switzerland and she has a background in psychology and shes interested in studying motivation and experience so basically what keeps a gamer motivated and sustain gaming perks thats one of the questions i already showed some of the work that bert has been doing then we have a new professor who joined from rutgers university in the us i am the lindquist he studies the question that how to make systems that are both usable and secure and thats an interesting area of usable security that is a very timely topic right now and then we also were joined by a new professor of practice anita sony whos looking at human centered design and hes offering for example a very timely course on designing for crises so he was literally looking at you know how can design alleviate some of the issues that we have with covid and hes been holding this uh for two times now the seminar and were also working with uh the alta alta school of arts and there we have our colleagues andres lucero and uh and weve been uh deepening our collaboration with them so we try to offer more possibilities for our students to take their courses but also um their students to take our courses so that they they would mix and mingle a little bit concretely were offering our students the possibility of taking a course on collaborative design which is one of the highlights of our although school of arts research were also organizing a computational design seminar with all the arts in the in the fall and we also have contributions from the ai folks here at helsinki which is a really strong program as well we have something like 16 professors in ai and machine learning and we have to be taking some key courses from their offerings just and made them possible made them available for our students we have professor practice johanna kaipi i think shes known johanna and her topic is healthcare assistance usability and then marconi eminem whos uh in charge of the strategic usability so basically how to um strategically organize and manage activities in companies targeting usability and use experience so that youre going to get a higher level uh perspective to hci from from his courses so this is a gallery of us and of course we also have elixirs here um uh on salovara and nikon and many other ones and and one of the design principles of the whole major has been that we would like to offer a lot of possibilities for you to choose courses this is quite unique i mean many other programs are less that they move like a train and you have no no degree of freedom and uh what we would like to do is that okay well you can propose your own specialization right we make certain courses available and sort of recommend it but you can go wrong that if you wanna lets say that you youre interested in brain computer interfaces okay well lets talk how you can how you can specialize in that one you know maybe you would go to take some of the courses that we have in neurosciences and brain imaging and maybe some of the courses that we have in uh like sensors and measurement in the electrical engineering school and maybe some machine learning [Music] contributions as well and you know by this kind of work then then wed like to help you to to specialize in a way that you you find interesting and you see here a big portfolio of some of the ac aci related topics that we have at alto that uh you know surprisingly can have uh you know even the school of chemical engineering uh they they have for example computational design courses they on you know they dont really do design like we do but they focus for example the design the design of um of materials and uh but nonetheless you know it would teach you some some basics of of computational design in in a methodological perspective that can be applied in many places then we have also a school of business and school of engineering that also have been offering related things like on product design and engineering design but much of the stuff focuses on school of electrical engineering and school of science and there we have three world leading spearhead areas so theres the computational design that i briefly showed interactive machine learnings how to how to learn human in the loop and make systems operate like that and then the other area is is the game design and game that i showed that is represented by elyssa meckler and thats but as you see we also have people offering courses and doing research in the area vr and ar that are very important at the moment and were also building a new uh world-class facility of 25 million euros called alta studios which will be a physical space with lots of different labs that are equipped with um with state-of-the-art uh equipment uh vr and ar so you know this is a portfolio of some of the stuff that we can offer to you when you when you get to the stage of uh picking uh the specializations of course you dont get to do that immediately the the point of the another design principle has been that uh you first learn certain core things so that youre then ready you know to specialize with when youre equipped with the necessary knowledge to do that and some of the the common courses youre going to see here and um as you see here uh theres an important sentence there at top so which is that you know you you can pick a selection of these courses lets say 35 if youre doing the long major or 25 if youre doing the shorter major and you pick among courses like well social media or human factors or user interface technologies or emerging technologies and and um and you know thats going to give you a bit of a control over the direction that you want to take but without compromising um that the core that you need to have in order to specialize later on um this is being updated for next year so were going to have more some changes here for example in terms of security engineering and this co-design course that i mentioned from all the arts and some other changes as well okay and after that then then youre going to have to choose how to specialize and as i said theres this very large buffet of courses that you can take across alt university and you know i just listed some areas that are asia related that have been picked by our students over the years so just to give you some sampling uh we we have some offerings in web technology and if you want to focus on like interactive web then you would pick our courses on like interface construction and web technology and maybe user evaluation and user research and that you know that would form a nice package for you to then have a specialization in web technology similarly we have offerings in the school of electrical engineering on speech recognition technology and natural language processing so pick something from there and combine that with our computational hci cores and you know that allow you then to build interactive systems that operate via speeds or always we have a robotics professor village at elect we have an ar and vr competencies at both ski and elec and related to professors and classes uh and so on and so forth right so you get the sense that um you know theres lots of possibilities to to pick and mix the way where you would like so that how this practically goes is that then at some point youre asked to do your own study plan and that study plan is then reviewed by me or whoever happens to be in charge of the program um and then you get feedback and ideas on how to how to pick the best courses so we want our students to have you know some challenging courses and and also you know thematical orientation that makes them uh recruitable so that they they can end it in the next stage after after getting the degree good um this is an overall structure of the study so theres going to be the common courses that i showed specialization thats part of the major and then theres possibility for elective studies uh you can pick also completely outside of the major itself maybe you do want to do something in like entrepreneurship or all the arts they have some excellent interaction design courses or i dont know graphic design courses and big big some of them and then of course we have masters thesis um which is a big part of of the the study so its about half a year and ill talk more about massage thesis in a minute um so after your your degree there are many opportunities in staying in finland and also during your studies to get contact points with the with the finnish ict industry we have really strong ict games and service industries right here in the capital region we and we work really closely with the industry so we have industry directly funding us and um you know its just maybe a concrete example so so just just yesterday uh porsche the car manufacturer they contacted us and they want to collaborate with us on designing um you know some some new dashboards and you know maybe that then leads to a master thesis position that we can offer to our students um you know similar opportunities are then announced on our internal communication channels where students are invited and you know we post the job uh offerings there we also have lots of uh internet internship positions uh internally and we also encouraged to take internships outside and you know we write letters to our students that then help them design those positions um and we also have very strong uh telecommunications industry that i particularly wanna wanna mention so in addition to the startup community we have ericsson and nokia and theyre always looking for for talent also in human compass direction okay well if youre not interested in industry carrier but you rather want to do a research career uh which i you know strongly recommend considering uh we do have a new system called the doctoral track and hci major is part of that control track um its not something that uh you you you must take in order to become a psc student um that is something that if you have already decided no you know then you can apply for this under theres a special system where you would be doing some research gigs as a resource assistant in in close collaboration with four uh different professors and teams during the track so right now theres one student in the track uh because we just started last year and shes doing the the last um i think shes doing the last um uh gig this this year actually next year and then shes starting the masses north species um you know we were proud that our uh nazi students are also recruited around the world to psd studies you know i i have a very positive experience of our students going to top places in the world uh ethiopia and epfl and university copenhagen they all have our students and we support strongly uh ambitious students who want to go and do their phd even if they dont necessarily do that do do those with us um maybe with that we could turn over to katya who was kind enough to give us our student point of view uh yeah hello everyone my name is katya and currently im doing my second year of studies in the program human computer interaction and to start with my journey without university began even before my studies i was i was a recent assistant for a summer internship in 2019 and to be honest it was a crucial period for my decision where i want to go to my bachelors so i applied for the master for the masters in alta and i was accepted and it was very happy moment for me and currently im finishing my studies to start writing master thesis in the second semester of this year and speaking about my experience i switched to beat my domain of interest for the bachelors i studied social sciences and social informatics but my masters program here is a little bit more technical uh im doing a lot of major in human computer interaction and also i do a minor in data analysis and data science and it really fascinates me how alton university provides you provides opportunities to try different things to learn more about the spheres that really interest you so currently during these two years i tried working with some with some industry cases for example as auntie told about the course on collaborative evaluation there with a bunch of other students we tried to improve side website of the finnish health uh ministry with like regarding the covet stuff and it was a practical case that was really interesting to try but also there were a bunch of academic opportunities like im a research assistant in user interfaces lab and throughout the two years i tried different spheres and i worked with different people there and it is also [Music] really helpful to shape your mind and understand what really what is really interesting for you and what do you want to do after the studies but life in elton university is not only studies we do have a lot of activities for students there is a very strong culture of like student life here and for example myself im living on the campus like we have a lot of dormitories which are very close to all the study buildings and here we can like even like walk a walk around or also we do have a lot of different activities like dance clubs or like theater study student theater theater sports club and so on and so forth so it is always a bunch of opportunities to do something and now when they like go with situation is getting better there are a lot of more and more things you can do around the campus and uh speaking about life of life in finland its really calm and very very safe for like from the students perspective and i can really say that it is a great opportunity to to leave and to study like um so yeah from me it was the mostly positive experience and im really helpful im really happy with the decisions i made a couple years ago so that as im in the place i feel like i should be right now thanks katya and um can you say something about your masters thesis or did you already agree on the topic because thats super cool uh right now i dont have my exact topic yet because i started the position just a couple days ago uh but where was speaking about the design dot ai project which is suppose supposed to help designers in their work were speaking about the plugin for such tools as figma or sketch where a lot of where a lot of technical details requires a lot of attention from the designer but with the help of the plug-in some features can be automized like layouts transformation or changing color palettes so the goal is actually make peoples life easier and i appreciate this so much because its just cool to see the results of your work and yeah this is really great thanks katya i i forgot to mention that i think most of our masters thesis positions are paid so whether you do that in industry or within our groups you get salary for that and normally what students do is that they take either ta so teaching assistant position that is also paid or which has a system position that is also paid and then they follow up with them with the masses this is at some point in a group so if youre looking for you know like sustaining youre living here you know thats nice uh side income for you as well okay um good uh maybe honey i dont know if you want to say something about student life which uh you know i dont have a lot of contact to but but there theres a very strong student union uh we have housing services and support we have a good healthcare system for students and and also i would say excellent facilities for sports because theyre theyre the old olympic facilities that have been developed from the 1954 when the olympics were here in helsinki and you know so we have a big hall uh practically with lots of different facilities for students i dont know honey if you want to add something on this um i think that was quite good but just to remind everyone that we have housing around the campus as as katya already mentioned that shes living living actually there and then we have the sense of community the ayy is a big organization which gathers all the students at aldo so you always find help or uh friends to do something and we try to really take care of you also you know means of health care which is provided for the students so there are links to read more about but we will try to take care of all of our students and so now i just want to add that now that the cove pandemia is over we can also go back to the regular cycle of of celebrations which i i think is uh it is worth mentioning that uh we have the mayday celebration first of may which is a big student event basically so all the students are former students they put on the caps and they go and have fun so and then there will be lots of activities around at that time on the campus related to that okey-dokey um maybe honda do you want to say some words about admission i think its really well explained on the page but if theres something special you want to mention yeah so actually the the this years application series is coming really soon it starts in two weeks it will start on first of december and it will end on third of january so that is the masters application be released this year and we have masters application period always once a year at the end of the year um so theres the link you can see and please check carefully all the application instructions from there theres also information about scholarships and tuition fees that we offer and then all the general admission requirements please remember to check the all the universities general admission requirements and then what this human computer interaction program has itself so that is the info i recommend you to check really carefully when you are apply and we are waiting for your applications thats fun and i i think it makes sense to tell your story in the letter of motivation you know why do you want to study study hci and what drives you and what kind of things you you might build on from the previous education that you want to bring here i think katya is an excellent example of you know bringing something completely different like social sciences here and then doing something interesting with that okay um we are now ready to take your questions and uh maybe you have been keeping track of the questions and can you pick some questions okay i think the first one over here is that will a bachelors degree in age uh hi how do you say the acronym human computer interaction how it will raise my chances to get accepted income in comparison to computer science degrees so which kind of background do you prefer anti um in comparison to to get accepted to to what will a bachelors degree oh yeah you know hci is fine uh we would like to have people who have some computer science because much of our teaching focuses on on or uses computer science lets put it like that so if you have a course on uh minimum you should have something on programming ideally something on like algorithms and you know systems and so on um you know thats going to make your life easier thats not a hard requirement that that would be beneficial to have then theres a question i will not be able to start a master until november 2022 and the master starts in september is this going to be a big problem if i start late um it will be a bit of a problem because many of the orientations and first things that they start in september and then we have the first period you know which is going to be quite packed we for example have the user research course then and many other ones if uh teaching will be organized in hybrid mode or remotely then of course you know maybe you can participate in part of those but i i would recommend uh you know coming in in september meet the other students and myself so im saying that its possible to do it in a way that you propose here so starting in one america youre certainly going to miss something i would say that we our university has a lot of orientation when this study is sought to help you find new friends and get to know everything so in that sense its also valuable to be here but but as undimensionally its its partially possible to start remotely and then hi i am wondering how hci and biasing data analysis can be related in interactive data analysis can you suggest some projects to check out later the bayesian data analysis is working with pretty arcane tools you know building for example on r and stan and things like that and you know theres theres theres a big need to develop a base in that data analysis itself uh to exploit uh interactive uh interaction techniques and uh interactive visualizations and so on and thats something that uh and other ones who are teaching the bayesian data analysis for driving classes of like 400 people that theyre keenly looking at and weve been jointly supervising some some massive students for example on those topics right now they dont have contact so if you if you learn base and data analysis you could learn about the theory and sort of the programming aspects of bayesian data analysis but if you wanted to do something that connects hci you know then it would be up to some sort of interesting research project maybe or and then we also have the danger the info information visualization course where you know some of those things would come together and you would learn some ways of plotting data in interactive and powerful ways so there will be some contact points but uh but not a direct course at the intersection of these things okay well then we already talked a bit about taking part-time jobs so is there a possibility to participate as a research helper or something similar at all to tackle to be rent um i think auntie already mentioned that yes it is possible but uh katya could you tell about your experiences as you told us you have have been working yeah ive been working part-time like during my residence permit im allowed to work 25 hours a week but all my pos but all of my positions were a bit a bit less just to be able to manage my studies and work well um and i worked in a user interfaces lab and i also was a teaching assistant twice for different courses as a research assistant i was uh like i was helping uh people from the lab like with mostly with the things i like to do like information visualization i was doing a lot of graphs to support like research but also it was an excellent opportunity to learn something new like for example i worked with the results of eye tracker studies which i have very little connection to beforehand or also like during the summer during my summer position this year i worked with the uc oakland who is working on like a car model which can simulate a driver and it was a very fascinating topic like i know pretty much nothing about cars but it was so interesting to dive into this field i like to do something once again with my own hands uh there so and there also i know that there are a lot of opportunities to work in different labs and then different like courses and departments so sometimes it works this just you find a person which interests you as a professor and you can write them to ask where the where they are hiring right now so yeah thanks for your experiences um then is there a chance to get involved in hci projects before the master start as jakadarenov mentioned if yes where can i find those so katya where did you find the information and anti do you also have a comment on this well alta has a summer internship for students which i was part of it i think it is yearly company so you can apply some somewhere in the spring if i remember correctly yeah we every year we get the same same questions and there are two things that are happening theres the internship programs by which we we get some some students and get to know them theres the us its called husky as all the school of science uh summer internship program and were part of that so every year we publish some projects and students come already in like a june and they do that they also paid positions by the way and the other thing is that then we have uh aldo hci education teams channel so in microsoft these teams application theres a channel that is dedicated for acs students we publish our job uh positions you know like tara positions there and also some sometimes students just email me that you know do you have anything and then typically or often we have right and i kind of guarantee that everybody gets them but then we do have constant you know look out for our asymptotes thanks then there are two questions by one participant first do you have specific classes about accessibility uh yes and no so unfortunately uh we we did have something on the topic but you know that that person left and the course doesnt exist anymore um but we do cover accessibility related things on undedigated courses so for example in the introduction to hci uh theres something about it and then on my course uh we talk about visual perception models and we touch on accessibility related things like maybe color blindness or water deficiency and stuff like that but its not systematically covered in our force offerings unfortunately we do have a strategic initiative at alton university compost to make our campus more accessible and theres serious effort to do that given that you know im not seeing that so im not not able to sort of um to tell frankly how good it is right so you have to turn to somebody else to get a honest opinion on this yeah that was maybe the second half of the question that how do how does all the create students with disability so inclusion is really important to us and in in terms of our facilities we try to make them as accessible as possible and currently they we are renovating the campus to improve in that sense and i think also our studies now making them remote for example is is a part of that making them accessible but about that how studies are organized maybe auntie do you want to comment that part well i mean theres no shift toward uh hybrid and then physical teaching but some some some courses are still in a remote mode that doesnt mean that thats more accessible by the way so i dont think aldo has yet got as far as like offering uh closed captioning subtitles to lectures and things like that but theres a strategy to improve in that respect and i i think that those people would be very willing to listen to suggestions okay it was theres more specific that uh the person is dyslexic person and has some problems with spelling and reading speed well i mean if you made it as far as getting a bachelor degree in a related area then most likely or okay i dont think theres any anything more than that required then lets find next question the person is a software developer with skillset in machine learning and data science i dont have any hci or design background do i stand any chance to be admitted if i apply yeah uh so this is from uh maria so this is this is a good good question and i i would strongly recommend applying because we we have many students with a similar profile they run you know doing something in machine learning data science computer science software development and then they decided that okay i want to do something more human-centric and how this works in practice is that then we ask you to take some basic courses on we have in the very first period we have introduction to hci you know lets take that course right and start building from that i think its really really healthy that you have a technical core that you can build on because some of the later courses will be technically more involved on the other hand if you have you know design or hci background then you do need to take some of the more technical courses in the beginning so that you prep your way uh to those more challenging masters level courses in nci and i think important over here is to write your motivation on the motivational letter why do you want to change your career for example auntie do you have a comment on this yeah exactly i know we every year we accept people who have no aci background so please dont take that as a requirement it is beneficial if youve taken something but you know believe me we have pretty good offering in the beginning of the semesters to start learning that as well okay then theres a uh question i havent completed my bachelors degree yet if i finish my degree in september while following the lessons is a problem um i think one thing is to check the uh general um admissions instructions aldo has i think i can say that the diploma should be like in the admissions office before you start the classes here but the classes dont start immediately in september so yeah um i think the strict deadlines are available uh you know on our website so you can actually check that from there so our admissions websites will answer to your question uh then um whats the admission rate to hc a uh i cant recall the number im sorry because im actually in charge of the admission and uh and uh we got a i dont know maybe 100 applications and we offer something like 15 maybe that gives you an idea but you know you should not look at the uh acceptance rate per se right because we did all you know all over the world we get applications these days and you should just focus on on making an excellent application yourself um then i couldnt find any hci courses in fitec course its not sure if i missed would really like to get some basics so are we offering feeder courses like uh not not in this major atmosphere yeah i mean if you want to do something like that in your specialization and combine you know hci and feedback you know maybe we can come up with something i have not had a student before who would like to do that and were open enough yeah then i have a background from university of applied sciences are there any special requirements or extra courses needed to take for people not from university background yeah normally we would recommend some more uh technical computer science course for example we have excellent course courses by uh lucas and their customers are teaching the the basics of computer science and not just programming but computer science as a science and those would be quite quite recommended because you get certain basic concepts there uh in terms of like how algorithms work and so on that you can then apply in that that is somewhat required you know when you for example apply optimization or machine learning um in the way that were doing in these courses but you know its um you know we have had students from you know university of life sciences uh and then we then direct them to take some courses like that okay i think we have time for a couple of more questions anything you wish to ask from katya who is our student or something else we still have few minutes left and thank you so far for that really good questions oh maria has a question um yeah the feeder is is open university and um are there any open university courses on on the topic on the topic of fittech i dont know on the topic of hci i also dont know uh vtec is the organization but um i think they they might be a bit more general the course is over there and not as special as hei yeah yeah i i dont really know that and then uh question uh what can you tell us about the joint program with eit digital for human computer interaction yeah i can i can tell a lot about that because im in charge of the exit year on that program so it consists of two years one in one site in europe thats part of the chain of universities like in paris or stockholm and the other one here and im in charge of the the specialization on computational uh hci so you know very much similar things that i just showed uh typically you know you would start in in september take a course in user research and computational design and then starting in january you would do a masters thesis here in helsinki with the company typically but sometimes with academic groups as well we have some really good experiences with ert students they also you know its quite intense because you have to go to two sites but then again you know get uh pretty uh good networking uh out of that and you get uh quite diverse experiences and typically they land uh good job positions and some of them go to do with expositions as well so i recommend also considering that one its a good program if you are interested in the double degree which the eit is uh kindly check the admissions period then or the application period because its a bit different than this one we are talking at the moment so please please be specific on that um i think one more question we still have time so thanks so far about the questions and anything else and i i also want to welcome if you have any questions just email me or on uh were happy to help yeah and and you can also send questions to admissions at all the dot fi so if you have anything about the how to apply so they also help you with the technical side of applying to our university but if no further questions so thank you so much for participating and good luck with applying and we hope to see you here in the canvas next fall indeed well see you soon and thank you for joining this session and have a nice rest of the week thank you
