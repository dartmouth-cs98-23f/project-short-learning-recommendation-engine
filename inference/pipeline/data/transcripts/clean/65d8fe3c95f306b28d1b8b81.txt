that every application that we use today has something called the front end which is the user interface and the back end which is the software that accesses data for us and finally we have the database to store the data now these three together form something called as the full stack so hi guys welcome to this video on what is full stack by simply learn but before we begin if you havent subscribed to our channel already make sure to hit the subscribe button and the bell icon to never miss an update so heres whats in store for you first well have a look at what front-end development is then well see some of the front-end languages then well move on to some front-end libraries and frameworks then well see what back-end development is understand some of the popularly used back-end languages and frameworks and finally well have a look at the database so now what exactly is front-end every time you open a website it has several ui components and once you click on a particular icon say sign in in this case you get navigated to the sign in or the login page right so what happens is that all of these items facilitate navigation and utility these are collectively called as the front end so the front end is the visible part of the website or the web application which is responsible for user experience the user directly interacts with the front-end portion of the website or the web application so now lets have a look at some of the front-end languages so im sure youve heard of html css and javascript so these are collectively called the frontend languages when it comes to html it defines the structure of websites and formats the web pages it also defines text documentation so lets look at a simple example so here ive made use of the h1 tag which is the heading tag in html and ive displayed the message hello welcome so correspondingly my website displays the same message so html is responsible or it defines what is being shown on the website next up is css now css is a style sheet that allows you to alter and style different web components beat size font spacing etc it makes the content on the website look more decorative correct so now if you have a look at the code here ive added some styling ive changed the font style to italic ive made the text bold and ive changed the color to red and again correspondingly all the changes are seen on the website moving on we have javascript now javascript is a very powerful client-side scripting language and it is mainly used for enhancing the interaction of a user with the web page so again if you have a look at the code here i have created a form wherein the user can enter their name and ive also displayed the message please enter your name as a result an input box is made available where the user can type in their name now this is facilitated by javascript so as i mentioned earlier it is used to make web pages interactive and bring the web applications to life so next lets have a look at some front-end frameworks and libraries now most of these are javascript frameworks and libraries first we have react then theres angular theres view theres jquery and then theres bootstrap now all of these help develop the front end of the application however when it comes to react angular in view its not necessary that you must know everything to create a website one of them will be sufficient however the usage of react is on the rise and most of the developers prefer using react jquery and bootstrap are also powerful frameworks that can be used to create interactive web pages now that you know what front-end development is you must be wondering how the data is being fetched and how this data is being presented in front of you on your screen correct now this is all facilitated by the back end of the application so lets understand what back-end development is now back-end basically refers to the server-side development of the application it is responsible for managing all the database with the help of queries and apis so every time the user makes a request it queries the database and retrieves the data from the database and presents it to the user and lastly it ensures data consistency so now lets have a look at some backend languages and frameworks firstly we have node node and express.js are packages provided by javascript then theres python which is a very popularly used language python frameworks like django and flask are popularly used to create the backend of applications then theres java and java provides spring and java server faces which are also used for back-end development then theres c-sharp which provides frameworks like asp.net core and asp.net mvc and other popularly used backend languages are php theres perl and ruby database is the collection of interrelated data which helps an efficient retrieval insertion and deletion of data from database and organizes the data in the form of tables views schemas reports now some of the commonly used database management systems are mysql theres postgresql theres microsoft sql server theres oracle database and then theres mongodb but how can we at simply learn help you if you wish to make a career as a full stack developer then a certification will come in handy for that you could head to our official website and look for full stack development courses now we offer the full stack

booking flight tickets to making important bank transactions these apps have made our lives easier to cope with the changing demands with respect to user experience and security web development needs to take a robust and efficient approach this video tells you what the future of web development will look like so lets begin by understanding what web development is a web development involves building and maintaining website and other web applications a web developer is expected to convert a web design into a website theyre responsible for how a website or web application looks and functions from its user interface and page layout to back-end systems for gathering data so a lot goes into building a website there are several tools frameworks and packages that help create web applications html css javascript are the basic languages required to develop a website javascript offers several frameworks and libraries like react angular and view javascript and its environment like node.js and express js node is an open source clock cross platform runtime environment that allows developers to create server-side tools and javascript applications knowledge of the basic command line like npm node package manager is essential but im sure youre aware of all this so whats going to be new well according to experts there are four major future trends in web development so lets start and decode them one by one first up is typescript typescript is a superset of javascript and is an object oriented programming language in simple terms it is just javascript with other impressive additional features typescript supports all javascript libraries and frameworks with an increase in code complexity javascript had to fulfill the requirements of oop hence that lead to the introduction of typestrip typescript helps with quicker code development thus improving performance there are a few improvements with typestrip that give it an upper hand over javascript only at the time of development does typescript bring out compilation issues this reduces the chances of mistakes occurring at runtime a property of typescript is that it is strongly typed or enables static typing static typing allows type correctness to be checked at compilation time in javascript this isnt possible typescript is nothing but javascript and some additional features ie es6 features some of these features are interfaces generics namespaces null checking and access modifiers typescript supports intellisense which provides active hints as the code is added so considering all these advantages typescript is something that will be widely adopted by teams across the globe next up is webassembly webassembly is a new way to run on the web webassembly or wasm is the second universal programming language that all web browsers can understand and run however youre not going to be writing scripts in web assembly yourself its a low level assembly language designed to be very close to compile machine code and very close to native performance what this means is practice is that javascript is no longer the only language you can run on the web web browsers can run any language now if that language has a web assembly compiler even traditional desktop languages like c plus plus and rust can be compiled down to wasm with relative ease wasm currently runs in 94 of users browsers with ie uc browser and oprah mini support being the main things holding it back as per usual however its backed by developers from mozilla microsoft google and apple and support in modern browsers is fast moving next up we have package managers packages a package manager or package management system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing upgrading configuring and removing software packages for a computers operating system in a consistent manner it typically maintains a database of software dependencies and version information to prevent software mismatches and missing prerequisites npm is the package manager for the node javascript platform it puts modules in place so that node can find them and manages dependency conflicts intelligently it is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases yarn is another package manager that replaces the existing workflow for the npm client or other package managers while remaining compatible with the npm registry it has the same feature said as exciting workflows while operating faster more securely and more reliably lastly we have javascript dialects compiler to javascript there are many javascript dialects like coffeescript darn babel typescript and sweaty that offers better features that javascript and ultimately compile to javascript it is likely that these languages will be the future there are several other predictions like better appreciation for web standard less client works and more focus on personal projects and the need to know more languages regardless the future of web development looks more promising than ever if you wish to make a career as a web developer start now so where do you think the future of web development is headed let us know in the comments below
