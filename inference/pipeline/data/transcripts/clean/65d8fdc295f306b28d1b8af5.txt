the human-computer interaction study program Italian University and together here is also my colleague Sonya who will do the introduction for interaction design and also Andreas so both of them are managing the interaction design masters program and also our students gabriela Inchon who will give you a little brief personal introduction about their study experience ok so Ill try to share my screen now and well go through the through the presentation so I hope everything works nicely Ill try to go fullscreen so that everyone can see ok so I hope that you can see the slides if not please let me know but I really hope everything is working and briefly to introduce the HCI study program to you so in the human-computer interaction study program will emphasize technology for the benefit of people thats our kind of tagline thats our model and thats thats how we try to also approach things on a day to day basis and what are we about we focus on three main things our masters program is very much research driven its informed by our latest state-of-the-art research that we do within our group and thats thats why I also most of our teachings most of the also the lectures most of the classes that were organized most of the material that we share with our students is not from the book its from our ongoing state-of-the-art research thats something you cannot kind of go to a library and read about thats something that we share with you on our fresh experience we focus on new and emerging technology so wed like to think of ourselves as working on things that will only become commercially available or mainstream in five to ten years so thats also kind of of the our focus areas thats what we have tried to do to play with technologies that will only go mainstream in the future and were also very much theory based and reflective which again I guess feeds back to this research driven approach so most of the discourse that we have in the various sessions in the various modules is based on theory we want to engage in hands-on activities in the design process wed like to be very much reflective and critical about what we do and how we put together and what values we use so I think it kind of these three things these three facets permit very much what we do in the program if we look into the background of the students that you might eventually encounter in the program then its a very diverse because the the field of HCI is also very diverse so I try to point out four main areas of where people come from to study with us its mainly computer science design psychology and anthropology but theyre also kind of surrounding disciplines such as economics and human factors sociology language semiotics engineering so its a very mixed crowd of people some with more engineering or more technical background some more the more artistically design-based background some from social behavior scientists so different understandings different schools of thought different approaches to design research and technical foundation and we put all of you on all of them together to make cool stuff happen lets see oops sorry so how our our studies organize how would they go about approaching things well we go through several stages of theory or several different types of activities from emphasizing and researching to defining the problem statement through constraints and guidelines and then ideation and brainstorming and then modeling and prototyping testing and evaluating finally publishing and producing so in the course of the study she would cover the whole range from from contextual acquiring and background research to creating or defining the design challenge or the problem statement and finding solutions exploring alternatives how to implement things and then evaluating with users assessing and finally producing the final outcome the course overall the program is is a two-year program four semesters and this is how its mainly structured in the main category so if some of you have already looked into the more formal program description then you might see that we start with university-wide courses which is like confrontation and the course that we have there is them is the mmm interdisciplinary course that we run throughout the university so all you can interact with people from all sorts of backgrounds and programs from out the university and then theres a set of harmonization courses so depending on which background you come from either design or technical background or maybe social behavioral sciences we will look into what skills youre missing either design or programming development or both and then you get the chance to get those skills and also theres an intensive foundations section which teaches you a lot about the theoretical landscape of HCI the different research methods that we use and how to go putting together your initial research proposal for your masterpiece then theres a set of core courses and then to selection modules either on shaping experiences or in shaping Society depending on which way you want to go either focusing or the micro or the macro level of designing interactions and then theres training either through internship or training abroad and a set of electives that where you can choose from a set of different courses that we offer to kind of create your own a unique profile and path and then finally we wrap off the course with a master thesis project which is kind of project you work on on a selected topic with your supervisor to build very nuanced and detailed expertise on a certain area that of your interest so on the next slide assignment it opens you will see the breakdown of the different courses throughout throughout the semesters so like I mentioned the program is a four semester long two year course in the first semester we start with this harmonization or we call them up to kind of getting your skills up to date basically courses then theres a set of foundational courses which lasts for the first year core courses are the core courses to the HCI curriculum mainly focusing on kind of the foundations of HCI and also this shaping experiences shaping Society module which is kind of you can choose which path you want to go through in the second semester II also take this university-wide courses then the third semester is what we call our mobility window so its either you take a set of selectives or you actually can choose to go abroad on an Erasmus exchange to study in a different University in a different country and the fourth semester is actually devoted to the masterpiece so this is roughly how you your studies could pan out over the four semesters and you can see here a more detailed view of how these courses are organized similar to what I was showing to you before so the Foundations organization shaping experiences anxiety electives that you can take in the first semester in the second semester will mainly focus on an integrated project which is a very hands-on activity which where you go exactly through this process of coming up with a design challenge or researching the background and then finishing off with a working prototype that has been thoroughly tested with users finally in the first semester you go for this kind of studies abroad or internship in a company free electives and then you finish up with the master thesis okay so to tell you more about the mast it is because thats again related to this research driven part of our studies we try to go for either applied or basic research so you can do a hands-on project developing or designing something or you can actually go for basic research and go maybe in more to theory building and creating different models we usually go for a dual supervision model because we try to go for thesis topics that are very much multidisciplinary so bringing in or combining several different areas of expertise and we frame them within our current research things which are for I wont go through too much detail on that we have these topics also posted on our website but we work across four main areas design theory and methodology user experience neurophysiology and body centric computing so some of these are overlapping and complementary and depending on where your heart lies closer to the most you can choose and position yourself within one of these topics and what you can see here on the slide are some subtopics that kind of try to illustrate what this work within one of these larger areas could be about so all of our students eventually need to position themselves and their mass that is within this within these four topics or with within one of these four topics okay so we also have a very nice infrastructure to support our activities we have in our school in our Institute we have five labs but were mainly using the first three ones most of our activities are based on the interaction design lab where we go into kind of this we have a space an open space which facilitates all of these different conceptualization and from the Taiping activities and then theres a companion smaller lab to it where we run controlled lab experience using different equipment that Ill show you in a moment and then we also use the harbor lab where we mainly go into body centric and yeah own own body computing we also have the software lab and game lab which also some where students use but may need these three ones um that I kind of highlighted here okay so some of the tools that we use we go from paper-based to very hands-on microcontroller and electronics materials we go and explore different types of devices and different types of modalities from wearables to virtual reality to touchscreens to motion sensors and game based interactions to physiological computing such as eye tracking emotions emotional state tracking to finally tapping into your brain and actually looking into how your brain reacts to certain things react to stimuli reacts to interactions that are being kind of designed and also how you in can interact with the system through your brain so kind of this goes both ways so as you can see a whole range of different materials and devices and equipment that we use all of this is available in the labs that I mentioned to you before and finally we also have different kind of testers or flavors of our arm of the courses that we teach in the program in different formats one of them the most maybe the oldest and one of the more mature one is the experimental interaction design course where we actually go into a two intensive process of conceptualizing designing and prototyping Bodhi centric interactions and pieces just some examples with students coming with necessary no design or development background and in two weeks building working prototypes with Arduinos and microcontrollers so this is just a glimpse of what we do in just two weeks you can read more about it either on the summer school or winters covariant because were on this course twice a year we also run the annual world visibility the event which I think the last edition it happened took place on November 22 in the town and critic hub and its it brought together on 500 people from the Baltics and maybe in countries such as Finland Russia Sweden people come from all the region to join for this one they full event of of conferences and presentations and also an accompanying two or three days of hands-on workshops so this is kind of an also very big event that were hosting every year and you can read more about this here on the website would Dottie world usability day dont eat and I think thats it thats what briefly I wanted to tell you about the program Im exactly 15 minutes so Im on time and Ill hand it over to Sonya Andreas okay Thank You Leah and I would like to welcome everyone to this information session first and I will be introducing you the interaction design can you just tell me when to switch so basically this muscle is offered since 2016 its a hundred percent online study program its run in English its a joint problem so its run in cooperation between two universities Tala universities where Im the head of the program and Cyprus University of Technology where andreas pathologies the head the program so we we have two heads thank you for this program the game of the master basically similar to the HCI master stood educate and train students who have a strong interest interest in the interaction design also we emphasize technology from the benefit of people so in terms of position can you switch position this this master it has it has been created from from an existing program that is human-computer interaction and it overlaps also with this problem some of the the courses and also some other courses are together from South Wales University of Technology and that experience in this in this problem so you can see here that it kind of overlaps in this in this sense Tallinn University and psychedelic University and gains from this both universities experiences but the next one please so in terms of her fields and our areas we we prime the computer science the business and the design area so all of this overlapped a little bit here about the program so in the its the same as the HCI program so four semesters to two years course in the first semester fall semester that runs from September until December we have a set of foundation courses core complementary courses and practice and specialization the all of them are compulsory so foundation courses are like courses like design Theory methodology research methods foundations of human-computer interaction the cold horses are like courses like interaction design methods complementaries prototype and practice and specialization is individual subjects where we invite students to select a set of individual subjects to study that they would like to complement in that problem the next during spring from January to June we also have some set of core courses complementary courses and practice and specialization so the core courses here are development of interactive systems user experience evaluation fuel research methods in HCI the complementary are current topics in human interaction in human-computer interaction Universal Design the practice is its basically a practice course where you invited to do practice about the interaction design thank you on semester three and semester for second year so fall and spring we have a set of core courses - and the foundation courses so in semester three so the course is the interaction design project where you put in practice everything that you learn on the first first year and the foundation course is your master to the seminar where you are helped to set up the main research problem and to guide you to - to who - throughout the second the second the semester for that is the master thesis notes so this is more or less what what it is the distribution of courses throughout the fall semester so we are poor horses master disease foundation courses and practice and specialization courses mood of the liver so everything is online we use mainly Google tools Google Apps and Google classroom we have a combination of and synchronous communication its mainly synchronous we have a couple of synchronous communication at least one or two per course but it depends on the course content and the mode of the lecture the deliver of the assignments and and the projects are bi-weekly so you will set you will have a set of assignments every two weeks the assessed test is a assessment is based highly and in the assignments and project work at the end of the semester we invited you to present verbally in the synchronous session and exam neutral the the course we are starting this this program in September 2020 so as I was saying throughout the years of experiences offering this course both face-to-face and online we we believe that we need to limit the number of students so this this online course has a small number of students because we want to mentor in a mentoring students one maybe and want one advising we also want to make it flexible because the main target of students are the ones that are working students so thats why we offered the course to be then to be run as part-time or full-time if you are if you do it a part-time you will do to more or less an average of three courses per semester if you know what this whole time youll do six courses per semester regarding the lectures and students so these are the set of lectures for Tallinn University Ilya sonja and david llamas and elections from the cycles University of Technology andreas Alexandras and Panna cottas of course we have additional extra support but these are the main lecture regarding the students we have a unique and multinational set of students so we have three students joining us from 36 different countries and you can see the set of countries here the total of students that we have right now its 98 and by the end of this year we expect wealth 21 students finishing the program so if you want to know more about it you are some testimonials here that you can go and read about it but Shawn will will also be here to kind of present her his view of the problem hes finishing this semester so he has a lot of things to say to you yeah okay so thats it from my side thank you thank you so much for you so now we first invite capella to maybe share some of your experiences Gabrielle is from Brazil originally but now living in Estonia for almost one year and studying with us in the HCI masters program so maybe completely can say a couple of words think I need to hello can you hear me yep loud and clear yeah so thank you for the introduction in it so yeah Im Ella Im originally from Brazil Im a something that at first that was I thought I would not really fit in the human-computer interaction program because Im from the from Committee I have a background in communications but yeah as either explained its a very interdisciplinary course its been really a very nice experience so far we have a very mixed group so the same way that Im Im from communication I have people from psychology people from computer science and design order yeah order other backgrounds and its really good because we can really discuss from different perspectives how how to move on with technology so I think one of the the first things that he mentioned that we the goal of the program is to create technology for the benefit of people I think that thats really thats really what we discuss here we have a lot of critical we develop a lot of critical thinking on on the topic and also have the chance to have some hands-on experiences so now Im Im finishing the first year so we are actually still engaged in this integrated project and its been a lot of work really in in developing something so unfortunately we couldnt use all the resources that we have in the lab that he also presented we had the chance to use some in the previous semester but we managed to do everything online but its nice you know like everything is really there we can really use and I think one of the things that I would like to highlight is that all the teachers from from the beginning of the program the program theyre very open to discussions and to to really hear and what people have to say and helping you out to develop the ideas that you have so yeah I think I think its a good way or its a very good program regardless or for different objectives so Im really more into this conceptual Im interested in this conceptual area of how to how to make better technology so I think thats thats really interesting for me but I see that also people who are more into developing and creating they also have been learning and growing a lot in their practice and of course I also managed to develop my skills on that considerably so yeah I think thats thats what they can say so far also overall about University its been I mean its not very big University I think its a good size so we have enough space we have this art this lab that we can use its very very helpful its a place where we can actually make contact with the teachers with other students from other ears so its its very good for the development of our skills okay thank you so much Gabriela so now maybe Shawn can share some of these experiences into online masters please okay hi Mary one for Singapore so I come from a background in art and computer science slam a door or a designer developer so I guess what made me want to do the program is it would be nice to have a formal grounding in designing for computer things so thats why I did it I guess most of you guys will be will be like me working professional so after a while design principles everything they get they become intuitive so the whole way the course was delivered I mean you get it every two weeks you have an assignment and its more or less practical so if it works for me it is not it is stressing me out phonetically that much because Im not so good [Music] timewise he was great as well because Im in Singapore and they are over in Estonia so the really deliver a synchronously thats good for me so why do is I finished what then I do my assignments then we return in and then we get back and then at the end of everything you do the presentation again module went on we know what else can I see over all the lectures are great they know what theyre doing really so yes and as they yeah maybe maybe you could mention just briefly your experience with working with colleagues from all over the world so yeah that is good to be honest a lot of the people youll be working with a really experienced so we had we had Joe who was idea UX I keep telling them was like sanguine I was above me so its just really inspiring inspiring to see what we are Im Wanda was only senior management and his is overall quite a good experience I would say yeah its great its great I like you thank you so much John so maybe some some of our participants will have questions for you later on so be ready to answer those yes what is your reason for studying and what do you want to achieve with this yes Arielles muted so well I didnt mention before that Im from communications but I used to work with advertising so my initial motivation it was actually to try to move to the UX field - I sort of in Brazil its not such a formal field and I wanted to get some formal education that would actually put me closer to that so that was my initial goal thats why I started but now Im really interested in Im getting more involved into this more theoretical research side of human-computer interaction so now Im considering maybe trying to focus more on research and maybe following a bit further in city academic life so Im not sure yet but I feel like I I get Im getting enough skills to to follow both paths if I decide later so Shawn has already touched upon this although in the format of the online studies and the face-to-face studies are similar so its bi-weekly courses we need every Wednesday Thursday and Friday so you need to plan for full days from morning till evening its roughly I guess six hours of classes six to eight hours depending how intensive that they will be and then you have two weeks in between to work on your assignments either individually or in group the labs as Gabriela mentioned are open to students 24/7 so usually you can apply for a student pass and then you can go and work in the lab so whenever you want to if you prefer early morning or late at night or on the weekends its totally up to you so its its whenever the university is open its almost open all the time throughout the year I think you are welcome to come at your own time at your own schedule and and work here you also wanted to entertain your online course usually we set the deadline on Tuesdays so you have the weekend to also to work on your assignments so you expect to deliver something something in the end of the day of Tuesdays okay so finally someone asks the question we have been open waiting for what about Kovac and what do we do about studies in in autumn so the answer is that we dont have an official answer yet were actually waiting for that from the studies department but of course when Ive been talking about it for the online masters is not a problem because its all online for the face-to-face masters I think and this is kind of not the official statement yet but thats something that were planning to do at the moment is to go with blended model studies so those who are able to come here to Estonia for the beginning of the school year are more than welcome to come hopefully the health situation we will be allowing us to to actually meet face to face is there kind of in vacations of that and those of you who for different reasons wont be able to come by September will be able to join online in our session so we will have kind of a parallel schedule of online sessions to complement our face-to-face study so maybe and kind of doing group work presentations youll be joining in online together with our face-to-face students and and contributing and participating in that I guess like you saw from the presentation of the online masters we have extensive experience of teaching both face-to-face and online so it shouldnt be much of an issue of going with this blended mode of studies its similar to the hei so its a much disciplinary program its not we dont demand so high its so high developing and programming skills so our level of programming on online master is lower than the other face-to-face but the skills are multidisciplinary so you can can come from different fields and you will work together and youll shed experience regarding this yeah I hope that I managed to answer my question yeah maybe I can just comment on that as well because the the development course was I was teaching it before so what were planning for the new additions to actually have a full support for you to get you started started with kind of basics of developments and to teach you how to actually put stuff together so well walk you through the process that will be materials there will be full support so that by the end of the day you can actually make stuff happen even if you dont have the technical skills so I think it should be quite nice of course we expect some technical skills were doing with with all necessary tools for for learning online by computer using the internet but this is the basic ones yeah yeah true okay so emma is asking about the programming skills for HCI masters again Sonya already touched on it the the background of students degree mixed its very multidisciplinary and thats why we also offer this harmonization courses mmm the harmonization course for programming skills is called end-user computing and it fits nicely it starts in the per semester and fits nicely into the development of interactive systems in the second semester so you go from the full range of kind of really basics of programming to putting more complex stuff together like Android applications eventually also getting introduced to to Arduino and microcontroller so youll get the full support so the only thing that we ask from you is kind of motivation and interest to get started with this even if you dont have the background being open and being willing to learn new stuff and then well kind of walk you through the whole process so its its mainly of of we have a little in Italian University we have a bit more credit so we will run its a program that its 51% from Tallinn University and 50% from Cyprus university of technology so its 1% more from Tallinn University so well so far Ive been I chose to dedicate only to studies now but several of our class of my classmates are already working or already found something so there are several several startups and companies in in Estonian I havent really researched much in the other Baltic countries but I I believe that its quite similar I think overall in this HCI field either four more to the side of programming and computer science and also for the side of design theres quite a good demand I would say theres theres people needed likes cute people needed in this regard so its I seek good opportunities there there are possibilities to work there also even within the university sometimes we get contacted about opportunities for for work or for projects so yeah overall I would say there its promising field here yeah and its also a challenge for us teaching stuff because our students I go start working either by then the first semester by the end of the first year and then we need to chase them so its a challenge were kind of happy that they can find a job but also not happy when they get distracted with the job and not focusing on their studies so thats kind of its its its kind of two sides to the coin so but I would say in general there are good opportunities in Estonia maybe not immediately in the first semester but as you start getting some hands-on skills then experience shows that by the end of the first academic year most of the students can get a job maybe on a slightly lower level initially but then gradually progressing to higher levels to eventually some of our aluminized having very nice positions are in the in the IT IT sector in Estonia so most of them arent and working its and then its like a Braille I said its your decision whether you want to kind of not work deliberately because you want to focus in your studies or you want to combine some house orders I think there are good opportunities eventually we are two types a to two types of Admissions we have a documentation admissions where we go throughout all the documents that you submit and we assess you in base of the documents and then we do an intervention an interview admission so this is the test that maybe we are talking about Ilya this isnt it from hgi point of view yeah so theres a process that you need to submit its its your CV motivation letter and portfolio and then we in the admissions interview we spent half an hour pre each candidate actually meeting you online synchronously and then we kind of go over your interests we ask you about eventually the the topic that you would like to work on for your master thesis your skillset some projects that you have worked on in the past and yeah we try to assess kind of your plans and your motivations for the future so thats thats basically what the admissions is all about well for designers we really go very deep into the methodology and theory of design the different theoretical frameworks how to systematically approach the design process and of course also the technical side of things so if youre lacking the technical skills then we would first expect you to invest more into learning the basics of programming how to put stuff together so that eventually this integrated project that Gabriela mentioned that shes now working on with our colleagues in the second semester in Spain you would be ready to actually actively contribute to building stuff so thats thats kind of the learning curve that you as designers would go through what I did was I was studying full-time and I took the program full time as well so it definitely can be done but I think what most of the other students did is they took three modules and then they they worked at the same time so its really up to you to judge how much know you can handle I guess but it can be done I did full time work and I did full time studies hope that answers a question we also advise students to to try and see how much courses they can handle they can start with three enrolling three courses and then if they feel that they can handle a little bit more than then the next semester they can enroll in four or six it depends on them the same the other way also works so if you feel that you cannot manage the workload and now you cannot let us know and you can reduce the amount of courses that we enrolled in the and the next semesters the courses are mainly fall semester are based in HCI although in some cases we have intensive courses for lasting for one or two weeks but these are mainly exceptions normally the courses last for 14 weeks thats the length of the semester but which means that we will have an average of seven to eight contact sessions so one session every two weeks so this is the average schedule for the courses to clarify as well that for the online mastery any interaction design you dont need to submit a portfolio you can but its not obligatory so for those who would like for the online master they need to submit their their CV just to clarify yeah for the h-hi for the face face you need to submit the city the motivation later and the portfolio so three things thats thats the main difference if you have any more questions to follow-up please send them over this link that made it is shared with you till till you dot e / n / en / as an English / ask thank you for coming yes thank you all for being available and hope to see you soon one of these days
