welcome to our second topic in the subject introduction to human computer interaction or xci which deals particularly in computer graphics as we have discussed before that the field of hci covers a wide range of topics and its development has relied on contributions from many disciplines some of the main disciplines which have contributed to hci is computer science and its been using xci principles in the development of its technology software design development and maintenance user interface management and user interface development environments its prototyping tools and lastly computer graphics and for this session we will mainly discuss about computer graphics the goal of this lecture is to introduce to you the basic concept or fundamentals of computer graphics that you could use as your foundation in understanding computer graphics in general and be able to use it during its implementation to begin with let us define what is a computer graphics computer graphics is the use of computers to create and manipulate pictures on a display device it comprises of software techniques to create store modify or represent pictures it is also the manipulation and representation of the image or the data in a graphical manner so let us now proceed with the types of computer graphics there are two types of computer graphics one is what we call the raster graphics and the other one is the vector graphics in the raster graphics pixels are used for an image to be drawn it is also known as a bitmap image in which the sequence of image is into smaller pixels basically a bitmap indicates a large number of pixels together while in the vector graphics mathematical formula are used to draw different types of shapes lines objects and so on so these are as you can see the two types of graphics the vector and the raster well the raster graphics are most of the time its uh file extensions are ai or the adobe illustrator eps or the encapsulated postscript cgm a computer graphics meta file pdf or the portable document format and sbgs scalable vector graphics and cdr of the coreldraw files corridor is one of the main applications in graphic editing on the raster side we have much of the file extensions being generated by the raster type of graphics are the following emp the bitmap image file the tiff or image file format the pcx or picture exchange format gif is very familiar to us graphic interchange format and the png the portable graphics format and the last one is the jpeg or what we interpret as the join photographic experts group sorry thousands now discuss what is the main task of computer graphics or the purpose being served by a computer graphics so open graphics it is responsible for displaying art and image data effectively and meaningfully the consumer another one is also used for processing image data received from the physical world such as photo and video content the importance of computer graphics computer graphics uh contribute a crucial function in the world of computing as they furnish a means to encompass a visual element to diverse categories of computer applications computer users witnessed them in a multitude of applications including desktop programs web applications and mobile applications and there are experience in virtually all domains ranging from business to engineering to gaming let us now proceed with the various uses of a computer graphics some of the applications of computer graphics are computer art using a computer graphics we can create fine and commercial art which include animation packages paint packages these packages provide facilities for designing object shapes and specifying object motion curtain drawing paintings logo design can also be done so if you are an artistic person you could also express your creativity in using computer graphics in doing the computer art other application is the computer-aided drawing designing of buildings automobile aircraft is done with the help of computer aided drawing this helps in providing minor details to the drawing and producing more accurate and sharp drawings with better specifications so the most or the commonly used application including this application is the autocad if youre familiar with thats a computer-aided drawing [Music] other type of the other type or applications of computer graphics is the presentation graphics so for the preparation of reports or summarizing the financial statistical mathematical scientific economic data for research reports managerial reports moreover creation of bar graphs pie charts time chart can be done using the tools present in computer graphics so computer governance can also be used in the field of entertainment computer graphics find a major part of its utility in the movie industry and game industry used for creating motion pictures like disney pixar music video television shows cartoon animation films while in the game industry for focus and impact and interactivity are the key players computer graphics helps in providing such features in the efficient way so as you can see you can also use a computer graphics in creation of the motion pictures as well as indication of games computer games the other application is in the field of education computer generated models are extremely useful for teaching huge number of concepts and fundamentals in an easy to understand and learn more using computer graphics many educational models can be created through which more interest can be generated among the students regarding the service or even also using computer graphics in the provocation of education to the young generation or to the professionals so another usage is in the field of training specialized system for training like simulators can be used for training the candidates in a way that can be crushed in a short span of time with better understanding training modules using computer graphics is simple and very useful so another usage is in the field of visualization today the need of visualized things have increased drastically the need of visualization can be seen in many advanced technologies data visualization helps in finding inside the data to check and study the behavioral processes around us we need appropriate visualization which can be achieved through proper usage of computer progress so another message is in the field of image processing but these kinds of photographs or images require editing in order to be used in different places processing of existing image or images into refined ones forwarder for better interpretation is one of the main applications of computer graphics so the most commonly used apps in image processing is like the adobe photoshop another usage is in the machine drawing so computer graphic is very frequently used for designing modifying and creation of various parts of machine and the whole machine itself the main reason behind using computer graphics for this purpose is the precision and clarity we get from such drawing is ultimate and extremely desired for the same manufacturing of machine using destroying and the other one is the application about computer graphics in terms of graphical user interface so the use of pictures images icons pop-up menus graphical objects helps in creating a user-friendly environment where working is easy and present using computer graphics we can create such an atmosphere where everything can be automated and anyone can get that desired action performed in an easy fashion so as you can see that the mobile applications the gui or the graphical user interface and you could see the application of computer graphics including those menus on our cell phones computers operating systems so thats all the possible or as of this moment the usage or the uses of graphics computer graphics so in the near future we dont know that this piece of usage would be could be used for or it can add another application or another usage for the equipment practice so let us now proceed with the common terminologies in computer graphics one of the common terminologies that you encounter is called the image processing it is a method to convert an image into digital form and perform some operations on it in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it the other one is pixel it is a pixel or picture element in short is the smallest item of information and image pixels are arranged in a two-dimensional grid represented using squares each pixel is a sample of an original image where more samples typically provide more accurate representations of the original [Music] the other one is the resolution resolution is the number of horizontal and vertical pixels on a display screen the more pixels the more information is visible without scrolling screen resolutions have a pixel count such as [Music] hundred times one two hundred which means one thousand six hundred horizontal pixels and one thousand two hundred vertical pixels the next is the aspect ratio it describes the width and height of a screen or image an aspect ratio consists of two numbers separated by a color the first number denoting the image is width and the second its height for example an aspect ratio of 1.3 degrees to 1 means the image will be 1.33 times the size of its height the next one is called rasterization it is the task of taking an image described in a vector graphics format or shapes and converting it into a raster image a series of pixels dots or lines which when displayed together create the image which was presented or represented by sheets rasterizing a layer will convert any type of vector layer into pixels as the vector layer the image is made up of geometric formulas to create the contents of your image this is perfect for graphics that need to have clean edges on the scale up significantly [Music] so the last one is called scan conversion so its configuration is a process of representing graphics objects a collection of pixels the graphics objects are continuous the pixel views are discrete each pixel can have an either on or off state so let us now proceed to the different components of a computer graphics [Music] the first component is modeling by modeling its defining objects in terms of primitives coordinates and characteristic modeling in the technical use of the term refers to the translation of objects or phenomena from the real world into mathematical equations computer modeling is the representation of three-dimensional objects on a computer using some form of software designed for the purpose the next one is story restoring means saving or restoring scenes and images in memory and on physical disk the next one is manipulating by manipulating it changing the shape position and characteristic of objects it refers to the multiplication made to images the next one is rendering by rendering it means applying physical base procedures to generate for photorealistic images from scenes using lighting and shading rendering or image synthesis is the process of generating a photorealistic or image from a 2d or 3d model the last one is viewing viewing discuss about displaying images from various viewpoints on various devices [Music] let us now proceed for the framework for interacting graphics when its a framework uh it consists of input and output devices graphic system an application program and application model a computer receives input from input devices and outputs image to a display device the input and out of device are called hardware component so it is as you could see from this conceptual framework is how the computer graphics started from input devices and achieved its final form through the output devices and now thats the end of our discussion about the fundamentals of computer graphics and i hope that you have learned something about this topic and you will be able to remember it on the implementation of various projections on our next topic about computer graphics
