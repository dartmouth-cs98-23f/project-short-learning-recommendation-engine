This is Sahn. In todays video, Im going to share with you our   proven strategies for crushing  your system design interviews. Having interviewed countless candidates, I’ve  seen up close what works and what falls short   when it comes to preparing  for these tough interviews. Stick with me for the next few minutes,  and I’ll guide you through a preparation   approach that’ll have you tackling any  system design question with confidence. Lets dive right in! First off, you might be wondering:  what is a system design interview? At a high level, its purpose  is to assess your ability to: One, translate an ambiguous problem statement  into concrete technical requirements. Two, craft an architecture and design  that satisfies those requirements. Three, articulate and defend your design  decisions throughout the discussion. You’ll be asked to design large scale systems  like an Instagram feed, Uber ride sharing,   Twitter timelines, or even the  infrastructure behind Google Search. Remember, there’s no such thing as  the right or “perfect” solution. The goal is to demonstrate  your technical expertise,   your approach to problem solving, and  your skills to communicate effectively. Now, you may be wondering - why should we care  about preparing for system design questions? Whats the big deal? Well, here’s the main reason: Your performance in a system design  interview can often determine whether   you land a senior engineer position, or if  you’re considered for a more junior role. Once you’ve clocked in a  few years in the industry,   system design is how companies gauge your  ability to build complex systems at scale. Essentially, shine bright in  the system design interview,   and you’re on track for those senior titles. But if you hit bumps along the way, you could  be looking at offers for more junior positions. So it pays to put in the work and  take these interviews seriously. You might be thinking: How on earth can these companies assess our  abilities in such a short period of time? And you’d be right - they can’t, not fully. These interviews are, in many ways,  proxies for real-world scenarios. They are an approximation at best. It’s on us to help the interviewers get the  signals they need so they can vouch for us. It’s not a perfect system, by any means,   but companies are always wary of  the repercussions of a wrong hire. These simulated challenges are often the  best tool they have at their disposal. So, how should we prepare for  these demanding interviews? Here’s a blueprint that’s consistently  worked for acing system design questions: First and foremost, practice,  practice, and practice. Get hands-on with designing real-world  apps and services we use regularly,   like Instagram, Uber, and Gmail. Just reading about the underlying  architectures isn’t enough. Take out a pen and paper and draw! We must push ourselves to sketch out the core  components and how they interact with one another. For example, design the backend  architecture for Instagram from scratch. Think through the key parts like the  frontend clients that users interact with,   the application servers processing millions  of requests, the caching mechanisms to speed   up response times, the dedicated databases for  storing posts, comments and feeds, and of course,   the distributed object storage essential  for hosting billions of photos and videos. Then sketch out how the main flows work - like how  would an end-user’s image get uploaded and stored? How would the algorithms determine  the order of posts in a user’s feed? How would the system leverage cached data  and when would it make database calls? Actively constructing each piece of the puzzle not   only deepens understanding  but reinforces retention. Next, study common design patterns like  load balancing, database sharding, content   delivery networks, caching frequently  accessed data, just to name a few. Know the pros and cons of  different approaches so you   can intelligently weigh tradeoffs in the design. If you’re interested, we have plenty of videos  on many system design patterns on this channel. When studying these patterns, anticipate the types   of questions an interviewer may ask  and practice responding confidently. For example, questions like Why did you  choose Redis for caching instead of Memcached? Be ready to dive into technical details  like Redis’ superior data structures and   its persistence options, to justify your choices. Also, get very comfortable using whiteboards,  diagramming apps, and other visual tools. In many interviews, youll be required  to visually represent your thoughts. Whether its a whiteboard during an  in-person interview or a diagramming   application for virtual setups,  become proficient with these tools. You want the tools themselves to be  second nature so you can focus on   communicating the design effectively,  not struggling with the interface. And finally, do regular mock  interviews to practice end-to-end. Nothing beats real-time practice that mimics  the settings and pressures of the real deal. Get feedback not just on the technical  design, but also on your communication skills,   ability to think on your feet, and on how  efficiently you manage the allotted time. Use mock interviews as a mirror, reflecting  areas of strength and those needing improvement. During the interview, start out by asking targeted   questions to deeply understand the  use cases, scalability requirements,   technical constraints, and other key  parameters before starting your design. Avoid the temptation to dive right into proposing   features – first nail down the  core requirements and scope. Be hyper aware of managing your time wisely. Between introductions, clarifying questions,  diagramming, and minor interruptions,   your actual design time is far less  than the full interview length. Every minute counts, so pace yourself  appropriately and keep moving forward. Identify any potential time sinks in advance. As you diagram out components,   flows and bottlenecks, think out loud and  verbally walk through your thought process. Explain your rationale, trade-offs,   and decisions - don’t make the interviewer  guess what’s going on in your head. Vocalize assumptions as well. As you walk through your design,  document the key aspects on the   whiteboard so the interviewer  can follow your thought process. Break the system into logical components. Highlight the main data flows  and dependencies between them. Avoid getting bogged down in  low-level details - focus on   architecting the high-level  design and broader tradeoffs. If you get stuck, take a breath and dont panic. Ask clarifying questions to resolve uncertainties. Think through issues incrementally  and systematically to get unblocked. Overcoming obstacles and making progress with  incomplete information is part of the challenge.
