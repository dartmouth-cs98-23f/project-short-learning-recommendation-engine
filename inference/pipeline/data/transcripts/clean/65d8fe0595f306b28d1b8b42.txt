welcome you all to the session in this session we shall learn the concept of version control in general we shall learn the basics of version control system followed by the benefits of the system and finally we shall have a look at some of the best version control systems in the market but before we begin make sure youre subscribed to our youtube channel and dont forget to click on the bell icon so you never miss an update from simply learn to start learning about the version control system lets begin by talking about a use case imagine theres a multinational company that has offices spread over several countries with thousands of employees so when it is such a big company there might be a set of issues and challenges it would face what could be the possible set of challenges the company faces the company faces the challenge to collaborate there are so many people located at different places there may be a need to communicate for a particular reason or a set of people who are working on the same project but from different regions second challenge is related to storing versions the project is not completed in a single version there may be n number of versions in that situation the problem of storing all such commits in a single place is a huge challenge then another problem is restoring previous versions sometimes it is important to go back to the previous versions to find the root cause of any bug one more common challenge is to figure out what happened at times it is critical to know what changes are made to the previous version of the source code or where exactly has the changes been made in a file then comes the problem of backup in case the system or the disk of the user breaks down and there is no backup then all the efforts will go in vain these are some of the basic problems that any small or big company might encounter now the question arises what could be a possible solution to all such problems and this is when the version control system comes into picture the version control system will take care of the collaboration between employees storing different versions will help in having backups on the remote repository it will also help in rolling back to the previous commits and to the last version of the source code we will talk about each of these reasons in detail when we learn the benefits of the version control system lets first have a look at what is version control as the name version control suggests it refers to the category of software tools that make it possible for the software team to look after the changes made to the source code the system records all the mail changes to a file so a specific version may be rolled if needed in future it is the responsibility of the version control system to keep all the team members on the same page it makes sure that everyone on the team is working on the latest version of the files and most importantly make sure that all these people can work simultaneously on the same project lets try to understand the process with the help of this picture there are three workstations or three different developers at three different locations and theres one repository that is acting as a server the workstations are using the repository either for the process of committing or updating the tasks there may be a larger number of workstations using a single server repository each workstation will have its own working copy and all these workstations will be saving their source codes into a particular server repository this makes it easy for any developer to access the task being done using the repository in case the system of any particular developer breaks down then also the work wont stop as there will be a copy of the source code in the central repository now after knowing the basics of version control its time for us to check the benefits of version control the first and the foremost advantage of the version control system is that it helps in managing and protecting the source code the system helps in management of the source code for the software team by keeping track of all the modifications that are being made to the code it also protects the source code from any unintended human error and consequences then the next advantage is it keeps record of all the modifications made to the code as we learned in the previous step the way it manages the code for the software team the team is working continuously producing new source codes and it is making amendments to the already existing code these changes are to be recorded for future references and in case they are needed to discover the root cause of any particular problem then the third advantage here talks about comparing earlier versions of the code as we saw that all the versions of the source code are saved this makes it possible for developers to go back at any time and compare the earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while reducing disruption to all team members the fourth and the final benefit we shall see is that the version control system supports developers workflow and not any rigid way of working any good version control system will not impose any particular way of working the version control systems are known to provide smooth continuous flow of changes made to the code and prevent developers from getting frustrated in the course of this mechanism now towards the end of the video lets have a look at some of the best version control systems in the market today the first one here is github then comes git lab followed by perforce and bean stock then on number fifth we have aws code commit moving further we have apache subversion team foundation server and mercurial finally we have bitbucket and concurrent version control and now with this we have come to the end of this session i hope you guys found it informative and helpful thanks for watching and stay tuned for more from simpler hi there if you like this video subscribe to
