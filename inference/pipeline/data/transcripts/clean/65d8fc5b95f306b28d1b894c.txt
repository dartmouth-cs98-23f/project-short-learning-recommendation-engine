[Music] [Music] [Music] yeah youre listening to autodesks digital Builder podcast a show that inspires construction professionals to innovate and use technology to improve how they build our world Im Eric Thomas and Ive been working in construction for nearly a decade and now I have the privilege to sit down with industry Trailblazers to hear how theyre solving constructions biggest challenges and redefining the future of the built environment all right welcome to another episode of Autodesk digital Builder podcast we are coming to you live from Autodesk University it is the first of three days right now our first interview for the week actually so Im excited I hope uh you are as well Im sitting down today with Tanya custus the director of AI research with Autodesk today were going to talk a little bit about what the heck AI is what ml is artificial intelligence machine learning what those impacts are and you know really leaning in on the the concept of why those tools are not scary and theyre actually going to be our friend moving forward so Im very grateful for uh Tanya to join me today and uh you know dispel some of those rumors Tanya how are you doing today were back at at you its great doing great yeah its great to be here theres so many people here its exciting to be back in Vegas yeah theres a Id say what thousands of people staring at us right now so no big deal or any pressure right now Im really excited to build on what we did last year at AES University in New Orleans and so were going to have a super fun conversation and were going to get into the thi of it so can you tell me a little bit more what does your team do at Autodesk because its its incredibly interesting and Id really love if you could kind of give an overview of your role as AI research lead so my team does fundamental and applied AI research so we um extend and Advance the state-of-the-art in Ai and machine learning and you know in areas that can be applied to Autodesk products um doing computer science research uh doesnt look that interesting um were not like its not like a chemistry lab with um lab coats or anything but you know its a lot of people in front of computers running experiments and um we do a lot of research on deep learning and generative AI for 3D 2D and C geometry youve got a robust amount that youre covering your teams doing some really cool stuff which is is great and I think it gives us a fantastic foundation for the rest of our conversation to kind of do away with those myths that we were talking about but the the media cycle is is a buzz right now about the impact of artificial intelligence and I think thats been growing for months and I was hoping you could give me some context why is this explosion of AI media happening and what do these what do these tools do right so why now um Ive been doing this for the last 15 years and let me tell you no one has ever been interested in what I do until now um my parents have not understood what Ive done till now um I deal with that all the time so um you know this isnt new okay the math isnt new um AI is not new its its more that weve reached this kind of Tipping Point where data is in the cloud its in a place where we can run compute on it and so the collocation of data and compute is super important to why were seeing this now but then also the side you know which leads to the size of the models and they be have become useful to people they become almost humanlike so theyve theyve become interesting like previously they were not so interesting yeah theyve come to a point where they can help people save time and so you know like 10 years ago I worked um at a place where we were generating summaries of legal legal briefs and legal cases the editors took more time to fix the garbage the computer generated then it took them to just write things but now were at that Tipping Point where you can generate something and the editor can save time by just editing that thing that the computer generated so thats why now you know its its such a great inflection point too and Im hearing more folks talk about Ai and our data and managing their data in a in a really robust way that I wasnt hearing 2 3 4 years ago and I think the light bulb is starting to turn on people are starting to understand as you just alluded to like this is going to save me time this is going to make a big impact on the work that I do in my business and so theres theres just a lot happening right now and Im excited Im glad that youre excited and your teams doing so much fantastic work but could you dive into that ambiguity Gap a little bit for me right now so I think a lot lot of the challenge that we deal with is folks dont necessarily understand what these different tools and Technologies do and that is the Catalyst for the anxiety that folks are feeling and so Id love it if you could you know lift the curtain a little bit and give a high level overview of you know what artificial intelligence is what machine learning is and you know what large language models are because I think that buzzword is starting to show up more often now too definitely definitely is um so generally we will Define artificial intelligence AI as capabilities that are being done by a computer that are typically thought of as being done by a human Okay so tasks that a human usually does theyre being done by a computer so its a pretty wide definition um machine learning is a subset of AI so not all AI is machine learning but machine learning is all AI the layer Nuance is exciting and machine learning is when we learn we use the computer learns from data so its learning patterns and probabilities and and other information from the data itself like classification things um recommendation algorithms a lot a lot of things you see every day are just simple you know machine learning large language models are models built with machine learning and they are built on huge amounts of data and what they are trained to do the training objective of large language models is is to predict the next word which sounds so boring um however when you can do that and you can do it at scale you also get a ton of other tasks for free you get things like question answering summarization um even answering like math problems so you know theres that scale is something that I think surprised all of us um because we had never trained at that scale before we can use it for almost anything that we use traditional machine learning for like classification and and things like that so yeah its a really really interesting place to be um but but again theyre not perfect they dont do everything and they literally only predict the next word its they also sound very confident so psychologically you would really like to believe them but they literally know nothing they know no facts what they are exceedingly good at large language models is syntax linguistic syntax so like structure of language and and theres so much there especially with the the way that I can learn from data and when I talk to construction folks on the regular I I really lean in on Data standards and being really intent with the way they capture the data because that impacts everything youre talking about so heavily as you start building on that its the garbage in garbage out you know acronym where everybody goes okay well you you know put everything in at random and you know youre going to get random back out if youre not you know being very deliberate about how you set that up and so I think it it really is an exciting moment for our industry because were were starting to step back and say okay where where does this get to augment what were doing where can it make improvements and I think thats where I really like to emphasize with folks that this isnt the the scary Skynet thats coming at you right now were were at this opportunity where you say Okay a computer can do something at scale that I cant do as a person or can do it much more quickly and now I get to go home at five instead of seven or I get to go do something else and 100% you know thats that that feels a lot better than this weird big brothery Vibe of somebody watching everything youre doing like thats not the value and thats not what people are doing no and honestly computers really are quite stupid or I would not have a job so you know they they dont learn what you dont teach them number one and a lot of the Skynet you know Terminator scenarios thanks movies yeah are are from movies and its also a little bit of like psychological projection right so whenever someone is afraid of like AI doing bad stuff Im like well what bad stuff are you going to do you know no Tech is neutral and its the people behind it that you know do bad stuff right so like databases you could use those for a lot of bad things but again its not the databases fault but we tend to anthropomorphize Ai and sort of like treat it like its a person a little bit and so there is a weird um psychological aspect to it as well but but honestly like AI is very not scary yeah and and I feel like everything youre sharing right now there theres a bit of a confirmation bias in there too where you go oh the bad thing happened and we noticed but how many times was the technology leveraged perfectly where nothing happened and it was just the most boring thing ever but you got to go home at 5 and if its intuitive yeah if its if it makes sense to you you dont notice it right like yeah like every every predictive texting suggestion you get you know 99 out of 100 are great and then you get one thats really weird and then you like laugh at how bad the algorithm is yeah okay yeah youre happy with your Google home mini until its you know doing the wrong thing and then youre yelling at it or at least I am in my house dont tell anybody about that one but i Id like to move a little bit on into uh generative AI because thats another topic that comes up fairly regularly so can you tell me what what the heck is generative Ai and and what role does it have with in the construction industry just with AI generally um in the past traditional AI weve been encoding things so weve been taking a lot of information and kind of compressing it down and encoding it now what were doing is were taking those encodings and decoding them and in so doing it generates things okay so so its sort of just like The Logical next step of figuring out how to do stuff with AI generative AI is when you put in a prompt and that prompt could be you know a word it could be a phrase it could be part of a drawing it could be you know an image whatever right and then the output of the algorithm actually generates the output for you so its not like search where its just finding the output its actually you know generating so we see it a lot with um language models like we were talking about so chat gbt right can um you know you give it a question it generates an answer you um give it a couple articles and it will generate a summary for you thats what were seeing and I think well see it more and more because generating things saves people time we can take pictures of a construction site and generate possible code violations heres a drawing and it can generate you know try these materials right so so theres anything where you kind of you know yeah generate anything namesake makes sense when you start digging a little bit in but you know anybody in construction now it it makes so much sense to think about these tools in their application because is the the labor shortages are not going away and anything that we can do to improve how our teams are able to go to work and do things at scale with less time and increasingly less resources available is a huge win and so Im really excited to start seeing you know all these shifts and all the buzz but we have to obviously parse whats real and what isnt as we kind of get into it but i Id like to take a look at uh some of the exciting announcements that came out today during our keynote so I know Andrew shared some exciting things can you share your reaction to some of these developments and the the impacts that theyre going to bring to Autodesk customers yeah absolutely I mean I think the the takeaways at least from my standpoint today were one you know we have been doing AI yeah this this isnt new so its not new um but you know looking more at how do we leverage and sort of sew that AI together into an open platform um you know that approach is so important because data is so important and you cant do AI without data but also capturing the workflow and how the data moves through the workflow is is also just such an important part of AI because youre again youre predicting things so you want to be able to predict whats next and you cant predict whats next if you dont know what the next thing thats going to happen is like in the design workflow for example the importance of context also so like what Amy was talking about with um importing different contexts and contextual information again that is so important to you know the more the more data you give the computer the more it Im not going to say understands but the better it can predict you know and thinking about um how we use AI at different levels right so we can use AI for analysis right so thats you know I have a lot of data I aggregated it and I learned these really interesting things right like that is great and you know but beyond that we can automate things right so boring things that designers dont want to do or that that take them a lot of time and then beyond that like you were talking about before augmentation so like thats the ultimate goal right like we want to make the computer better but we also want to make the human better right so like peanut butter and chocolate right all of those things sort of build on each other and I think you know Andrew did a good job of of sort of setting it up that way and and we dont want to take the humanity out of what were doing as well like absolutely you see a lot of the buzz in the news right now where somebody goes oh were gonna you know AI music and everything else its like no like we want to automate the things people dont want to do so I can go sit on a beach and play music instead of you know doing some middle drawing you know takeoffs for 19 years or whatever it happens to be ex and you know AI its its a how not a what so we talk about like I want to do AI like okay but what do you want what problem are you solving right and AI honestly is not always the answer its not always the best way to solve a problem and so you know its a really important tool in a modern software engineering toolbox but you know you need to use it when its right and when its appropriate and I think you know obviously people want to use it because its cool and fun but you know theres theres a lot of problems you dont need it for either yeah absolutely I think thats where that the hype narrative comes up a little bit sometimes we go I think every technology company regardless of what industry theyre in in the last six months has announced something with I and its just like well does that really do anything for your customers or did you think that that was important for round you know raising your series B round or something right and I mean so ultimately a new product should address like a either a customer need you havent addressed in the past or you know we have plenty of products that we could just you know replace the guts of with AI and improve them right and and in those cases maybe you wont notice and maybe thats good that you dont notice right because its working yeah sometimes thats okay if its in the background its just amplifying the workflows that you have but I think I think that leads into my next question actually can you talk a little bit about the the real risks that might you know come from introducing AI technology and how the teams that are developing the tools are really making sure that theyre protecting our friends working in a first of all a data right so like you said garbage in garbage out making sure that you have the right data to train the right use cases so important there are a lot of things were learning about different kinds of data right we dont have all the answers um sometimes processing data one way will lead to better results sometimes you know that theres theres a lot of Science and experimentation going on which is a lot of what my team does um but again its looking at whats the right tool for the job theres always going to be danger in construction work what were aiming for is to make it safer and using aii in ways that will make it safer so like augmentation maybe like seeing things or or patterns or trends that people are not seeing like what are the strengths of using AI for something and then you know using it correctly and I think not taking the human out of the loop is really important for things that are dangerous and were also working um on my team to do a lot of AI alignment which is where we look at the output of the algorithms and we then kind of train secondary algorithms or use reinforcement learning to align them to what is either safer or people like better right um and you know so that that also is a really important tool for what were doing in the safety conversations one that I I really like using it as an example actually because you think about it from you know a large project $200 million Construction project youve got your safety professionals on site they do their site walks theyre looking for risks theyre analyzing all these things technology can analyze these risks at a scale that a person cant do yeah and so if youre doing uh different types of scanning photography the technology can look for fall hazards or scaffolding issues thats not to say that your super shouldnt go out and do these site walks or anything because that human element is so important but what it means is youre just getting so much more opportunity to check and see if everything is safe and at a at a level that just a human just cant do its just not possible its processing more information for you yeah right so its augmenting yep you and anybody on a construction site knows first thing you think about and last thing you think about is going to be safety so absolutely you know anything we can do to improve that is going to be great is there anything else that we can do to reduce some of these you know Common concerns that folks have or fears about these tools anything else that comes to mind um I mean a lot of what I do is just education right explain today right explaining to people that its just math its not scary um explaining to people that its really the data that gives a company a competitive advantage in AI right so like Google and Bing if you look at both search engines you know Bing probably has better algorithm to be honest but Google has a lot more data right and so the data really is that competitive advantage and I think you know educating people how it works demystifying it is really important um but just you know transparency making sure people feel that their privacy is being protected or just when theyre interacting with a tool being transparent that hey this this is AI right or this you know this recommendation was generated by a computer like and giving them choices right so here are a bunch of recommendations you can take them or not take them and thats totally cool and thats totally different than having it generate one answer and forcing them to use it right this is it weve seen when it makes mistakes and what it does you kind of back away and no thank you ex so a lot of it is like how do we interact with it in a design workflow especially even if you have another person generating something for you behind the scenes you probably dont want it or or dont love it as much as your own right and so you know it is about that choice and using the AI like a collaborator I think is will go a long way towards building trust I appreciate that and that that continued education and the conversation around it especially as it becomes more and more Buzzy I I think is incredibly important its unfortunate almost that weve had all these Terminator movies and everything and somebody goes artificial intelligence theyre coming like I wish I could have Arnold pop out right now or something join our conversation to help dissuade some of the uh the myths around it but sadly I called them a couple times and he wasnt available so well just have to roll solo but Ive got a couple more questions for you today one more on AI can you can you tell me a little bit more more about the aspects of artificial intelligence that people are not talking about and they and what else should they be talking about like where are those gaps in the narrative right now that youre seeing sort of the no Tech is neutral situation right like again this is the next step of software engineering weve been using software for a long time right and so thinking of AI as something totally different than just using software I mean its its harmful but also a little naive um and you know just really people dont think enough about the data they dont think enough about you know theyre like I want to do AI well like first you have to put your data in the cloud and thats probably boring and hard then you have to organize it in certain ways which again is like feels very remedial to people who want this big fireworks moment right they want it now yeah they want it now and and you know and a lot of AI is built on like smaller AI a lot of times the first thing things youre going to see out of using AI are I mean kind of boring theres a patient aspect to it theres the interface aspect right were in control of how people interact with our AI making sure that the customers know that theyre in control of their workflow that were trying to help them were not trying to replace them right I think all of those things are just super super important and theres no secret math right my team and I we publish a lot of papers and its because the AI research Community is super open no one company has like some secret box of technology that hidden tool that were all going to sneak in I mean no one does it is a very open conversation in the scientific Community I wish more people would learn about it so theyre not afraid um but but yeah its very open its its math honestly like are you afraid of math I mean kind of there theres a reason why I didnt go well I I abandoned engineering school just leave it at that all right well well I I appreciate that level set and and I think the point that you made about just the importance of you know just cleaning house with your data is huge we did a research report with FMI a couple years ago it was called harnessing the data advantage and construction and we really just leaned in on what folks were doing where were they concerned where were the success factors were and we found that a lot of people sit in a state of decision paralysis right now because they dont know where to start because it is overwhelming I I I have so much empathy for an organization especially a large one that hasnt standardized fully in a certain way and how they capture data or had the opportunity to think about what they want to do with their data which is I think the important part about where you start you got to go what what do you want to achieve you dont just start Gathering data madly exactly and when you think about that then you get to start identifying those little areas where you go okay where where is our TCH stack set up so well that making improvements on our data is going to have an impact with without as much of a burden you fix that and then youve got a win you get to show this to your team and you go look at this and now this cloud-based tool can figure this out what if we did this everywhere else and then you slowly start building if you try to boil the ocean with your entire data strategy and youve got none to start with its a losing proposition because youre just going to be so overwhelmed got pick that Focus area absolutely again that sort of Paradigm of like analyze automate and then augment right like those go in in an order and theyre you know progressively more thing you know more magnitude of things you can do with that data as you get it into shape for use so I think were uh Weve covered the gamut as far as high level on what the heck AI is and why you know people shouldnt be afraid of hanging out and uh you know installing some tool whether its chat GPT or something theres a theres a myriad of things you can jump into and of course Autodesk has announced some new stuff and weve been doing a lot of cool stuff with regards to data as well so dont forget about that but moving on to our final question what is one tool that you will always use on any project that you work on Creative problem solving I like it its the number one thing I look for when I hire people um you know my my undergrad degrees is in music my grad degrees are in linguistics and Im here talking to you about construction so I like but it makes sense when we talk through it your your uh your background is so impressive so Im really glad that were here yeah being able to take something you know from somewhere and apply it to a new place you know AI is inherently interdisciplinary and and its you know the thing I use every single day I like it and I think the the creative Focus that folks can bring to the table really helps us think about like what that what that what can we do whats possible whats the options and then you know we start trying things out and see where were at and you know a few years hopefully the the level of automation as we move further and further into the cloud is going to continue to increase and I think I think thats applicable to you know no matter what industry youre working in whether its construction or you know any of the other industries that AES serves or otherwise so absolutely well thank you so much for joining me today on digital builder for everybody who is sitting and staring at me right now and listening to the show of course I am your host Eric Thomas we are a weekly podcast a video first podcast as you might notice with all these cameras pointing directly at me right now if you are interested in checking out another episode make sure you head over to the Autodesk construction Cloud digital Builder blog or you can find me on LinkedIn at Builder unor digital and uh if you also have a moment and you like what were up to Id appreciate if you take a second to you know rate US five stars and whatever player that you listen to and uh without further Ado [Music] goodbye
