recall by dataiku video my name is tina and im a data scientist that works in tech in this video were going to talk about software engineering versus data science in practice this video will be divided into four different parts first lets talk about what is data science and what is software engineering then lets talk about the similarities the differences and finish off with in my opinion why you should choose one or the other i want to preface this video by saying first that software engineering and data science rules can be very different depending on the company the industry and even the specific team in the company theres also roles such as data engineering machine learning or ml engineering and data science ml research roles that share some similarities with both software engineering and data science so do please keep in mind that its not always super clean cut and theres lots of overlap specifically in this video though im going to be talking about software engineering versus data science okay first up lets define data science and software engineering data science is defined as a combination of multiple fields including statistics scientific methods artificial intelligence ai and data analysis to extract value from data in essence is the usage of a bunch of different fields to get valuable integration from data some example projects that data science will do are things like say like creating a product sales forecasting model perhaps using a machine learning based solution also things like creating and analyzing experiments that test out different versions of a website for example and analyzing data to help companies make a decision on where they should be investing the most money on the other hand software engineering is defined as a systematic disciplined quantifiable approach to the development operation and maintenance of software that is the application of engineering to software here its about applying engineering principles to software to solve problems and build products so some example projects would include building a web application creating infrastructure to allow processes to run with increased efficiency and automating certain processes like creating an automated trading bot for example these are just some examples to illustrate what projects may look like for data scientists and software engineers but really both these fields are incredibly vast and diverse and theres just so many different types of projects hopefully though these give you some insights into what software engineers and data science work on next up lets talk about similarities between software engineering and data science one similarity between data science and software engineering is that they both involve coding in some form data scientists generally use code in order to take one or more data sets and use them to implement things like models perform analyses and to create visualizations usually the code is not reused beyond the original purpose with the exception of deploying models into production that are meant to be reused common languages include sql python and r on the other hand software engineers use code to build products and services that are often meant to be used by lots of end users this is why coding and software engineering is generally far more rigorous than in data science the code standard for software engineering is far higher and its common to conduct many tests on the code to make sure that all the use cases are covered some common examples of coding languages include python javascript c c sharp as well as java so overall both data scientists and software engineers code as part of their day-to-day jobs although the nature of coding is actually quite different another big similarity between data science and software engineering is that they are both widely applicable to lots of different fields say if you have a career in like investment banking marketing or like medicine youre likely to stay in your respective field since your expertise is specific to that domain where at least you wont travel too far from your original domain but this restriction does not apply for data scientists and software engineers both of these careers are very skill based and people can take their skills and apply it across different companies and industries using myself as an example i started my data science journey in bioinformatics specifically cancer genomics i then worked for a bit in finance and finally ended up in tech similarly i also know a lot of friends of mine who did the same computer science degree as me and then worked as software engineers in a variety of different places like hedge funds e-commerce pharma and tech however this is not to say that switching industries is like no effort you will definitely need some time to ramp up in the company and the new field and youll need to learn some domain knowledge but in general this is not that hard to do in my opinion learning the technical skills is far harder than learning things like domain specific concepts and terminology the next similarity between software engineering and data science is that both these fields require you to do a lot of problem solving these are not fields where you can memorize concepts or terminology the core skill that you develop for both of these fields is problem solving because there are so many problems for example software engineering you may be faced with a specific task you need to do but you have never seen anything like it before so you have to think through a task try to break it down into its components and think of the logic and how you can kind of like fit things together to complete your task you probably get stuck a lot too and consult the coding savior which is stack overflow to try to solve your problem you probably also spend a lot of your time if like not most of your time trying to figure out how to fix a bug in your code to fix it you first try to reproduce it then test out the assumptions that you think might be causing it again problem solving data science also centers around problem solving youre spending a lot of time wrestling with the data to get it to yield some precious insights youre coming up with a hypothesis testing it out sometimes over and over again to try to discover a negative insight you may also run into the issue of your data not being in the correct format to use a statistical model where to use a machine learning model so then you need to figure out what is the correct format and then how to transform your data to that format youll probably also be consulting the coding savior stack overflow or its cousin for math and stats stack exchange problem solving is fundamental to both software engineering and data science and as a secondary skill patience another similarity between software engineering and data science is that youre expected to learn a lot of things as new technologies are coming out both fields have a lot of new innovations coming out every month if not every week or every day new languages new ways of doing things and new infrastructures to be able to keep up with everything is of course not possible however part of your job is to keep tabs on the new technologies that are coming out and also kind of like pick and choose the ones that you think are going to be the most useful for you self learning and upskilling is very common among software engineers and data scientists and this ability to learn quickly and efficiently is a skill that will take you far now speaking about learning things if you are interested in learning more about data science including machine learning algorithms and up and coming technologies you should definitely check out dataikus free learning resource linked in the descriptions the learning material is really beginner friendly with lots of illustrations and examples data iq itself is also the cutting edge of data science and artificial intelligence by systemizing the use of data and providing a single central solution for the design deployment and management of ai applications so if youre interested in data science you should definitely check out how the field is progressing now lets talk a little bit about the differences so the first major difference between software engineering and data science is what i call a building versus discovering mindset software engineering is very much about building things and using good engineering principles to make sure that the things you build are efficient meet the desired specifications and can stand the test of time with a software engineering project you spend a lot of time up front figuring out and designing what you want your end product to look like then you would go and implement with the goal of getting this end product now for data science its centered around what i call a discovery mindset you do your research and you form a hypothesis then you go out there and look at your data and try to manipulate it analyze it and ultimately make sense of it your goal is to discover new insights from the data so theres no like well-defined end goal in mind this difference between building versus discovering is actually well represented by the names of the roles themselves a software engineer is fundamentally an engineer that builds but specifically builds with software a data scientist is fundamentally a scientist but specifically discovers using data okay so second difference between the two fields is that data science is very interdisciplinary while software engineering is more narrow in scope what i mean by this is that data science is essentially a combination of coding math and stats and business youre expected to be proficient at each of these skills to be a good data scientist sometimes you expect to do analyses sometimes to do models sometimes to design statistically sound experiments sometimes to communicate with stakeholders and sometimes to build data pipelines in comparison a software engineers major skill sets are in designing implementing and maintaining software through code many software engineers liken coding as a specific skill like carpentry or blacksmithing that they continuously try to hone this difference between data science and software engineering is another big reason why the two fields actually tend to attract really different people data science generally attracts people who enjoy learning about and like combining different fields while software engineering often attracts people who are interested in becoming like better and better at a specific craft the third difference is that the responsibilities of a software engineer are more well-defined than the responsibilities of a data scientist if you come in as a software engineer you usually have a pretty clear idea of what your responsibilities are if youre an android developer for example you expect to be working on developing android apps if youre a cloud developer youre expected to be designing building and maintaining cloud systems and if youre a web developer you expect to be developing something for the web although web development itself is pretty huge and you can get even more specializations like front-end and back-end and full-stack web development but case in point theres a lot of specializations with relatively clearly defined responsibilities for data scientists though the role and expectations are often not clearly defined what it is that youre supposed to do varies a lot depending on the company the industry and the team even within the same company a data scientist that works on one team can be doing something completely different from a data scientist and another team this is mostly because data science as a field is far less mature than software engineering so there are not as many specializations and expectations set in place for specific roles companies often use data science as kind of like a catch-all for data related work that involves some sort of coding with that being said though as the field is maturing the differences between data scientists data analysts research scientists machine learning engineer and data engineer are becoming more distinct and in the future i think these roles would be more clearly defined and head in the same direction as software engineering after discussing the similarities and differences between software engineering and data science if youre trying to decide yourself whether you should be choosing software engineering or data science here are some key factors that you should consider at least in my opinion remember what we discussed earlier about how software engineers have a building mindset while data scientists have a discovery mindset i think this is one of the most important factors to consider do you get excited about building things with an end goal in mind or do you get more excited about discovering things that you dont know about before me personally i get very excited about discovering new things and that weighed in really heavily into going into data science a second key consideration is how much you like to code if you see coding as a craft that you wish to hone over time then you may be more suited for software engineering if you care more about using code as a tool to achieve your purposes but youre not like particularly excited about the coding itself then you may want to consider data science finally how willing are you to learn interdisciplinary fields both software engineering and data science involve learning a lot of new things however data science is emerging of the very different fields of computer science math and business so if youre not interested in all these different areas or at least like willing to learn about all these areas then data science may not be for you i do want to point out that something that you should not be so worried about is the salary both software engineering and data science pay extremely well and youll have a similar compensation throughout your career all right so what do you think do you lean more towards data science or software engineering do leave a comment below one final thing i just want to say if you really cant choose between one or the other theres actually a lot of software engineers that become data scientists and vice versa so dont stress out about it too much all right thats all i have for you today thanks so much for watching and i will see you guys in the next video
