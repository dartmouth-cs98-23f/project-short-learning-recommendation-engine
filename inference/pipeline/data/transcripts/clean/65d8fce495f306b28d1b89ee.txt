welcome back to this wonderful journey of computer organization and architecture in this session we will be focusing on memory so lets get to learning wikipedia states memory is the faculty of brain by which data or information is encoded stored and retrieved when needed similarly in case of computers memory which was initially termed as store plays a similar role everything be it an image an audio file a text file or instructions for a key press or a mouse click if that is stored in the computer memory its actually encoded as bits basically each memory cell can have either zero or one and all these are comprised of millions of bits and processed by the processor the brain of the computer so we might think that having a single large memory unit is the solution to the situation but im afraid its not with the increasing size of the memory the time to access them gets increased and time is the essence here let me put it to you this way we know the processor is very fast i mean today we have gigahertz processors even in our smartphones suppose we have 2 gigahertz processor this means the frequency is 2 gigahertz hence time is 1 upon frequency that is 1 by 2 into 10 to the power 9. now how did i get this 10 to the power 9 lets have a chart shall we we know one kilo unit equals to 1000 units hence 10 cube units therefore one mega unit is 1 000 kilo units and thus 10 to the power 6 units and finally 1 giga units is 1 000 mega units and thus 10 to the power 9 units now coming back to our initial illustration 1 upon 2 into 10 to the power 9 seconds equals to 1 by 2 into 10 to the power minus 9 seconds and 10 to the power minus 9 seconds is 1 nanosecond therefore in half a nanosecond our processor can perform a single task so to conclude the cpu is fast not only fast real fast and keeping up with this kind of speed is tough because if our memory device is way slower than the cpu then the cpu will remain idle for the most of the time and we wont have an efficient machine also not only the speed the size and the cost are considered to when it comes to memory thats why we have various memory devices associated to our computer computer designers termed the memory to perform immediate tasks as primary memory and the memory which is used as a more permanent storage is known as secondary memory when we play an audio file our system manager that is the operating system manages the space within the primary memory to perform the instructions which is understanding the mouse click opening up the default application for playing the file after bringing it from the secondary storage into the primary memory now as because we need the execution of the instructions to be as quick as possible the sales in the primary memory can be accessed in any order and thats why the name random access memory or ram to be precise its actually dynamic ram because in each memory chip there is a transistor with which a capacitor is associated the transistors can retain the binary bit as long as the associated capacitors have charge so periodic recharging is needed for value retention and thats why its called dynamic but its still slow for the modern day processors so we opt for another fast memory storage the cache now the cache is made up of static ram which doesnt have any capacitors but they are very costly in comparison to the main or primary memory however cache happens to be the fastest memory storage among all others anyway all these be that cache or main memory are volatile that means they can only retain the data in them until the power is off therefore to store the data more permanently we opt for the next type of memory storage the secondary memory now secondary memories are slower than the main memory yet they can retain data permanently that is the data inside them are still there even if the power is off they are larger in terms of capacity also they are cheaper than the main memory we will definitely get into the detailed study of various types of secondary memories in our due course but for the time being i would like to take an example of one of the most popular secondary storage devices that is the hard disk drive to explain one of the reasons why these are slower compared to the main memory for a hard disk drive the axis is semi-random now why is so because using this red right head we can randomly get to any of these tracks but from there getting to the particular block where the data is stored requires sequential movement so the time to access any data in the hard disk drive becomes longer naturally now let me show you the big picture we have the processor and it has got its registers but these are not capable of storing large amount of data to be really honest they can barely store a single instruction so we opt for main memory yet main memory is also slow for the processor so we stored the frequently accessed stuffs in a smaller yet faster than main memory speed memory storage the cache its like keeping our phones in our pockets instead of the backpack that we are carrying because we tend to use the phone very frequently now the main memory and the cachet communicates using data word or block and the ways the communication takes place is known as cache memory mapping worry not we will learn every type of these in details later so having this organization does speed things up a notch but none of these retain data permanently so we need a permanent non-volatile storage the secondary memory using the virtual memory mapping technique the operating system lets the main memory and the auxiliary secondary storage communicate with one another using pages for this to happen the operating system must be capable of performing paging or demand paging fun fact the processor is aware of the presence of the registers the caches even the main memory but it has got no clue about the existence of the secondary memory there the operating system comes at rescue and manages all the things so to conclude having a single large memory is not really a solution instead we use different types of storage units in an organized fashion so that was all for this session in the next one we will get into the details of these memory storages and learn about the memory hierarchy hope to see you in the next one thank you all for watching you
