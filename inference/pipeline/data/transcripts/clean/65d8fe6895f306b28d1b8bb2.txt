youre going to see a lot of videos that have the title how Id learned to code if I could do it all over again personally I think that theres a lot of BS in these videos and I think that for a lot of viewers you dont know what to do so today were going to talk about how I would learn how to do web development in 2023 if I were just starting out its a no BS way to do it though who am I my name is Dylan I taught myself how to code during the pandemic and I currently work full-time as a programmer at a software startup on my channel I share all the lessons that I learned on my journey so if youre new kick back enjoy the ride lets jump in and if you really like this stuff make sure to hit that subscribe button Im going to give a quick PSA here learning web development learning software engineering learning how to code does not take three months youre going to see a lot of videos on YouTube telling you that you can become a Google software engineer in three months and make half a million dollars a year its not real I wouldnt believe it coding is a lifelong learning process it takes years to master Im only a few years in and I still consider my myself to be an amateur the second thing dont do Harvard cs50 Im not saying that its a bad course but a lot of people are going to steer you in the direction of taking this type of course and personally I dont think that its needed I think that by taking a course like Harvard cs50 youre further just kicking the can down the road if I were starting on day one I would hop on free code Camp I would start learning HTML and CSS in the basic web design course that free cocam offers thats what I did thats how I learned it it only took me three weeks to learn mind you I was really putting the hours in every day so thats why I got through it in three to four weeks so I think if youre committed you can do it in less than a month once youve completed the web design track on freecocamp I would go on to udemy or something similar and take a JavaScript course and learn the basics if I were doing it all over again I wouldnt try to become a JavaScript Master understand what a JavaScript function does before you list that youre a web developer on your resume like can you type out a function in the console like this is a super basic concept that you should know how to do this this is basic JavaScript once you finish a basic JavaScript and web development course on udemy I would build a project that youre interested in like ask yourself what are your interests what are your passions what do you like dont build a Netflix clone everybody does that dont build a meta clone everybody does that like you should be original do something that is unique and something that youre passionate about not what everybody else wants you to do an advantage of this approach is that when youre actually building the thing youre more likely to enjoy what it is that youre working on because you like the stuff that youre working on its something that youre actually passionate about so for me Im super interested in career development so I built a job board in vanilla JavaScript and I really like doing that because Im super interested in what it is that I was building make sure that you do it in the language stripped of any Frameworks this is important because it reinforces the fundamental Basics and understanding of the language of your choice like you want to know the basics like how to write a function how to write a for Loop in JavaScript its only until after youve built this project in the vanilla language of your choice that you can build it in a framework so after I was done building this project in vanilla JavaScript I then decided to rebuild the project and the framework of my choice which was react I was able to better understand react as a result because like I really understood the basics of JavaScript this is super important because a lot of people are going to tell you that you should immediately start building in the framework of your choice taking a quick pause here this video is not about getting a job Ive made a lot of other videos about that which Ill link up here but I wanted to say like in my opinion I dont think that you need to go to a boot camp and I dont think that you need to go back to school and get a CS degree the main advantage of these two options is honestly just the structure that is provided and you could also argue probably the community too but all the material that is offered its all free and cheap on the internet and like if you want Community just go to a meet-up theyre completely free and Meetup organizers want as many people there as possible lets say you have a bug in your code like go to a Meetup and ask people I bet that you can figure it out at that Meetup rather than paying a boot camp seventeen thousand dollars for them to listen to your problems for you a small rant theres so many options like theres so much out there and theres so many people trying to push you in the direction of paying them money so they can convince you that you can get a job in like three months like you might be able to by doing one of these programs but its highly unlikely like you have to put the work in so my message is this just Google it like youre gonna have to Google it and go on stack Overflow whether youre in a boot camp or doing a CS degree anyways so like you might as well just get really good at being resourceful yourself and like I said go to meetups for collaboration like if you have a bug or something go to a Meetup and Im sure you guys are going to be able to figure it out you can also use other resources like YouTube YouTube is amazing stack Overflow is great too and as I mentioned at the beginning of the video like theres no hacking your brain thats all a bunch of clickbait BS like you cant hack your brain to learn how to code its a brain its a muscle I think its a muscle like you have to just Google everything saying you have to learn to be resourceful learn how to struggle and learn how to learn its not about the actual coding language or web development technology itself its learning how to learn the actual Tech so in summary if I were just starting out I would hop on free cocamp and do the web design course its totally free and youll learn HTML and CSS if you put in the work every single day youll probably be able to get through it in three to four weeks then I would hop on udemy and take a JavaScript Focus course or something thats a little more comprehensive in web development Ill link a couple of example courses in the description and focus on just getting good at the basics of vanilla JavaScript and then take all those skills that you just learned from the last couple of courses and build a Project based on something that youre passionate about dont build a Netflix clone everybody does that you want to be original and also the advantage of doing something that youre interested in is that youre more likely to keep doing it because youre interested in doing it then when youre done building that project in vanilla JavaScript you can rebuild it in the framework of your choice and lastly you have to learn how to struggle you have to learn how to learn go and Google it like theres no brain hacks to this stuff you cant hack your brain and become more productive and learn how to code this is stuff that people try to sell you on the internet like its a brain come on you cant hack it its not a computer learn how to struggle and how to gird through problems the real way the way that everybody else does it so dont buy into the BS anyways that is how I would learn how to do web development in 2023 if I were just starting out again this is my bold take this is what I see on YouTube and what I disagree and agree with so if you like this content give this video a like so we can push it out to more people and hopefully motivate and Inspire others I make a lot of other videos like this so feel free to check another one out I appreciate any support on my channel comment below let me know what you think until next time peace thank you
