help us solve our existential problems but the journey to get to use for quantum computer is a difficult one even though in theory we think we can achieve this doing it in practice is a whole different thing our latest Quantum chip is the most powerful that weve ever made but it still needs to be thousands of times larger in order to solve all the Practical applications that people are excited about the problem is as you make it bigger you get more errors [Music] if you want to program a computer Quantum or non you need the bits to be able to remember the state you put them in but the quantum bits that we have today the qubits are error written theyre forgetful fortunately theres a scheme known as Quantum error correction where we can organize Quantum bits in such a way that you can build a bigger less error-prone system Quantum error correction holds this promise to be able to make Quantum Computing scale to these very large systems but no ones ever been able to make the actual system themselves good enough that as you scale it up it reduces the amount of errors that you have in order to make this experiment work a lot of things have to work at the same time the quantum chip all the qubits the fridge and the electronics and the cables and everything and so theres a lot of trial and error that goes into getting all this Hardware working together kept cranking over a period of months and at some point we thought we could really attempt the experiment fully for the first time but then we actually go to run the algorithm their performance was like was terrible the sophistication of the system and what were trying to do with it were beyond anything that we had ever done before and so we basically had to develop a new language that we used to make the chip do what we wanted to do and that took a lot of hard work from a lot of very smart and dedicated people communicating with the qubits is pretty tricky because we dont want them to interact with the environment on accident but we do want them to listen to the signal that were sending to them thats always but if suppose we can support us and its not just telling the qubits what to do we also need to get information back from the qubits so we can ask What state were you in at the beginning even though the errors were pretty high I felt like you know we can grind this out we can make it happen there were a lot of people on the team that were figuring out new ways to make the operations better new ways to make our decoding better is there another decoder that can get us there maybe after a few months it was definitely like Weighing on us like oh gee maybe this isnt actually going to work Id certainly say that resilience is strong on this team not everyone has the same approach to solving a particular challenge when progress slows you start to worry you know will we ever get there were pushing on the experiment were pushing on it were pushing on it and then finally it just clicks for the first time we have gone past the break even Point even though we went to a larger array of data qubits the error rate came slightly down we showed that Quantum error correction doesnt only work in theory but that it actually works in practice and what that does is it opens the door towards making very large and Powerful quantum computers in the future I am optimistic that equipped with a quantum computer humans will be able to solve problems that they couldnt otherwise is this palpable confidence on our teams that we will be able to complete our roadmap and build a large useful quantum computer is going to happen not too long from now [Music]
