Alex Freiburg and today were gonna be talking about the difference between a data scientist and a data analyst now as many of you know if you watch my channel I am a data analyst but what you may not know is that I actually work on a data science team and so I work alongside a lot of data scientists and so I know a lot of the work that they do and so I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of each position and the differences between these jobs and so were going through four main areas today which are responsibilities qualifications skills and then at the very end salary and after all of that Im going to talk about what position might be right for you so lets start off with responsibilities what kind of things are you gonna be working on in your actual job lets start off with data scientist as a data scientist youre gonna be using your data to discover opportunities and what that means is youre gonna be using your current data to find trends and patterns that are gonna affect the future business that you are working in youll also be developing analytical methods and machine learning models and most people when they think data scientists think that is the core work that theyre gonna be doing and that is actually not true thats actually probably five to ten percent of their job and most of the time they have these models set up that they used over and over and over again so they already know what kind of models theyre gonna be using they are just working with the data to put it into those models and then at the end theyre tweaking their hyper parameters to really narrow down their accuracy and get better results but genuinely they arent doing a ton of work in these machine learning models theyre not developing new models theyre just trying to fit their data into these models to get the best results they can out of them the next thing is data cleaning and when I say data cleaning I mean a lot of data cleaning because genuinely they are doing so much work just cleaning their data making sure its gonna be good and usable for their models so when they plug it into these models its gonna give them the best results in the best output and then its formatted correctly for their machine learning algorithms actually work and actually read the data and give them the output that they want and youll also be connecting a be testing now this looks very different in different industries but basically youre gonna be doing two independent tests getting two different results and seeing which one actually gives you better results in a nutshell that really is all AV testing is but it can get quite complicated and so Im not gonna go too much into that but lets look at the data anoles now as a data analyst youre gonna use your data to solve problems that your company has right now so instead of trying to find trends or opportunities for the future youre trying to answer questions that your company has now and have an immediate impact other responsibilities are also creating reports or creating dashboards and for creating reports a lot of times youll use either sequel or some cloud platform or any number of other tools that are out there for creating reports and then for dashboards you might be using something like power bi or tableau or maybe even Python it just depends on what your company is using Ive seen a very wide variety but creating reports and dashboards can be a large part of what a data analyst actually does and often theyll also help with gathering incremental data from different sources so you need the data you have to get it from somewhere so you may work with a client or an internal team to help them gather that data or get that data into your systems whether thats your warehouses are just your Seigle servers or whatever that is for your company but you have to be getting that data somewhere and using that data for these reports and for these dashboards so that may also be a part that youre doing now lets look at the qualifications for each of these positions and lets start out with the data scientist as a data scientist youre often going to need a masters degree or above that can be in anything from computer science econ mathematics physics it really depends on what industry youre going into and what they value but oftentimes those more stem backgrounds are really good for a data scientist now its not to say that you have to have a masters degree but oftentimes that is a prerequisite for most positions but there are some positions where theyre really just looking at experience and your skills to see if youre a good fit and they might take you if you only have a bachelors degree but again this is a prerequisite for a lot of positions that youll find on LinkedIn or lost or other job posting websites you need a masters degree just to meet the base requirements and for the data analysts are gonna need a bachelors or above from most positions and thats going to be in a lot of the same degree fields that a data scientist had which are computer science mathematics economics we dont have to have a bachelors degree or have a bachelors degree in those fields you can have no degree and have really good skills and work your way up and you can also have a degree thats completely unrelated but youve made the switch and it is absolutely possible to do that I will say that for qualifications the bar is much lower for a data analyst is a data scientist and you may have a lot better chance of getting your foot in the door as a data analyst than you would if youre trying to actually get a data scientist position right off the bat if you were like in this video be sure to LIKE and subscribe below and now lets look at these skills section so for a data scientist some of the skills that you might need are sequel R and Python and in Python theres a few libraries that really stand out which are pandas numpy scikit-learn and tensorflow then you have things like tableau power bi data visualization tools you may also be working with NLP which is natural language processing which could be structured or unstructured data you may be using apache spark jupiter notebooks pi charms some type of ide and then you may also be using some statistical tool which is SAS or SPSS or any number of other tools that are out there so for a data analyst you may need sequel or in Python and then some libraries for that are gonna be pandas and M PI and matte pot live youll also need a data visualization tool like tableau or power bi youll need to be doing data modeling also need a statistical tool like SAS or SPSS or many others youll be working in Excel a lot and then youll also probably work in some type of a cloud platform like AWS or Azure now before we get to salary we are looking at salary ranges these are gonna be specific answers for either your location or your industry so if you do want specific answers for either of those things I recommend doing your own research on those but lets get into it lets look at data scientists salaries so for an entry-level position youre looking at around 85 to 95 thousand for a mid-level youre looking at a hundred to 120,000 and then for a senior level position youre looking at somewhere around 120 to 150 thousand and for a data analyst for an entry-level position youre looking at around forty five to sixty thousand for mid-level 65 to 85 thousand for a senior level position around 85 to 110 thousand now looking at these salaries you might think well Alex Ill just go be a data scientist obviously they make a lot more money Ill just go do that but I want to urge you to really look at these positions and see which one fits your skill sets your education and the kind of work that you want to be doing because I will say that although there are a lot of similarities theres a lot of differences as well I think for a data scientist it takes someone whos very driven to get either a masters or a PhD in a specific degree really pursue machine learning and know how to use those models correctly although a lot of your time is gonna be data cleaning you have to know how to use the models and which models fit and best for your data but if you have those qualifications and you have those skills or you are actively looking to pursue those skills that might be the perfect career for you and it may be a very lucrative career for you especially if you get into the right industry now for a data analyst I think that a lot of people are gonna fit into this category instead of a data scientist category and I think this is for a few reasons one I think its a little bit easier to learn the skills that you need in order to become a data analyst and two since the qualifications are bachelors are above a lot more people are gonna be included or have the opportunity to become a data analyst overall it really is up to you and which one you prefer I think you should really look at yourself and see what kind of work you enjoy doing I think both of these careers are fantastic options long-term and I dont think these jobs are gonna be going away at all in the near future I think the popularity of these jobs are only gonna increase over the next 10 years so getting started now and knowing what you want to do and just going for it is really the best advice that I have so thats all I got thank you guys so much for watching if you like this video be sure to LIKE and subscribe below and Ill see you in the next video
