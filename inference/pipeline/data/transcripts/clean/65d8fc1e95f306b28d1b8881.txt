as NLP is a subfield of linguistics computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human natural languages the ultimate objective of NLP is to read decipher understand and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable most NLP techniques rely on machine learning to derive meaning from human languages NLP is the driving force behind the personal assistance word processors like Microsoft Word language translation applications and much more it is one of the biggest subfields of AI mainly because you use it every day with Siri Google Translate Microsoft Word etcetera but how does NLP work this human machine NLP interaction can be described in two typical steps at first NLP entails applying algorithms to identify and extract the natural language rules such that the unstructured language day 2 is converted into a form that computers can understand then when the text has been provided the computer will utilize algorithms to extract meaning associated with every sentence and collect the essential data from them lets see a simple example with those two steps between a machine and a human just like Siri or okay Google would using NLP at first a human talks to the machine then the machine captures the audio and the audio to text conversion takes place it then processed the texts data and convert it into an audio file the machine then responds to the human by playing the audio file sometimes the computer may fail to understand the meaning of a sentence well leading to obscure results for example when someone uses a sarcastic remark to pass information the machine may not interpret it well in short while humans can easily master a language the ambiguity and imprecise characteristics of the natural languages are what make NLP difficult for me to implement these challenges in natural language processing frequently involves speech recognition natural language understanding and natural language generation which we will see in the next videos subscribe to not miss any of those terms clearly explained [Music]
