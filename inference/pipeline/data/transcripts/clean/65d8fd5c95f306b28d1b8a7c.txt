introduction to database these lectures cover chapter one of our course sales book our main objective is to go through different types of databases and also database applications the basic definitions also database management functionalities we should also discuss about the main characteristics of database approach and also the advantages so we start with the types of databases and database application normally traditional applications will be numeric and textural databases where we store values and text messages but most recent or more recent applications are multimedia database where we can install media data such as graphics images also we have geographic information system biological and genome database thats mostly in a computational biology bioinformatics data warehouses mobile databases such as our smartphone or any mobile devices tablets etc also real-time and active databases such as a stock market and database system so a numeric and textual database system we see a database that provide numeric information such as statistics or demographic information its a numeric databases also traditional textual database interfaces allow users to search an index composed of exclusively of terms extracted from documents now a multimedia database is a collection of related for multimedia data so multimedia data can be images or media data types videos etc we also have a mobile databases which is in mobile computing devices such as smartphones and personal digital assistants also store and share data over a mobile network or a database which is actually stored by the mobile device this could be a list of contacts price information distance traveled or any other information we also have geographical information system which is a computer system for capturing storing checking and displaying data related to positions on our health surface now by relating similarly unrelated data gis can help individuals and organizations better understand spatial patterns and also relationships biological and genome databases can be again broadly classified into sequence structure and functional databases so nuclear acid and protein sequences are saw in a sequence databases for example a nucleotide for dna would be the ac and the four nucleotides also protein concepts protein sequence agtc for dna and then we also have the structure normally for protein structure databases to store a 3d structure of a protein or rna then functional data based on what we store the data but lets say the protein functions etc dna function etc now human genomic databases also are referred to as online repository of genomic variants mainly described for a single or more genes or specifically for a population or ethnic group aiming to facilitate diagnosis at dna level and also to correlate genomic variants with specific phenotypic patterns and clinical features a data warehouse normally is where companies or business organizations store historical data for so many years so most business organizations may have a regular database system for transaction or we say transactional database where they may have a policy that okay every month we may transfer our transaction database to our data warehouse so data warehouse we may have historical data for many years and these datas are very good for analytics such as using data mining algorithm or machine learning algorithm to find a knowledge from that database system so a data warehouse again is a type of data management system that is designed to enable and support business intelligence activities especially analytics so data warehouses are solely tended to perform queries and also analysis and often contain large amounts of historical data the data within a data warehouse is usually derived from a wide range of sources such as application log files transaction applications etc also data warehouse centralizes and consolidates large amount of data from multiple sources we also have the real-time database which is a database that uses a real-time processing to handle workloads whose state is constantly changing this differ from traditional databases containing persistent data mostly unaffected by time a very good example would be a stock market that changes very rapidly rapidly and dynamic in the real time the recent development is the social network the internet example facebook twitter linking and these organizations also have their own database system so social networks start capturing a lot of information about people and about communications among people posts twins photos videos and systems such as facebook twitter linking search engines such as google bin yahoo also collect their own representative web pages for searching purposes now new technologies are emerging from so-called known database software vendors to manage vast amount of data generated on the web and big data storage system involving large process of distributed computers and no sql system also a large amount of data now reset on the crowd which means it is a huge data data centers using thousands of machines again the future lectures we shall go through this concept especially the null sql now these are some of the basic definitions in database management system first we start with what is a database again its a collection of related data example will be a customer database system or patient database which means information about the patients or customers also what is the data data will be a known facts that can be recorded and have an implicit meaning example would be a patients last name or employee salary rate meaning what means some part of the real world about which data is stored in a database so example will be a student grade and transcript at a university then a database management system is the software or the application that we use to create or develop a database system and also manage and manipulate the data in a database system so a software package system to facilitate the creation and maintenance of computerized database a database system now will be the combination of a database software and the data itself and this is what discussed about database system how we can use the software to create our data what tools we can use in the software and how we can manage this data if stored in the database now the impact of databases and database technology in businesses for example banking insurance retail transportation health care manufacturer this business organizations all use databases because any business operation surely data will be generated and this data need to be stored somewhere we also have service industries such as financial real estate legal electronic commerce small businesses also generate data so they need database system to again store their data and manage it education resources for content and delivery these resources also are stored in the database system most recently again example facebook linking etc social network environment and scientific applications such as medicine and genetics personalized application based on smart mobile devices now to simplify database system environment normally we have three levels the the lower level is where our actual data is stored so here we see store data definition then the store database in the future we shall discuss about what is a mental data then we have the middle tab which will be the database manager software we use it to create our environment and we store the data we manage the data from the user can only interact with the system from the application programs or queries so we have database system database management system then theres physical storage so a typical database management system functionality can be defining a particular database in terms of its data types structures and constraints again our future lecture we may discuss this more detail also to construct or load the initial database content on a secondary storage medium also manipulating the database how to retrieve data using example query or generating reports also modifications inserting data deleting data or update data in the database system accessing the database through a web application also processing and sharing by a set of concurrent users and application programs yet keeping all data valid and consistent so again database technology make all this possible application activities against a database here we say applications interact with a database by generating queries queries that access different part of a data and formulate a result of a request a query normally will be a question that we ask the system for example we have a customer database system we can write a query that we need all customers that came from new york state or we need all the customers that spend more than 50 dollars which means we have to write a query to get a result we may have thousand customers maybe only five spend more than fifty dollars we dont want to go through the manually so using a query very quick also transactions that may read some data and update setting values or generate new data and store that in a database applications must not allow unauthorized users to access data so that means application must allow only authorized users to access data thats security and also application must keep up with changing user requirement against the database additional database management system functionality including protection or security measures to prevent unauthorized assets also active processing to take internal actions on data presentation and visualization of data maintenance of the database and associated programs over the lifetime of the database application also called a database or software or system application so in summary we went through different types of database the definition of database database applications and also the typical functionality of a database management system so again this is chapter one part one of our lectures in the future lectures we may go through detail about the few items we want here thank you for your time
