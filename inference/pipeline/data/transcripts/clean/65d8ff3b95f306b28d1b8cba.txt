 in most aspects of our lives. We actively use smartphones  both at work and at home. We use smartwatches  for fitness and health. We use interactive office equipment  for collaboration and many more things. My colleagues will give concrete examples - on concepts and prototypes  that we currently work on. Virtual and augmented reality have become  quite popular for entertainment. But before these become useful tools  in our everyday lives, there are still several hard problems  for us to solve. So we are designing novel 3D  interaction techniques and user interfaces that are ergonomic  and adjusted to the actual task. We also explore new approaches  for object tracking -  collaboration in virtual environments and interaction  with robots through augmented reality. Immersive technologies can thereby help us  acquire new knowledge and to work  more productively. In the future our computer interfaces  will be able to dynamically change between different shapes. Envision a world where flexible displays  are seamlessly blended into rooms and their furniture where users can change and adapt their physical work environment  as they shift between activities. We are exploring this future  by developing shape changing tabletops - that fold into different configurations while users are collaborating  and sharing information. Under the hood, all the devices in our environment  generate a vast amount of data. To make this data useful, to society  our research combines methods from machine  learning and artificial intelligence  with interactive data visualization. An outcome of this research  are fundamental contributions to the area of big data analytics  through progressive computation. But we also use that research  in real world scenarios, for example, for looking at how living patterns  have changed during the COVID 19 pandemic  through the lens of sensor data. As digital technologies  increasingly become part of our everyday lives - theres a need for everyone  to understand how they work and what are the implications for the way  we live. To foster such understanding, we conduct research  on educational learning tools. Letting children experiment  with these tools - they can learn, for instance,  about the importance  of training data in machine learning,  and how that data quality  and quantity influence the results. We are a diverse research team brought together with the desire  to actively shape the digital future. We do this through our research, teaching  and the user-centered design approach. And you are of course very welcome  to reach out to us to learn more.
