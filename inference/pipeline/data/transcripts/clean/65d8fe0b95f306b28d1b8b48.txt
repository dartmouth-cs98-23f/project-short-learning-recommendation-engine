same thing? Well, you may have seen these terms   used interchangeably, but if Im mining data from  a large dataset, am I performing data science or   am I performing data analytics? Or what if Im  trying to create a prediction of when my store   will sell out of our current inventory of  cantaloupes? Well, is that analytics or is   that science? Its worthwhile to understand the  difference to better comprehend what these two   fields can do, and also, if youre considering  a career in either field. After all, these are two   different jobs. Somebody who works in the field  of data science is known as a data scientist.   For data analytics, that role is called a data  analyst. Now, this is kind of a trick question   because we can classify everything-- data  mining, data forecasting and all the rest of   it --as simply data science. And thats because  data science is the overarching umbrella term   that covers tasks related to finding patterns in  large datasets, training machine learning models,   and deploying AI applications. Data analytics, it  could be argued, is one task that resides under   the data science umbrella. Its a specialization  of data science, and it focuses on querying,   interpreting and visualizing datasets. Data  science is iterative, meaning data scientists form   hypotheses and experiments to see if a desired  outcome can be achieved using available data.   And that is a process that is known as the data  science lifecycle, which usually follows seven   phases. So first is to identify a problem or an  opportunity. Then the next phase is data mining,   which is to extract data relevant to that problem  or opportunity from large datasets. Now that data   will likely consist of a bunch of redundancies  and errors, which is fixed in the next stage,   data cleaning. And then at that point, we move on  to data exploration analysis to try to make sense   of that data. Well then apply feature engineering  using domain knowledge to extract details from the   data. And predictive modeling comes next to use  the data to predict or forecast future outcomes   and behaviors. And then finally, we have data  visualization that represents the data points with   graphical tools such as charts and animations.  And so the lifecycle repeats. Now, the role of a   data scientist is an in-demand profession right  now. If thats something youre interested in,   youll want to develop deep skills in machine  learning and AI. Its helpful to be able to   write code in languages such as Python--also in R--  its another popular language for data science. And   you should have experience working with big data  platforms. So perhaps Hadoop or Apache Spark. And   its also very helpful to have database knowledge  and SQL. So thats data science. But what about   its specialization, data analytics? Well, the job  of a data analyst is to conceptualize a data set   as it currently exists. So we have some data  here and we need to do something with it. And   we need to be able to make decisions based on  this data. How do we conceptualize it? Well,   four ways. One is through predictive analytics,  which helps to identify trends, correlations and   causation within datasets like forecasting when  those cantaloupes would have all flown off the   shelves. Or, in health care, to forecast regions  which will experience a rise in flu cases. Theres   prescriptive analytics, and that predicts likely  outcomes and makes decision recommendations like   predicting when a tire will wear out and need  to be replaced. Theres diagnostic analytics   that helps pinpoint the reason an event occurred.  Manufacturers can analyze a failed component on an   assembly line and figure out the reason behind its  failure. And then there is descriptive analytics   which evaluates the qualities and quantities of  a data set. A content streaming provider might   use descriptive analytics to understand how many  subscribers its lost or how many its gained over   a given period of time and what content is being  watched. And while a data scientist is a clearly   defined and specialized role, virtually any  stakeholder can be a data analyst. For example,   business analysts can use BI dashboards to conduct  business analytics and visualize KPIs. But many   organizations do employ professional, dedicated  data analysts, responsible for data wrangling   and interpreting findings like why a companys  marketing campaign didnt meet expectations. If   you want to be a data analyst, it helps to have  both analytical and programming skills. So this   includes familiarity with databases. Also, youll  need to know about statistical analysis. And also   data visualization is another important skill.  So data analytics is often more focused on using   statistical tools and techniques to interpret  existing data and offer actionable insights.   Its usually less concerned with creating  new algorithms or models. Data science,   on the other hand, has a broader scope that can  involve complex machine learning algorithms, often   created from scratch. Data science focuses  on phases from data collection to predictive   modeling. Data analysis, on the other hand, is  more about answering specific questions with   that data. And if youve done both your  data science and data analytics right,   youll always be able to keep cantaloupes  and just about everything else in stock.
