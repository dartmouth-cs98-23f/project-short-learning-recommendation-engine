listen to me closely if you clicked on this video consider it a contract between you and me that youre going to watch this video in full and youre going to want actually going to need to do that because the data science job outlook is dramatically changing right now its changing very fast and its changing a lot so were going to need to know what to do here what do you do well Im going to talk about that in this video but firstly I want to explain that data science jobs are not close to dying okay theyre not getting automated were getting more and more data were getting more and more insights from this data if people are going to look at it you cant just get insights from a computer those are machine learning models you can build those but we still need to know what to do with them all of this stuff were going to need humans for them however the job outlook is changing a lot right now and in this video at the end Im going to say one massive piece of advice Youre Gonna Want To Know a skill that youre going to need to build so that you are able to set yourself apart from the competition and able to avoid the automation of Chad GPT well talk about that at the end but firstly you know data science jobs theyre there however exploratory data analysis is not quite what it used to be its a lot easier to actually get this stuff done I think its still very important to be able to understand python code to be able to understand the library so that youre able to do things and tweak the charge BT responses as you need to so its extremely important to do these things because everybodys going to be able to code now its not as hard as it used to be however if you know the skills you are going to be much better than the people that dont they might still be able to use chat gbt but theyre going to struggle so of course companies are going to want to beat the same people as they did before theyre going to want data scientists however it is going to be easier to fake being a data scientist right now because what is what has everybody been suggesting to get a job oh a little bit of credentials and then just Spam projects make really really good projects no its going to be a lot more about actually knowing the skills okay so youre going to need to take courses online to get an education or somewhere and then come back and build projects because anyone could build projects now like its so easy before what you had to do was to just grab a Blog and then fiddle with it and then youd probably get an error and then youd fight with it I know youve done this okay so oftentimes we give up from that jtbt is making it a lot easier just to build these projects online and so youre gonna need to have all the skills the software architecture skills the of course the the libraries and the Frameworks and the actual language itself but more about building full applications Chachi BT is great at building code it can you can iterate with it and build applications very very quickly however what it cannot do is piece things together okay it can build individual Lego blocks but it cannot build a Lego castle you need someone or company is going to need people that understand all of the Lego blocks what each of them do and how to put them together okay its going to be a lot more about actually putting things together and of course its still writing code Im not saying that youre not going to need to write code but its getting faster and companies are going to need less people to actually write this code because like if developers are just writing code so much faster than they used to be Im working on a startup right now youll see the results hopefully this year I really hope this year hopefully by the end of the summer but I am writing code extremely quickly right now in languages that I am learning at the same time like JavaScript I dont know very well but with Chad GPT Im writing JavaScript code and I am using it all the time so trust me coding is just easier than it used to be my God but anyways chatgpt is so so good at writing code in many areas and so its going to be a lot more about knowing these individual Lego pieces being able to put them together and 100 this is what you absolutely need to know is gcp AWS Azure building actual applications putting all the pieces together to build a final product because again data analysts data data exploratory data analysis simple uh data science stuff its still useful its still extremely useful and I Im not saying that its going away however its just easier youre still going to need to know all of these skills if youre a data scientist you absolutely should still know python all these visualization libraries SQL all the normal stuff like tensorflow Pi torch whatever for machine learning models however your actual job is getting easier in some ways with the you know traditional analytics is getting easier however its going to merge into building full applications okay Ive said this in previous videos it is more important than ever right now to learn all of this data science stuff and then learn how to build actual applications and you can do it in the reverse way if you want you can absolutely build applications and then you can learn data science theres still going to be a lot of roles in data science however theyre merging into doing multiple things at the same time using your analytics to build these applications okay now theres still going to be those base analytics roles where youre just doing simple visualizations and stuff and presenting them however its hard to say how many people theyre really going to need to do that because theyre just so efficient these days and more and more people are going to be able to do that so what youre going to need to do listen to me closely be really really really really really good at your job its not just learn some analytics make a Jupiter notebook and you can get a job anymore Im sorry you should still learn all of those skills and youre going to need them but build full applications learn Advanced machine learning architectures so that you can actually expand upon the companys skill set build their own Technologies out and not just be one of the many many people that are able to do these simple analytics you got it okay subscribe bye bye
