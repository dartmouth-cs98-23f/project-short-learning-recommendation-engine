for myself I remember as a child I used these punch cards to like reading cars and things like that my mom was a computer programmer analyst and this was an example of such a computer that my mom used to process payroll data coding was literally done by hand on sheets like these it was a physical endeavor and a manual process during this phase of computing the goal of HCI was simply just to get the data processed now there were three official invention three critical inventions that led this next phase of computing the transistor 2 integrated circuits and the microprocessor these inventions enabled computers these smaller to burn faster and more efficient than computers that were built with vacuum tubes and really began the trend towards the miniaturization that continues to this day just this past Tuesday IBM announced new chip thats like smaller than I the size of a grain of salt over there on the far right and the tiny computer is mounted onto a motherboard we have 64 motherboards with two tiny computers in the left picture and the fifth computer has the processing power of a typical personal computer made in the 90s like an x86 processor anyway these inventions drove the birth of the personal computer the first personal computer was introduced to 1925 by IBM and it featured a 16 line by 64 character display that ran a computer language called basic now command line interfaces where the primary means of interacting with computers first on terminals like this a deaf bt 101 personal computers Keynes running UNIX or ms-dos the interface would consist of a command-line shell which would accept commands as text input and then convert the commands into corresponding operating system functions the advances made in computing technology created an offer for people to interact with computers in a different way we moved away from physically manipulating bits to interact with computers in a digital space on screen the invention of the mouse by Doug Engelbart and the graphical user interface or GUI revolutionized HCI and it was really during this phase that the field was born the field of HCI early attempts at graphical user interfaces were skeuomorphic and literally tried to replicate the physical world even in its most inefficient ways the most successful style of interaction design has been what we refer to as wynt which stands for windows icons menus and pointer with interfaces are so ubiquitous that this is what comes to mind when we think of the term graphical user interface although not all gooeys are wind systems the language of HCI and a whimp world is direct manipulation complete with nouns represented by icons and verbs represented by menus or buttons and with a GUI and a mouse people can operate under a paradigm of hey you icon go here into that folder or ask the Macintosh computer which exemplified the ideal GUI launched in 1984 with principles that emphasize directness user control and real world metaphor now the goal of HCI this time was to leverage pre-existing paradigms of the physical world without taking it too far and make it user friendly the birth of the iPhone and Android based smartphones put the power of computing in everyones pocket by using our fingers instead of a mouse direct native manipulation is even more direct than with interface we swipe to scroll we literally drag objects by dragging our fingers its still direct manipulation but the language has evolved to meet the form and the capabilities of the computing device our early handheld computing devices were introduced before we had ubiquitous broadband so functionality at that time is typically into personal digital assistant features like calendaring note-taking contacts management and the internet is what really enabled smartphones to take off and be not just useful but extremely addictive and with the power of what once used to be a supercomputer now in the palm of your hand we enable people to access computing technology from anywhere now where as in the first phase of computing we were bringing the physical world into a digital space sensors enable us to use natural movement to bring a digital world into a physical space the Xbox Kinect mate playing video games of physical endeavor the Fitbit digitized our physical activity ring allows us to talk to visitors at our door even when were not at home and Nesta made our thermostats smarter by adapting to our usage patterns in the home I like to highlight a few more companies that are doing interesting work in this area particularly in health tech siren care has created smart socks that use temperature sensors to detect inflammation in real time for diabetics so diabetes patients are prone to foot swelling and that can lead to infection or amputation that the foot isnt checked conductive thread is woven into the fabric of the sock to detect where theres inflammation and all this information is uploaded to an app on your smartphone to alert you to an issue heres another company alivecor they offer a mobile fda-cleared EKG monitor targeted towards patients who have atrial fibrillation afib patients have an irregular and brown off and rapid heart rate that can increase their risk of stroke heart failure or other hurt related complications the lac courte offers two ways for people to monitor their heart cardio mobile which is an attachment to your phone and cardio watch which is a replacement for spam for your Apple watch so notification is sent to the user to record an EKG if the heart rate appears in consist with the users activity level now theoretically it could go further all the data is stored in the cloud and alivecor could mine all of the data to make predictions based on what they see for example if your EKG reading mimics the patterns in other patients hours before they had a heart attack a life poor could send you an alert and advise you to take necessary precautions to avoid you know in a minute heart attack so its computing devices move beyond as computing moves beyond devices with screens language of HCI similar via balls how do you define without a screen so as we bring the digital world into a physical space how do we deal with the ethical and privacy issues surrounding constant instrumentation and mass collection of personal data I wrote this talk before all the news came out of Cambridge of analytic oh I think its particularly timely and relevant as sensors become ubiquitous we increasingly track every aspect of our lives we may reach a point where computers know more about us than we know about ourselves so already Google and Facebook algorithms know exactly how you feel and countless other things that you may not even know Facebook only needs 10 likes from you to outperform predictions from work colleagues about your preferences personality and dispositions they need them only about 70 likes to outperform your friends 150 likes to outperform family members and 300 likes to outperform spouses so if you have clicked three hundred likes from your Facebook account Facebook can predict your opinions and desires better than your own life partners now imagine that Google or Facebook read every single email text message post we ever wrote to every photo we ever took and combine that with knowledge of our heart rate blood pressure hormone levels in real time as we move through everyday life they would be better equipped to tell us how to vote what mate to choose how to spend our time far beyond what we are consciously aware in the same way that we rely less on our action and navigation now that we have GPS you they decide stop listening to your feelings and start listening to these external algorithms instead this could lead to a scenario where algorithm these algorithms would be better equipped to vote on your behalf obviating the need for democratic elections right in China the government is testing a new way of social control that brings citizens based on their social and financial behavior the Social Credit system would use facial recognition to evaluate individuals day to day behavior and generate a credit score for each person so minor violations like jaywalking or jumping the trampled ticket line could decrease ones social credit in the system thereby affecting their ability to get a loan or travel abroad now strict privacy laws in the u.s. may protect us from this black mirror-like inspired in future but commerce leaf they may hinder us from making the best predictions for customers when it comes to making decisions around our health care based on a genetic database or Big Data since this is all based on statistics the size of a companys database is key to making accurate prediction and Chinese disregard for privacy may actually give them an advantage in the area of health and medicine over the u.s. so in 2011 Apple rolled out Siri Google now launched in 2012 marking the beginning of a new phase where an absolutist natural language to answer peoples questions we now have fast enough computers and dated where we can actually train large neural networks and as we train them with more and more data that performance improves accordingly in 2015 a 31 year old man a Roman Maz Renko died while crossing streets in Moscow his death was a devastating loss for his best friend Jenny CUDA at the time couldnt have been building a messenger bot that could do things like make restaurant reservations and she fed her text messages with mahzarin go into her neural network and created a bot in his likeness and as a memorial to mother encode could have replicated his personality and could talk to him again via chat bot and so the replica was born the chat bot uses a deep learning model which learns how to mimic how humans speak in order to simulate conversations the version of replica that exists today is used by people who seek emotional support its not a substitute for Siri or Alexa or Google assistant people are using replicas to talk about their feelings AI researchers and roboticists are testing the limits of how much machines can learn to mimic and respond to human emotion these are the big questions the world of HCI needs to answer now how do you get a machine to think and act like a human what does it mean to be humans or organisms just algorithms and is life really just about data processing processing is consciousness valuable and what about love or human connection what kinds of relationships do we want to have with machines are they our friend assistant 19e law enforcer pleasure partner what is the role of the machine and what is the role of the humans and machines are increasingly trained to think and act like humans their ability surpass ours and many of the startups that I work with are using human users to train the machine learning algorithms so that machines can do the same work at a much faster much larger scale and as this too comes realized this technology becomes realized the goal of HCI is no longer a view a goal unto itself but a goal to be moved in fact one of the executives that I worked with boldly proposed a quarterly no UI goal where the goal would be to launch at least one feature per quarter that requires no human user but what happens when theres so much automation that humans have no role in decision-making when our lives are at stake and weve all heard about the way mail access sorry that uber accident that happened to imagine youre writing in a self-driving car and because theres still some cars on the road that are not autonomous theres a scenario where your car could collide with another because its not coordinating with the car now should your vehicle be programmed to save the passengers life which is you or you know what what if the car is about to hit a busload of kids and there many more lives at stake okay or what if that busload of people is filled the children what if the other victim is wealthier than you or younger than you or healthier than you and which lies should our machines optimize for and how do you value a life machine values reflect human values and a human centered approach to AI means that our machines should be partners in securing our well-being and how we do that and what we optimize more is our responsibility as designers of technology now augmented and virtual reality systems today are still mostly concert ties much in the same way that the personal computer was p32 toy in the 70s before useful software was made right now AR is mostly used for specialized applications like flying a drone or for business use such as on factory floors or in the operating room theres an increasing consensus that artificial reality will be or augmented reality will be the new platform in computing in these contexts of use the goal of HDI is to connect the physical world with the virtual world for example how my data on-demand overlaid with the physical world help people do their jobs more effectively or efficiently how might be systems be designed so that they can be used in a hands-free environment now the software for AR and VR systems continue to evolve and thus the language for interacting with them continues to evolve and vary but they all leverage natural human movement mediating mediated by some kind of display whether its your retina or screen or sensors now whereas AR aims to connect the physical world with the virtual world VR aims to bring humans into the virtual world virtual reality stands to occupy people time and attention either as entertainment or as an escape from reality or both and the world where robots have taken over most jobs virtual world may be the place where people seek a sense of meaning and purpose for their lives now no other invention has the potential to radically change human-computer interaction than brain computer interfaces and today all the interaction with a machine or computer is done through a device between you and the technology whether thats a mouse a keyboard a joystick a screen or a sensor by removing that device and directly decoding the photos from our brains to the devices we break through to a whole new kind of interaction between humans and machines theres one company called control labs that is doing just that the first thing that they want to fix is the experience of texting on phones imagine not needing a keyboard to enter text into a mobile device what if we could send a message to our loved ones from our pockets with our hands still in our pockets okay theres literally no interaction with a machine today neither with the phone or the computer or any kind of robot that this technology doesnt ultimately turn upside down we often engage in research around human augmentation with the noble goal of curing disease or helping the disabled but inevitably groundbreaking inventions are often used to upgrade normal healthy humans as well imagine the future humans may enjoy upgraded physical and mental abilities that will enable us to hold our own against the most sophisticated non just out algorithms with the help of genetic engineering nanotechnology and brain computer interfaces we may reach the variant of superhumans made available only to a select few namely those who are wealthy enough to who can afford it and this it results in the creation of a new superhuman caste what then becomes of our society and we have a caste of people who are engineered to be superior to normal human how will that change the way we perceive and value human life now in the early days of human-computer interaction students like myself studied human cognition and perception which allowed us to make technology useful and usable we could not have imagined that a service for sharing videos would be used to radicalize people or that the very social media platforms used to move the middle-east towards democracy would be used to disrupt the u.s. democratic process in the 2016 election the future languages of HDI need to be informed by ethics politics art and an understanding of human consciousness who decides how technology evolves and how it should be directed were all collectively designers of our relationship to technology educators policymakers philosophers and that those journalists executives employees we all play a role in shaping the discourse and public opinion around our relationship to technology and especially creatives whether youre designers filmmakers actors or artists they have the skills to help imagine the future realities and help them make them tangible to us so that we understand the potential consequences of our decisions before they materialize and as consumers in a capitalist society we help decide whats worth using whats worth our time and attention we all own that [Applause]
