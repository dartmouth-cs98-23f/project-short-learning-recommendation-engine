i need data visualization to become a data scientist not to spoil things too early but the answer is a resounding yes in this video i talk through why dataviz is important for the data science process and how you can leverage it to your advantage in your studies your projects and on your job weve all heard the saying that a picture is worth a thousand words its cliche but theres immense truth to this statement in data science i like to say that one graph is worth a thousand tables when exploring data data visualization allows us to understand spatial relationships between variables we can also understand magnitude and time at least for me looking at tabular data even central tendency statistics tells only part of the story the first real value i find in data visualization is for getting to know our data set and for framing our analysis with data visualization you can immediately get an understanding of the distribution of the data correlations between variables and the trends in the data over time in this sense creating visuals saves us time and adds to our ability to frame the problem at hand the visual part of our brain has enormous processing power and that helps us to make sense of the massive volumes of information that we see i often find that when i look at data in tabular form it looks fine but once i graph it something immediately looks off we can easily notice small differences in graphs that might not have been obvious in these other data formats so maybe youre a machine learning engineer you arent doing much exploratory analysis is data visualization still useful to you again my answer is yes while your visuals might serve a different purpose theyre still unbelievably valuable to your role when building models we need a way to evaluate them if were comparing different models it also makes sense to compare performance over time the best way to convey information like this is usually visually you often see graphs of roc auc curves residual plots and future importance again these are far easier for us to digest than the raw data itself if you have to explain your model to someone else these visuals can also be extremely handy this brings us to the third value of data visualization sometimes data scientists are making recommendations and other times theyre creating tools for business stakeholders to use for better decision making some may argue that this would fall under the data analyst work as well i personally love the idea that i can make powerful data analysis accessible to people that arent quite technical through the things that i build with the right tools data visualization allows almost anyone to generate valuable insight from a data set as it so happens one of those incredible tools atoti is the sponsor of this video a toti is a python library that you can use to quickly build bi analytics dashboards on top of any data source this only takes a few lines of code and can be done directly in a jupyter notebook what i love about this specific platform is that it allows you to collaborate with your not as technical peers through their unique interface with a tote you can bring to life your data visualizations your what-if analyses your simulations and your multi-dimensional analysis ototi just released version 0.6.0 and i highly recommend you install it to check it out yourself like all of the modules and tools that i have as sponsors atoti has a community edition that is completely free to use often you need to present your findings to business stakeholders we sometimes forget that these people are not data scientists themselves we can drone on and on about the specifics of our models and their performance but again often its better to show rather than tell dataviz can be extremely effective for conveying complicated information in a digestible way just like how visualization can help us to make sense of our own data it can help others to make sense of our findings too i have a rule of thumb that if im presenting to anyone i have at least one visual ready to help me illustrate my point when i started doing this the effectiveness of my interactions they went through the roof another thing that people dont think about is the virality of a good database if you share a graph or a dashboard its really easy for someone else to forward it along you can begin to get more buy in on your ideas if theyre clearly communicated and they can spread like wildfire across your company or even your friend group a great example of this is the data is beautiful subreddit people just love to look at and share compelling visuals i think it gets overlooked quite frequently but our job as data scientists is to drive change in an organization its to build a new model or to make a recommendation that inspires action this is the last aspect of dataviz that i want to highlight in this video if youre in a meeting and you show a great data visualization its often very clear what the next step should be visuals are intended to illustrate what might be the right course of action ive been in so many meetings where people were arguing about what to do and then when you put a slide on the screen the decision becomes immediately obvious to everyone i kind of look at a great visualization a bit like a superpower and as we know superpowers can be used for good or for evil since dataviz can be used to powerfully drive decision making we really have to be careful that were not massaging the data to lobby for something that we personally want i hope this video helped you to better understand how data visualization can help you as a data scientist or an aspiring data scientist something that i wanted to end on is that theres a lot made of soft skills and communication skills in this space i think those are integrally important but compelling data visual skills can also help to complement those for people that might be less comfortable sharing in front of a group special thanks to ototi for supporting the channel and to you for watching this video until next time good luck on your data science journey [Music]
