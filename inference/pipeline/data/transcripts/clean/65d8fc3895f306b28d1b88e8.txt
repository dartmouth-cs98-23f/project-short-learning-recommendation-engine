tester or quality assurance analyst does you first need to understand the process by which the software is conceptualized developed and maintained this process is known as software development lifecycle or the sdlc there are seven key points to understanding the software development life cycle phase one planning phase two requirement analysis phase three design phase four implementation and coding phase five testing phase 6 deployment and phase 7 maintenance [Music] so it all starts with this guy the customer hes the guy that has the business idea for our invoice application and the money to get it started hes going to reach out to multiple different tech companies until he finds one that he likes finally hes going to meet our companys product owner or our project manager theyre going to discuss terms of their agreement sign a deal and accept the project this will move us into the next phase planning the requirements together the customer and the product owner will outline the requirements of the application lets imagine that the requirements that theyve both agreed upon are as follows one user registration two login three log out four the dashboard landing page and so on and so forth throughout this course well be running multiple iterations of the sdlc to which new requirements and new features will be added now that we have the outlined requirements lets take them and move on to the requirement analysis phase heres our team operations developers product owners and testers well all meet up at an office for a few hours and define each outlined requirement and give more planning details lets start with requirement number one user registration well need a username input field a password field a check box to accept the terms and conditions a submit button and the ability to save the user into our database then well move to requirement number two the login well need a login page to allow returning users to log back into our system for this we need another username input field a password field along with another submit button from this well need to read the users information out of the database and log them into our system requirement number three will require a logout button usually located around the same area where the user was logging in from when they press the logout button it should clear their session out of the browser to prevent other people from returning and logging back into their account finally requirement number four the dashboard this will essentially be the home page of our application after a new user is registered they should be redirected to the dashboard also when the user logs in with the returning account they should be redirected to the dashboard for our first sdlc i will keep the requirements easy in upcoming videos well dive further in with much harder customer requirements once all of the requirements have been analyzed by the team and defined the product owner will take all the defined requirements and create tickets in a project management system from here well move into the design phase of the sdlc the design phase takes all the requirements and starts to plan the product the design phase may include the business rules the user interface layouts color schemes what programming languages to use frameworks system server design database relationships architect of the application mobile aspects supported browsers and much more next well discuss the implementation and the coding of the application the implementation and coding phase is where everything starts to become fun the operations team will set up the physical hardware for the servers the developers will start writing the code the designers will continue planning the user interface and the testers will analyze the requirements and start building test cases for their test plans even in this stage testers are incredibly valuable they start to imagine the usability of the application and see how everything flows together sometimes while writing test cases they can discover things dont make sense and help redesign fundamental flaws in the early stages of the application next up well be discussing one of the most important phases which is the testing phase so why is the testing phase so important imagine that the developer has finished coding some of our new features in our requirements we found that when the user logs out that its not actually clearing the session in the browser and that another person can walk up to their computer click the login button or click the refresh on the page and they gain access to their account get access to all of their money and start making payments on various things theyd be huge and expensive terrible bug that would get released if we didnt have testers to test these types of things beforehand so what does a tester actually do during the testing phase [Music] now that we have the servers all set up and the database is set up developers have finished coding theyve given us an application an actual website that we can log into now now we can start testing and executing our test cases from the test plans that weve created validate that all of the requirements have been met make sure all the functionality is working as expected find as many bugs as we possibly can which could be color scheme is incorrect or theres a user interface bug somewhere the critical issue people not being able to log out maybe the users cant even register theres so many mistakes that developer can make and do make frequently so as were testing we start to find bugs and what well do is well report them into a bug tracking system which is then assigned to a developer theyll go in and theyll fix the bug fix the issue and assign it back to us this is called a bug of life cycle you may have noticed that ive mentioned test cases test plans and bugs in the upcoming videos well go into the bug life cycle iterating with developers and how to write test plans and test cases up next well talk about the deployment phase the deployment phase the operations team will end up mirroring the staging or development environment systems that weve been testing in and get them ready for production meaning that theyll install new hardware brand new servers have everything scalable for production this includes setting up the links setting up the databases for real users syncing up with the development teams and release managers once theyve completed all of these tasks our application will go live to real users this brings us to the final phase of the sdlc maintenance so imagine that weve released and our application became so successful were just getting millions of users logging in and registering and using this application so we need to maintain the servers in the environment they need to monitor the load the stress everything coming on the servers by so many users logging in and using it it doesnt bring down the system maybe we need to make larger servers larger databases maybe we need to get faster computers theres a lot of stuff that goes under in the maintenance phase there will be bugs found in production its called production support frequently users will email with their issues and you can stop and investigate what theyre complaining about or what their issue is figure it out write up a bug get it resolved and do another deployment to production with issues fixed so to summarize weve discussed planning requirement analysis design implementation and coding testing deployment and maintenance all right awesome that wraps up the video on the sdlc one last thing to say is once were in the maintenance phase new features will come through new requirements will come through and well restart the whole process again and be able to get new stuff added into our existing application [Music]
