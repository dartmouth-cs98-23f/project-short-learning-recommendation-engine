learncomputerscienceonline.com and in this video we are going to discuss what is instruction set architecture the instruction set architecture abbreviated as isa and it is a part of the processor architecture the instruction set architecture basically works as an interface between the hardware and the software in simple words the instruction set architecture is defined as the entire group of commands that the processor can perform to execute the program instructions every processor design is based on one specific instruction set architecture the instruction set architecture only defines the operational capacity of the processor in terms of set of commands that the processor can decode and execute for example the intel 8085 instruction set architecture consists of total 246 operation codes and 74 instructions let us now talk about how instruction set architecture is implemented into the processor design the processor architecture at the hardware level is also referred to as microarchitecture the term micro architecture is defined as the actual hardware implementation of the instruction set architecture in other words the micro architecture is the hardware circuitry of the processor chip that implements one particular instruction set architecture the instruction set architecture does not specify the actual implementation details of the instruction set architecture and therefore the chip manufacturing brand can decide how to implement the instruction set architecture into the processor micro architecture design and for this reason the two different processor brands that are based on the same instruction set architecture can have different implementation into the processor micro architecture all right so far we have defined and understood the concept of the instruction set architecture and how it is implemented into the processor micro architecture let us now briefly discuss some other important fundamental concepts related to the processor architecture and its correlation with the instruction set architecture the instruction format is another important design concept that is part of the processor architecture the computer program consists of set of instructions which directs the cpu to perform some specific operations however we all understand that the computer can execute only low-level machine instructions in the binary format and therefore all high-level programs are first compiled with the help of a special software called the compiler the compiler translates the high-level program instructions into the low-level machine instructions in the binary format the instruction format basically defines the layout of the machine instruction in terms of operation code operand and the addressing mode the instruction format supported by the processor depends upon the instruction set architecture of the processor and therefore the processor can support the instruction formats that are compatible with its instruction set architecture let us summarize what is instruction set architecture the instruction set architecture abbreviated as isa as a part of the processor architecture in simple words the instruction set architecture is defined as the entire group of commands that the processor can perform to execute the program instructions all right so that brings to the end of this tutorial on what is instruction set architecture in this tutorial we have discussed in detail some important fundamental concepts related to the instruction set architecture if you have liked this video then please give us a thumbs up and consider subscribing to this channel thanks for watching and i will see you soon with another interesting computer science tutorial [Music] you
