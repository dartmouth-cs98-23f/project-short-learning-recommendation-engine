 In this video I am going to explain the difference between  Risk and Cisc which is a very important topic  From your competitive exams point of view  Even it is very important for college and university level exams  So guys like the video quickly and subscribe the channel  If you havent done it yet and if you have done it  Then you can share it with other devices  Subscribers are very important  So as you know that the maximum syllabus  of computer organization and architecture  We have completed the maximum syllabus on our channel  You will get all the videos in the playlist  I am covering the remaining 2-3 topics  So that you can prepare the entire playlist,  the entire syllabus in that playlist  So if we talk about cisc and Risk  So the categorization we have done  On what basis is it done based on an instruction set  Means how many number of instructions we have to put  So what is the meaning of complex instruction set  Why we made the system complex  Because number of instructions are large  And if we talk about it, what is the meaning of reduced instruction set  Number of instructions are less  The most important difference is this  Number of instructions are large  What is the number of instructions, I have less  Now here on the basis of that only  the other differences are being made  Then if we talk here  Variable length instruction format  Means the instructions we are using in this  Is 16 bit, 32 bit, 64 bit  Means it is not of one size  We have kept instructions of different sizes  But here I have fixed length instruction format  Means I am using 32 bit instruction format  So in that only my opcode, operand,  whatever field I am keeping for instruction  I am doing fixed format  So this point gives benefit to whom  It gives benefit to program counter  Because program counter knows that instruction start from here  And next instruction starts from here  End is here, from that next starts from here  Here it is a little difficult, why  Because if one instruction is of 1 byte  It is of 2 byte, 4 byte, 8 byte  So according to that program counter has  to contain address of next available instruction  So this point is a little bit  For that problem can not be called a problem  Means this point is a little bit difficult  according to program counter  But this is its easiness, thats it  You can write no to problem or that  Then if we talk about large number of addressing modes  Here it supports large number of addressing modes  What is large number? Means all  your 8-9 addressing modes have variations  What is supporting all of them?  Few number of addressing modes  Maximum we have 4 addressing modes here  And here I have so many addressing modes  What problem can come?  Or what you can say is important point  If you are asked in exam  Then you have to mention in the instruction  Which addressing mode is there, where is your operand  So this thing you have to mention separately here  Because number of addressing mode is supporting more  Number of addressing mode is supporting less  Thats why it works properly in fixed length  Then if we talk about cost  Cost is high, more powerful  Simple reason you know is number of instruction set is large  Number of instruction set large means  That if you have to do any work, division, multiplication  You have to check any bit, if you have to check anything  You will get maximum instructions in this  But here you will not get maximum instructions  Yes, you can use available instructions  And make complex instructions  But by default you are getting  Easy instructions or less number of instructions  You can use them multiple times and make it as a complex  But here you will get complex by default  On hardware obviously  If you want to get more number of instructions  Then hardware should be more available  Now lets say you have to do addition, subtraction  You have to do multiplication, division  So hardware should support you properly  You should have more additional functionality in hardware  Thats why it will be costly but powerful  What is here?  Lets say you have only addition and subtraction  If you dont want multiplication, what can you do?  To do multiplication  You can get addition multiple times  So what does it mean?  It easily provides you all the instructions  But if hardware cost will be more  Thats why overall cost will increase  And overall cost will be less  Then if we talk about several cycle instructions  Means instructions are not necessary  That work will be completed in one cycle  You can also take multiple cycles  The CPI value is a bit here  Thats why it is a bit messy, it is too much  But here we try to keep CPI 1 using the pipeline  Because instruction is complete in single cycle  Then manipulation directly in the memory  Here your instructions are mostly memory to memory  Means whatever changes we are manipulating in memory  We are doing it directly in RAM  Here we are using registers  Here we are using register to register instructions more  Although load and store will be used by default  Because you will load data from memory  And you will store the final result  So here load and store is mainly used  Related to memory  But here the proper utilization of memory is there  Most of the work we are performing in memory  Then this micro programmed control unit is based  And this is hardwired control unit based  Control unit that generates signals  If you want to fetch, decode, execute any instruction  All this work is to generate signals of control unit  So this is micro programmed based  In which we can make changes  But this is hardwired  Fixed kind of environment  These are some examples that you can note  No need to remember  But mainly you can note some examples  I have written the popular architecture here  Like this Fugaku  Actually in 2020  Supercomputer  This is the example of supercomputer  So it also uses RISC system  I am finally summarizing this with a small example  So that you can get clear from the example  Lets say this is my RAM  Register set and this is my execution unit  Now see in RAM lets say my location is 2 by 2  In 2 by 2 lets say my number of rows is 4  So in 2nd row in 2nd column there is X  In 3rd row in 3rd column there is Y  Just for example I am taking  Now see what I have to do in CISC  In CISC directly use MULT instruction  What is there in 2 column 2  X is there, so take X  In column 3 what is there in 3 column 3  Y is there, so take Y  So it has to complete in one instruction  And it means in a way X is equal to X into Y  Means whatever location you read in it, take it  And directly multiply in memory  And store in the same location of memory  So when you use this instruction  Or you can say lets say you are using this code  So in assembly code, machine code  What is the number of micro instructions to do?  To do less, why?  Because this format which is more  You can say the instructions are compatible in a way  So thats why it has to produce less number of micro operations  See here we are doing the same work  First of all what will have to be done  Whatever data is in this location,  it has to be brought in register  Loaded, then loaded the one in the other location  Then what we used Prode  What we did in registers  Produced A and B  And finally we stored the same value again in 2x2 location  So we are doing this whole work in 4 instructions  This is done in 1 micro instructions  So somewhere memory utilization is more here  But if we talk about todays time  RAM has become very cheap  As compared to the last 10, 20, 30 years  So thats why this system is more popular than this  So these small examples as much as you have told  These points are more than sufficient  For your college, university exam as well as competitive exam  Thank you.
