Quantum job again and this time I have invited Abby hello to help me find a job uh last time when we were looking for Quantum jobs Nick and I were mostly looking for Quantum engineering Quantum Hardware focused roles because thats what our background and expertise is in but we thought it might be helpful to share some typical software engineering type jobs with you this time among others as well uh so why dont we get started lets go all right so this is the first job that Abby has selected for us to review uh the title is software engineer Quantum error correction this is interesting already from like the title first of all I very rarely see software engineering job titles that include the word Quantum to begin with but now specifically here theyre mentioning Quantum error correction so thats already like another like a subset of even just Quantum software engineering so that makes me I guess curious to see what this post is going to be about and its kind of interesting to see how error correction as a field is progressing to the point where theyre hiring you know actual software people to kind of join in with that kind of area of research so lets see what experience I would need a bachelors degree or equivalent practical experience practical experience again this is interesting because the Trap that I see a lot of employers falling into for software roles is theyll be very specific onl like you must have a bachelors degree in computer science which you know when youre in a already quite a niche if just generally hiring software developers with that kind of background is sometimes hard you get a lot of software people that are coming from less traditional academic backgrounds into software and then especially in a field like Quantum which is even more Niche youre not always guaranteeing that the people applying to your jobs will have the same kind of cookie cutter degree background you also need 5 years of experience with soft Ware development in C++ and python those are the pretty standard languages I would say for the quantum engineering Fields it particularly calls out data structures and algorithms not surprising that thats thats always telling to me when I see that because that means that I youre probably going to get the kind of Infamous uh software engineering type of interview where that means that like this employer will probably probably be asking you to like know how to do a bin research or like Le code Type problems leak code Type problems like you need to be on it with those data structures and those algorithms so yeah if you see the word data structure as an algorithms in a software engineering job post you got to be kind of like doing those leak code problems every day making sure that you can kind of talk about that even if practically you dont use them very much in your day-to-day you kind of have to prove you have that Baseline level of knowledge 3 years of experience testing maintaining launching software products one year with design or ar architecture and then experience with HPC which is high performance Computing real-time operating systems chronal driver development concurrency code development systems programming is that pretty typical stuff yeah I would say this is pretty typical for like a kind of mid to senior level kind of software um kind of job description and I think that you can definitely tell that this is not an entry level position also by looking at the preferred qualifications it says it prefers somebody with a higher level technical degree a Masters or a PhD and one year of experience in a technical leadership role so those of both of those say to me were looking for a mid to senior level software engineer and I think maybe whats interesting to point out too maybe people dont always know this but theres a w wide range of bands or levels that fall within mid to senior level software engineering jobs and usually when youre interviewing figuring out what band or level to hire you at is part of the interview process so they might say were looking to hire somebody for this role thats in a range of levels from like 3 to 5 or something like that and theyre fine with anybody in that range but what you actually will get hired at um is very important and so you have to negotiate that as part of your interview process I think you can also tell a little bit from like the salary range that I think they have included that here they give you quite a broad range in the salary so probably where you fit on that Spectrum will translate to your level of experience so if a tech lead was applying for this job they would probably be more eligible for the top range of that salary if youre not a tech lead if you have less experience youll probably be more likely to get the kind of the lower end of this range um but also good that theyre publishing their um their salary ranges that is we love salary transparency thats great so other preferred qualifications um experience developing accessible technology ooh thats Ive never seen that before so I what Im interpreting this is anytime youre going to be doing some kind of user-facing um software development so particularly if youre building websites or platforms that have kind of the general public interacting with them you kind of should be thinking about accessibility so thats how um easy it is for people to use your product but um theres this idea of Designing Technologies with an accessibility mindset from the get-go because even though you are kind of um addressing like a potentially Niche area of users the benefits that come actually can affect a very wide range of users the other preferred qualifications are experience interfacing with hardware fpga systems experience with automation monitoring or release management pretty typical stuff right yeah so thats probably stuff like cicd pipelines like logging um pushing out software releases things like that yeah and then the last one is knowledge of quantum Computing Andor error correction I like how thats put on like the preferred I know thats kind of funny because I feel like error correction at least to me is one of those things where its so Technical and theres so much literature that unless youre already actively working in the field and Publishing in the field it would be pretty hard to jump into a role like this I dont know if Im qualified for this role but uh I think this is a perfectly good post I think that this would be you know probably a great job hopefully they can find somebody because like you said its pretty specific all right next we have a Quantum client delivery lead what does the title tell us already Im going to be working with clients if I get this role and Im some type of lead thats also kind of what I what I get oh and were doing something Quantum related oh good what qualifications do I need to have strong client delivery engagement and relationship management skills and experience okay that means you need to have a proven track record of making your clients like you three years of experience in leading successful delivery engagements project management and client relationship management basically what I gather from this role is its not entry level this I would say is solidly mid um but they need basically people who understand what Quantum Computing is you cant come in totally blind to the technology and they need somebody who has good interpersonal relationship skills somebody whos going to be very organized somebody whos going to be able to work with clients but talk to them about technical Concepts but maybe not at um you know a super detailed technical level like it says here somebody whos more on the Enterprise or seite level which means an executive whos sort of further removed from being an individual contributor and like building the software or the technology themselves but they still need to have a really good grasp of where its going yeah it definitely seems like quite a broad audience that this person would have to be kind of of interacting with this would be a great role for somebody whos an excellent science Communicator I cannot emphasize enough how organized you have to be for these types of roles yeah super organized you have to be pretty fluent in product and project management software you have to know how to use them like the back of your hand um you have to be very organized and often this involves bothering people and telling them to follow up with you and give you the information or the content that you asked for weeks ago that they were supposed to have delivered by a specific date so a lot of this is also stakeholder management as well achieve a high NPS promoter score of nine or 10 in the client engagements that you lead now that one that is helpful that is helpful but I dont think I think if this has an acronym and I hate acronyms you should not use acronyms in a job posing at least without defining them oh also they say NPS which stands for net promoter score promoter score so theyre saying NPS promoter score so net promoter score promoter score like when people say ATM machines right it doesnt make sense grammar aside at least thats something very tangible so its basically just a satisfaction rating that your clients give you I think you know at the end of the year in terms of How likely they are to you know keep working with you and to recommend you to other clients as well cool sounds good uh next job okay we have another software job quantum software systems architect SL engineer youre going to be typing out a computer lot but it says roles and responsibilities extensive experience with software design for Hardware control and effective at developing close working relationships with collaborators I feel like this is like so vague oh wait but they do break it down into like minimum and preferred so these I guess are just the this is also not a role or responsibility so that bullet point extensive experience with software design is not a responsibility this looks like a very like last minute cut and paste job description but thats okay so minimum qualifications typically requires a minimum of 5 years of related experience with a bachelors degree or 3 years at a masters degree or a PhD with no experience okay again like pretty flexible in terms of like if you have a more advanced academic background theyll be willing to look for less time of like working experience but if the highest level of academic education you have as a bachelors degree then youll be expected to demonstrate a longer period of um relevant work experience which I think is fair and I think maybe something to point out because I didnt know this when I was applying to jobs straight out of my PhD the experience that you have when youre doing your PhD counts towards work experience I didnt know that for some reason and when I was graduating people were saying like you know how many years of work experience you have with python in my head I would think zero even though I knew Somey being a student right but I was technically a student but thats not right thats not what theyre looking for the correct answer is five or six or you know however long you had been using python at in graduate school and then it says experience in Python software development signal generators lasers electrooptic modulators single Photon counting modules and spatial light I dont know what that has to do with python software development this is the kind of program that I did when I was in graduate school is I used python to control all of the room temperature Electronics and boxes basically in the lab and so I had to learn how to interface and write like drivers and different modules so that I could like basically control all of the the control Electronics from my laptop and I do view that as like a very specific type of programming actually because like that is what I have the most experience in but when it comes to stuff like data structures and algorithms and leak code Im pretty useless because I pretty much only know how to program hardware and boes so I dont know theyre very different types of programming okay so this is kind of interesting to compare to like the first one that we looked at which was definitely earring more towards like a software developer who can kind of muddle their way through the physics stuff whereas this kind of role is someone that like know like having that Hardware experience is crucial but if youve like got that python software skills like thats you know great too the next one is also kind of interesting desire and ability to work on system level CAD modeling have you ever done CAD modeling like a lot of like moving pictures around on a gooey um but Im surprised to see it in a job posting like this actually does it have any relevance to building quantum computers I dont know sure yeah it does um but I guess I wouldnt think of it as a software engineering role to me thats more of like something that a hardware engineer does I like how specifically they put desire and ability to work on system level CAD modeling I dont know if that says something about how enjoy desire to work on CAD systems um so even if youre great at it if you do not want be doing this every single day youre not getting that job okay fair enough preferred qualifications background in CAD modeling I feel like that would be maybe a little bit more hard to find for a software engineer but totally possible and then the last one is software experience for Quantum control its interesting that the the CAD stuff is something that I think they realize that maybe its a hard skill to find plus everything else so theyre willing to hire someone without significant experience in that area but it would be a plus if you did have experience there and crucially it sounds like that is something that you will have to do as part of the job so you should be willing to work on that and even if you dont have experience with it you should be willing to learn it MH next oo okay I have no idea what the heck this is a Quantum treasure y consultant this looks fun just like from the name I would apply to senior level role so you have to have many years of doing Quantum treasury consultancy Abby skills required Quantum Financial modeling develop and Implement Quantum algorithms and model models to simulate complex Financial scenarios including cash flow forecasting risk assessment portfolio optimization liquidity these are all things for sure that quantum computers could maybe do one day these are Im at least happy to see listing very specific types of financial applications that I know people are working on in the field so theyve done their homework they understand that Quantum Computing doesnt apply to everything it could apply to these specific things however it is you know further down the the line in terms of how soon this is going to be implemented I think that Quantum Financial algorithms definitely require better Hardware in order to actually be implemented so I think that this impl them but you wouldnt get any useful results right thats what we mean like I certainly wouldnt put my 401k in this Quantum Financial modeling system yet and I think there would be needing to see a little bit more proof of concept here treasury strategy optimization I dont even know what this means okay so Im assuming there is an area of finance that is called Treasury and theyre looking like thats like seems to be like a classical Financial Field and they want to look for ways to apply Quantum Computing to that area mhm but it sounds like youre going to have some help uh from some Finance people and some data scientists yes thats good apply Quantum optimization algorithms to enhance cash management hedging strategies Capital allocation and investment decisions while considering risk and regulatory requirements we should just go down to fi and see if someone from there could answer tell us what this job is we would get mansplained so hard anyways it says you need to come up with novel Quantum algorithms for Treasury and analytics which sounds very difficult to me coming up with any novel Quantum algorithms to me is a very ambitious goal this is a research role I think its going to be incredibly hard to find someone with like the relevant experience in both this specific area of Finance Plus plus like the quantum research background to be able to develop novel Quantum algorithms no I agree because you pretty much I dont want to say you know you need a PhD to do this kind of work but I feel like you might because learning how to develop novel Quantum algorithms is just so Technical and so hard that it requires many years of education and training so although its interesting that they didnt even specify but they didnt specify degree they dont even use the word research in this job posting its a little bit of a weird job posting like I have no doubt that this is a real job and it seems like the people writing it do have some good idea of what they would be doing and what they want but they arent listing qualifications like typical job postings do so thats a little weird I dont think they have a realistic understanding of the kind of people that would be able to fill this kind of position thats exactly what it is they know what they want but they dont know how to find those people and they dont know probably the education and the experi that those types of people would have this is an internal posting is also another possibility maybe they already have somebody in mind internally for this role and just legally this is a job posting that they had to put in public on the internet even though they know who theyre going to hire for this role thats always a possibility when you see job postings so thats another reason why you know you might never hear back from a company once you apply to them or you get ghosted or whatever sometimes it has nothing to do with you sometimes the company just already knows who they want to hire and they just had to post the job for legal reasons all right shall we move on yes we have another Consulting related one I think like summer associate is just code for like Consulting summer internship in my understanding of it so it even says here this is an internship program um about you work with other researchers to document your findings and publish scientific papers okay thats unusual and thats cool to see because a lot of these Finance or consultancy type roles dont actually encourage publication because a lot of their work has to be kept proprietary and internal but I like this because I want to know what these people are doing and I never get to really understand whats going on inside these you know Consulting hubs because theyre pretty secretive usually about their work but if it says that theyre looking for you to publish your findings then thats pretty cool and its important for interns of course to build up their resume in that way as well this one actually feels more targeted to people with that research background and theyre kind of showing that you can still like pursue your research um kind of academic career while doing this work in industry and then I dont know what this one means but contribute to companys IP by pursuing necessary protections of Ip so basically that was that saying well let you publish some things in scientific papers but also the like the secret Source also the secret Source were going were going to make that a patent yeah thats what that means but hey maybe youll get some patents on your resume you know play right theyre working in Industry you know you need to be doing stuff that is going to make the company money as well as like the kind of open science like they seem to be doing like a little bit of both thats capitalism baby uh key qualifications and skills no prior familiarity with Finance or financial use cases required okay thats cool thats an internship so theyre looking to teach you about finance things they really expect somebody to come in I think with a more theoretical understanding but not necessarily in financial applications specifically so I like that preference is given to candidates with a strong publication record okay I think this is pretty good this is a good post this is a good internship if I was working in these areas which Im not and if I was younger which Im not I would apply to this job I think this is a really solid post I like that they want you to publish I like that theyre you know looking to hire somebody with a strong publication record because this says to me that we want to grow our companys in a scientific field which I like because that means you know youre probably not only going to be publishing youre going to be going to conferences youre going to be presenting at conferences and thats the you know uh scientific Community vibe that I like that theyre opening it up quite broad like they could see someone with a Quantum information Theory background having just as much value as someone who comes from like a symmetric key cryptography background which is like quite different areas of research but both could potentially um have value here um whether youre from like a classical um software background or like a quantum theory background its a great post you know sounds really interesting so that was the last job posting that we found that we thought might be relevant what did we learn today Abby the job hunting is hard job hunting is really hard you got to know a lot of python thats what I think you got to know much want to ask for python yes and another thing I dont want to go on too long of ATT tangent on this but another thing I will say is coming from an academic background I think a lot of people expect industry type jobs which all of these were to be sort of a fallback plan if you dont make it in Academia and I think what you can really tell from this video and from the postings that we saw are that these are very very competitive jobs these are hard to get this is not a fallback plan by any means this is something that you have to work hard for and aspire to just like any academic position yeah and I think Im just excited to see more and more software related jobs coming about I think even you know a few years ago when I was first you know coming into this field I dont think there were many jobs at at all that were specifically advertised for a software audience but now were starting to see actually people that come from a traditional uh software background have a a lot of um a lot to offer and there are kind of more specific coding and software and infrastructure at ated roles that dont necessarily always require a solid Quantum background M thats good that means the field is growing and its healthy and its progressing along the timeline that we would expect it to so thats all good all right well I guess thats it for now thank you for joining us and if you see any job postings that youre interested about you know let us know in the [Music] comments
