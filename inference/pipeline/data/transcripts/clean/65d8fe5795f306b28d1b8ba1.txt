HTML HTML stands for hypertext markup language HTML is the programming language used to develop websites before we look at some HTML basics its important you know what we mean by structure and presentation with HTML every website should be designed with consideration of structure and presentation but whats the difference the structure refers to the actual content on the website whereas the presentation prefers the layout and style of the website the release is important to know the difference is we actually use a different language for each we create the structure using HTML but we create the presentation using the language called CSS the best way of looking at it is the HTML code shows the content for the CSS controls how the content is presented here is an example of CSS code remember this puts nothing on our website but once we write HTML code the CSS code will determine what that text will look like when displayed in your browser in this code we were actually describing different sections of text H refers to the header just take a look at leaves one by one so heres what header 1 looks like or h1 you can see it uses the Arial font is also centered and has two font size 32 next we have had a 3 more page 3 this uses a font from the seventh family which the collection of fonts included Times New Roman courier and more it also uses font size 16 finally we have the P code which is for paragraph this is what our main text will look like on the web page we have chosen to use a font from the sans-serif family and theres the list of cellphones weve justified our text but you cant really see here its only one word and were using the font size 12 well then youll notice the texts are all different colors thats because weve set them two different colors in our CSS code the colors are represented using hex but well look at that in more detail some other time lets now see some HTML code also just when we do load HTML code youll notice the text examples Ive got there theyre all about the same size I didnt want to change the science just to make sure it was easier to read yeah kind of so HTML code what Im gonna do is Im gonna break down the code but were gonna break it down not line by line but tag by tag okay lets start off with HTML this is known as the root element and it makes a clearly using HTML what do you notice other tags is data or text is thought in between the tags the start and the end of the tag is recognized because the ending tag has that forward slash and the start of it okay next weve got the head tag this is known as a document head and its used to contain information about the file you can see in our example the head tag actually contains information about the CSS code that we saw on the previous screen next youve got the body tag the body tag contains all the content for the page and finally you already seen h1h BMP in CSS well we also put them here as tags these are section tags header one has a clear and paragraph you can have a range of different types of headers if they had a warrant to do it a 3 and a 4 and a 5 etc the way these different sections were looked I actually defined in the CSS file as Ive already seen alright so here is our HTML code you can see here is a line for the CSS and over here is the actual content on the internal code now we will see on the right that is the content being displayed but I was if we were to ignore any CSS code okay now if we consider the CSS code in that line above because the referencing up there you will see the difference it would now make the code those exact same text but now it actually has its formal layout based on that stuff in the code and there is the CSS code in case you want to just have a quick look to see how it ends up the way it did feel free to pause the video here to make some notes alright and thats everything you need to know about HTML and it gets a bit of CSS as well
