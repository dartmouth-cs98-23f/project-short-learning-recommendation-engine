Hes an artificial intelligence we taught him to crawl to targets, but can he learn to walk? Albert can control each of his limbs, and hes rewarded for getting closer to the target, so hell learn how to use his limbs to walk. It looks like you learned how to do the worm... thats not how youre supposed to walk... I see how it is, Albert. Lets see the worm work in these next rooms. From now on youll be punished for hitting the ground, but rewarded when your feet hit the ground. No, Albert, the worm wont work here. Youll need to get a lot better with your legs to walk... Youre actually balancing! Albert, that was your first step! It wasnt very graceful, but its a start. Now were getting somewhere, Youre learning to skip! Youre getting pretty good at it, Albert! Skipping is better than the worm, I guess. But youre supposed to walk, not skip. Skipping isnt going to work for long, Albert. Nevertheless, youre almost there! Oh... you dont know how to turn... You hit the button, but theres a lot more to learn. In this room, youll be forced to learn to turn. On top of the other rewards, youll be rewarded for keeping your chest up. To make sure you dont cheat, if your chest isnt high enough, You cant hit buttons. Yes, walls exist now, Albert. It looks like youre still skipping... But at least youve hit the first button! Again?! *sigh* Thats better than jumping off the edge, I suppose. Thats two buttons! Youre almost there, Albert! You cant walk through walls, Albert. Go around it. Nice work, Albert! But this is more of a shuffle than a walk... Regardless, Well done! Now its time to learn to take real steps. For this room, you need to learn to deal with cubes. On top of the other rewards and punishments, youll also be rewarded for alternating feet. With this new reward, your shuffle isnt as good. Yes! Youre finally starting to take proper steps! but you still suck... Come on, Albert, you got this! No, Albert. Thats the wrong way... It looks like youve learned to manage the cubes! Yes! That was good, Albert, but youll need to  be a lot better to beat this final challenge. Excellent work, Albert! Now that you can walk, theres a whole new world of things to learn :)
