hello guys and welcome today I want to talk about quantum computers and how they can be practically applied to solve our most everyday problems especially I will talk about the latest developments and the latest machines that were built by now on top of that I will talk how they can be applied in the fields of biology and medicine in the fields of logistics in a field of cryptology and protecting our data as well as in fields of finance which will go from banks do optimizing the work of stock market and stock exchange which theres a really large topic and I will especially develop on it first of all lets briefly go over what quantum computers are the basis of it lies in a completely new approach to the computing instead of relying on the classical bits that are either 1 or 0 the qubits combine both since themselves the salaah seems to exist in multiple states at once enabling them to conduct a large multitude of computations at the same time this is comparable to a Schrodingers cat 2 can exist in two states at once qubits can be made of anything that exhibits quantum behavior molecules atoms electrons etc there would be even more accurate than the classical sodium based computers that have 70 to 200 percent error chance in their computation due to it not to mention that the more electrons in a molecule are used for such purpose the more possible states for it sir would be for example a molecule with 10 electrons will have 1000 possible States while a molecule with 20 electrons will have over 1 million of possible States there is also quantum entanglements it must be mentioned it interlinks all of the qubits allowing them to operate together together with superposition it allows quantum computers to process large quantities of information in far greater amounts than what classical computers can process quantum computers can calculate infinite possibilities for their inputs they can model more complex algorithms and develop far more intricate and sophisticated models the most practical application of it would be processing vast amounts of market data stock-exchange modeling molecules was all over details and intricacies for pharmacological purposes and calculating the most optimal logistical routes and those are just the name of you there are two most common types of quantum computers first is based on the quantum gate model and quantum circuits in a way it resembles the current classical computers IBM Q system one would be is a perfect example of such it is a first full-fledged commercially available quantum computer it was introduced earlier this year second type are the superconducting quantum computers the largest ones have over two thousand cubits and are produced by d-wave systems those rely on quantum annealing which is global minimum of a given function over given set of candidate solutions to get a better practical understanding and how those computers to work on practice lets take a look at IBM Q there are two main conditions that have to be met in order for the quantum computer to work first is achieving near absolute zero temperature which is around - 237 degrees Celsius second is the absolute vacuum those are no easy to achieve and maintain but they have been attained in IBM Q system one and its previous iteration on top of that there is a good reason for the entire computer to be encased in protective metal cylinder and placed in a hardened glass box Quantum chips are extremely fragile and even the slightest interference will be damaging present the prototype has managed to get twenty cubits working and operational it has also doubled its QV network volume from eight to sixteen in comparison to the last iteration such computing power opens a great potential for the practical applications in addition the considerable computing power it has the lowest error rates which are around one or two percent that are some of the lowest what IBM has ever measured this is the quantum rated computer meanings it is on par with the current classical ones the future plans involve creating a computer with a quantum supremacy or a quantum ready computer in IBMs terms that it will have a greater computing power than classical computers this should be achieved in around three to five years if everything goes to schedule as the most advanced quantum computer is the one used by Google it has 72 qubits and Google has already claimed that it has reached quantum superiority not so long ago which is a considerable milestone in quantum computing another interesting device is being developed by the Rosetta computing they aim to build 128 qubit computers that will be unveiled this year it has developed under a new form factor as the Klans itself to rapid scaling because of their in-house design with all of the teams working close together they should be able to develop and deploy new systems really quickly also Bottom computers are a new valid application of Moores law and should doubles a computer transistors performance every every year this should culminate in one of the goals of quantum computing creating a big enough quantum computers it will be infinitely more powerful than any classical computer that has ever existed the first extremely practical applications that would affect a lot of people would be the simulations of the biological molecules this would allow a significantly improved drug design and better determine positive treatment effects as well as negative side-effects another probable application would be the quantum applications for the Internet first of all it will involve encoding a qubit with Farmar information than a conventional bit can handle second it will improve the security of transmitted messages on top of quantum encoding it will be also possible to detect any attempts to intercept messages due to the nature of qubits react when they were influenced by any third party intruder such as malicious hacker or something like that it will be possible to switch to the quantum Internet once existing broadband technologies are improved photons can be used as qubits which makes fiber-optic cables applicable for search purposes moreover a recent breakthrough by Australian scientists can make erbium the prime substance for enabling it in existing networks they have found that applying a large magnetic field can greatly improve the quantum storage tab for certain nervion crystals this field which is similar to that inside the hospital MRI machine quite the magnetic field fluctuations the erbium time can then improve by a factor of thousand to more than one second the most fascinating applications of quantum computers are in the fields of finance and probably the most complex ones the entire financial market can be modeled as a quantum process where quantities that are usable for quantum computing such as covariance matrix emerged naturally in addition to that some well-known financial problems can be directly expressed in quantum mechanical form there were the scientific papers as well deeply into research in this subject of applying quantum algorithm to solve existing financial tests not to mention that having such operating point of computer was large enough capacity would provide a significant advantage to the ones who would actually own it first of all a large number of problems and finders have to do is optimization those can be addressed with quantum annealer x as it were mentioned earlier a valid application would be searching for patterns in the pasted data in order to predict future market patterns and fluctuations which is the core of any more than technical analysis it can be greatly enhanced with improved machine learning speed set quantum computers provide which would be both faster and more affordable than existing methods a long example to go through larger debt at quantities said classical computers are capable of and that they can handle and even more serviced and then youll increase in the number of qubits that we should expect finance also deals with uncertainty of future behavior of assets and their projected returns risk in financial terms is a possibility of difference between actual and expected return these risk can be purposely mitigated particularly in case of high return risky assets by selecting additional assets and creating a more stable portfolio both portfolios and assets are in critically random systems due to inherently incomplete knowledge of the market this randomness is risks it is very difficult to estimate however a numerical simulation such as Monte Carlo one can be used to estimate what an option is Wars and quantum computers can be applied to solve relative conditional issues in such calculations in this case portfolio optimization can be done using a model that is trained to identify the important data then it can be used to predict the behavior in data points which is basically the process of machine learning the particular improvements if quantum computers provide would be in splitting up as a training of such a model Monte Carlo methods statistical sampling can usually be implemented efficiently they would however require more rounds to provide an accurate estimation of the expected return and its distribution its accuracy can be further improved by modeling the parameters as statistic functions the answer is a colossal computational power required to accurately describe the system this only gets higher as the amount of data gathered increases which is an issue that quantum computers are best suited to solve and the fast reserve required algorithms can run the creators advantage to provide robust our algorithm is another important application of quantum algorithms its function is finding a particular register in unordered database at the significantly greater efficiencies and typical algorithms it can be adapted to solve optimization problems help to find flow like variables and implement Monte Carlo methods as a biodynamic portfolio optimization was successfully done on develop chips proving that and can be solved with high success rate on quantum computers in the previous dimension research paper there are other formulas that demonstrates exact working of the quantum algorithms listed in this video if one desires to get a deeper understanding of its workings I would HIGHLY advise a reader to follow the link below to the research document lets take another financial practice that can be better solved using quantum algorithms arbitrage the practice of making a profit from different prices on the same asset in different markets the problems of the subject are empty heart non-deterministic polynomial time heartless which makes them perfect for quantum algorithms to handle particularly for quantum annealer more OERs practical instances of arbitrage problems that were converted into super attic unconstrained binary optimization or cubo that when implemented on the wave quantum annealer have produced the same optimal solutions as exhaustive classical solver another important financial issue the quantum computers can successfully tackle is credit scoring being the basis of determining the risk of a loan and the likelihood of the board defaulting on payments it can be translated to q-ball problem as well it can be run on quantum annealer apart from that the problems that arise from lack of data or from having to deal with large quantities of data are prime subject of quantum computers to deal with in this case it was implemented as proof principle in one qubit as DK took it and the results have shown that future quantum annealer can be used to find optimal features in credit analysis it is also important to elaborate on the prospects of machine learning with quantum computers as was previously mentioned the entire process can be made more efficient and less time-consuming an tapas etsu produced algorithms can pickle a large diversity of tasks those would include pattern recognition data classification and many more the training of AI to perform those tasks can be significantly improved lets take a look at classification algorithms in our example each data point which is a customer can be expressed as a vector with vector space of all considered attributes each vector in turn would belong to a class a certain loan risk such as classification algorithm would be an accession to for financial predictions and the methods for running the classification algorithms on a quantum computer would be generally focused on efficiently performing projection operations Im more Brossard and gaps were pioneers of the idea of recasting the above problem in a quantum computer by expressing each data point as a quantum state they develop the idea of per month to efficiently estimate the classical distance between states by repeatedly performing swap tests alloyed also suggested out method for encoding classical data in a quantum state while also relying on swap des in both efficiency that is graters in classical algorithms there are also early suggestions for the application of quantum code classification algorithms to present recognition problems financial supply chain management is an important subject as well it has to do with meeting customer demand while avoiding unwanted stock same as classification algorithms it requires taking a significant number of factors into account relate to every specific problem it requires to learn an American from the training data set and employs regression core tool for economic forecasting it is used to gain an understanding of causal typical value of a response variable changes as an attribute is varied the optimal parameters are found by minimizing the least squares error between the training data and the values predicted by the model done by defining certain inverse of the training data metrics this can be computationally expensive for classical datasets but not for the quantum ones also V Brown and Lloyd managed to apply a powerful mathematical toolbox to perform regression on quantum computer answer example as sparse training data matrix was used to encode the models optimal fit parameters into the amplitudes of quantum state which is far faster than the fastest classical algorithm Bank has managed to improve the NIT by applying modern methods for matrix inversion and generalizing the algorithm to non sparse training data matrices another method applicable to this kind of death was Gaussian process regression the last development of the subject was done by shoot semi ski and British Shana who managed to solve the expensive data size problem by encoding the regression model into a quantum state however the solution is rather inconvenient with the current station this development in terms of project fully optimization it is very important to have a global vision of interest rate pass even when dealing with hundreds of swap instruments a standard machine learning to for this principal component analysis or PC a it amounts to finding dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a very large matrix however when the number of stocks reaches over millions the cost becomes astronomical the PCA algorithm can be run exponentially faster and the quantum processor it allows us to find approximations to the principal components of a correlation matrix as well as estimate risk and maximize profit in situations not feasible using classical methods neural networks have proved to be extremely successful at predicting markets and analyzing credit risk the key to their success lies in the ability to tackle tasks which require intuitive judgment for incomplete datasets this makes them essential for financial prediction c2 can be accelerated through quantum computing quantum annealer scan significantly reduce the computational cost of machine learning moreover once trades algorithm can be used on any classical computer the previous dimension PCA can be used to speed up the process exponentially and fooled new quantum neural network algorithms can be designed for that purpose altogether allowing the network to learn much more complex data projects coming back to Monte Carlos methods they performed best when dealing with extremely large or complex systems that can be handled otherwise as the stochastic approach is usually used to simulate the effect of uncertainties affecting the given financial object which can be stocks portfolios or options which makes Monte Carlo methods applicable to portfolio evaluation personal finance planning risk evaluation and derivatives pricing in order to obtain the most probable outcome of wide distribution or to get resolved with a very small associated error the necessary number of Monte Carlo simulation can become gigantic for example stock market simulations that are usually day-long simulations a quantum speed-up would bring a huge change greatly speeding up the process the first steps were down by Brossard courrier mosa and tab in the first part documented in the research paper the extent growers who search algorithm to construct a quantum amplitude estimation qae of item which can be used to get the quadratic speed-up in calculation of expectation values by Monte Carlo sampling it applies a series of QA operations followed by QFT from shorts quantum factoring algorithm to measure the approximate amplitude of any given state developing from the obtained results Montanaro showed that Monte Carlo simulations can run on a quantum computer with the same accuracy as classical machines as with quadratically fewer samples required je algorithm serving a source of a speedo additionally if random sampling is performed strict quantum algorithm this can provide a nozzle speed increase building up Montoneros work roben crossed route and Bromley suggested using quantum accelerated Monte Carlo to obtain quadratic speed-up in pricing financial derivatives while of Warner and dagger pioneers the idea of adapting the core principles of such efficiently estimating var and see var for financial risk analysis by applying qae algorithms they determined that var which is Value at Risk and C var which is conditional value at risk with a quadratic speed-up as well and it was actually tested by M the IBM experienced quantum computers already have several applications in the field of violence moreover some of those applications were tested and yielded great results thats considering the current initial stage of their development therefore it can be concluded that its greater Z increases our computing power will be the greater will be the speed ups and the more tests they will be able to handle it is quite certain that at one point they will become powerful enough to become destructive in the field of violence meaning that whoever would own a powerful quantum computing machine would have a tremendous advantage over others it is important to note that the above are only a few of possible applications and such fields as quantum teleportation have not even been mentioned by now it is evident that quantum computers are growing in their computing power at an increasing rate the greatest example would be the machine that has already achieved count of superiority which is created and developed by Google and the faster development goes the oceans and companies will be drawn to quantum computing which will bring a trait of the development speed with everyone contributing their
