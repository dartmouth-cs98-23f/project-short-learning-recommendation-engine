well congratulations youve almost made it almost welcome to our last lecture lecture eight in which we are going to talk about quantum error correction how to deal with quantum noise how to recover quantum states and protect our precious quantum computations or quantum communication its been long journey we started with four introductory lectures where i introduced some basic stuff for you to understand why quantum information processing is uh more powerful so we talk about quantum interference we talk about quantum entanglement and then we we we could see how quantum interference and quantum entanglement play a significant role in making quantum communication secure or computation more powerful but we also observed that the reason we do not have for example quantum computers yet is because quantum systems or quantum interference in particular is is quite fragile right so you expose it to any interaction with the environment the environment may learn about the state of the system and quantum interference is gone um so we took some time to describe the system environment kind of interaction so that is the dynamics of open quantum systems our quantum computers or quantum communication devices are open quantum system because even though we can control them to some extent theyre embedded in some sort of environment which upon which we do not have complete control so um its its not quite right to describe the evolution of open quantum system as a as a unitary evolution we know that you can take two approaches here right so you can think about the unit evolution of the whole when you include the environment thats the so-called stein spring representation but you can also look at the system alone and analyze the evolution of of such system in the presence of vine of the environment but not necessarily just including the environment in in your equation so thats the crowds representation now we have the tools so we can now move on and discuss how we can deal with quantum errors so whenever remember we call kraus operators quantum errors um but um the question really is so given a system that undergoes some sort of evolution described by a completely positive map is it possible to recover the original state of the system so i would like you to have this kind of uh scenario in mind so compare the two cases the case where we have a system lets say its a cube it is you can always choose the simplest possible quantum system so we have a qubit this qubit undergoes the coherence so interacts with the environment and as a result the state of the qubit is modified in in some way now is there a way to diminish the impact of the environment and here we are going to borrow ideas from classical theory of information so we are going to use the concept of error correcting codes so instead of this kind of scenario we are going to encode the state of the qubit into a number of qubits so we are going to bring a few more qubits and take our original qubit and we are going to perform a unitary operation maps unknown state of the qubit into a set of cubits that will form our encoded qubit so this mathematically speaking we are just going to pick up a two-dimensional hilbert space um and we are going to embed it in a higher dimensional hilbert space rotate somehow thats isometry right so that thats going to be the an encoding part and then all the qubits go to the coherence area so arrows will appear and then at this point you may be a little bit um confused you say okay well now the errors will appear on many qubits well yes but if you just take quantum state of one qubit and somehow spread this state number of qubits then the error on one qubit may not perhaps be so significant it may be possible to recover it under certain conditions and indeed we will see that under certain conditions it is possible to recover to reverse this completely positive map so the first one the errors are induced by the environment which you cannot control but as long as you can find out roughly what happened then you can then just um apply another completely positive map in this case we dont have the environment but we just bring extra even more qubits or some other quantum systems auxiliary qubits are a system that we call ancilla a kind of a helper to help us to perform in a controlled way another completely positive map so thats going to be error recovery and then once hopefully we managed to recover the original state of all those qubits then we just simply decode the quantum state so we just map the state into the qubit and hopefully well have something that is very close to the original so i would like you to have this scenario in mind and of course you know in the lecture we will go through all the details and im going to tell you how to encode how to um construct the recovery procedure and how we are going to what kind of conditions have to be satisfied for this to be possible in the first place then well say a few words about quantum computation that protects about a way of computing that you protect not only quantum state but also the whole process of computation so you would like to have your evolving state modified by your quantum logic case protected at all time well so this will essentially this will actually um conclude our basic introduction to quantum information processing it should give you some sort of simple but complete picture of how things work
