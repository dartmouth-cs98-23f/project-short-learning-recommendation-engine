to another video today we are going to be looking at my favorite course on statistics [Music] now before we get into todays video i want to give a huge shout out to todays sponsor which is udemy you guys know that i absolutely love udemy i have learned so many things and taken so many courses on their platform be sure to check them out i have a page where you can look at every single course that i recommend on topics like sql excel python tableau and more and we are going to be looking at one of the courses that i recommend today so huge shout outs to you to me thank you guys so much for sponsoring this video so something that i get asked all the time is alex do i need math and statistics to become a data analyst and my answer is almost always no i think at the beginning you really dont need it as much as knowing some of the more technical skills like sql python tableau excel but as you get further along in your career statistics it does start to become more important and so i think that learning it and knowing it is a really really important part of becoming a really good data analyst in the long term now i know that math and statistics can be a little bit intimidating at first especially if you know that youre not very good at it and so you tend to kind of push that off and not want to learn it i know i am guilty of that big time but i know that if i was able to learn it you will absolutely be able to learn it and the course that were going to look at today was one that i took and i think is a fantastic course it was one that i was really intimidated to take i didnt think that i was going to be able to really understand the concepts and understand it and apply it to my job but i really was able to do that with this course so im not going to drag this out any longer lets look at the course and see what it is as you can see on your screen it is called statistics for data science and business analysis the cost is 60 but if you use a coupon it will go down to 13.99 in the description im going to provide a coupon that worked for me that i was testing out just today just to make sure that it works that you guys could have it i dont know how long that one will last so there is a coupon in the description theres also the link to this course in the description so check that out if you want to take this course but lets get into the actual course and see what kind of things youre going to learn so really quickly lets look at the different sections of this course you have a quick introduction then it talks about the difference between a sample and a population and you go into the fundamentals of descriptive statistics then you look at measures of central tendency asymmetry and variability then it gives you a bunch of practice examples so you actually get to test out all these things that youre learning then you go over distributions estimators and estimates confidence intervals and these are the more advanced topics as it says practice examples of inferential statistics i personally thought this was the hardest one but again if i can get it you can get it i promise you then it goes into hypothesis testing hypothesis testing where you actually get to try these things and put them into a real project then it goes into some more testing um but then it gets into the regression analysis regression analysis is super important if youve never really looked into statistics for a data analysis or data science or anything like that regression analysis is very popular and so it is very good to know and this course does a really good job at going through that talks a little bit more about regression analysis and then uh were going to look at categorical data and how to deal with that and then at the very end you have a practice example for regression analysis now if youve never done any statistics with actual data before these calculations can be very intimidating again i use that word because thats how i felt you may not feel that way but this stuff looks very very confusing uh the thing that i love most about this course right here is it makes it super super simple and it uses really good simple examples and how to actually walk through these so that you can understand them and then you get to practice them afterwards typically in a small practice example or a quiz i personally found this extremely useful i didnt know it at the time but in a previous job i was actually doing a lot of this stuff i just didnt know what it was called and so it was really funny when i started taking this course after id had my very first job as a data analyst i actually was using a lot of these different calculations to get my work done and so i didnt even know what i was doing i just was doing it and so now that i can actually make some sense of it and understand it it became a lot more useful and so this really helped me put into perspective some of the work that i was doing but also gave me a lot of ideas for some more advanced things that i could be doing as well now im really not going to go super in depth into everything that youre going to learn in this course i feel like if you dont know statistics super well me walking through each of the things that youre going to learn really wont make a huge difference but as youre walking through this course it starts out super simple it goes even to the more advanced concept and its all done in excel or on some type of like powerpoint so its not really that difficult you dont have to download any special software as long as you have excel you can do everything that they do in this video so to go back to something that i was talking about earlier when somebody asked me where they can learn math and statistics i almost always point them to this course right here and thats because i have taken it i have come back to it time and time again and ive learned a lot of things from this course as well as actually used it in my job and so i know its actually applicable its not just something that youre gonna take and never ever use again this is something that i promise everyone who becomes a data analyst or data scientist they will use something in this video whether they know it or not but knowing it and understanding what youre actually doing is extremely beneficial and i came to learn that kind of the hard way or later on in my career and so im glad that i took this course im really glad that i can share it with you i hope that if you take it you can really understand the concepts and really apply it to your career thank you guys so much for watching i really appreciate it if you like this video be sure to like and subscribe below and ill see in the next video [Music] you
