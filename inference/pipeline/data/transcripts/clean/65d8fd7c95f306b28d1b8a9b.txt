database systems were gonna go over some terminology on on what is a database well what do we need it for why is it important now data are facts that are recorded and can be accessed now theres different data formats you know theres text numbers figures graphics of data images audio video recordings of data and more really really everything is this data and some type of format you know you can have your bank account you know theres data for your bank account theres you know an excel sheet theres data inside it you know when youre you know theres just so many different examples and indeed ORS recorded and kept because is considered to be you to be abuse to an intended user so you know if youre collecting data for a job and then you have to present that information you keep it because it you know your intended user is a client or you know whatever your youre presenting the data for now information refers to the data that is accessed by a user for some particular purpose so typically typically getting the needed information from a collection of data requires performing an activity so for example you have a bunch of numbers you know and you need those numbers to be turned into information you know and so just searching through processing or manipulating the data in some sort of some sort of fashion now we have metadata now what is metadata thats data that describes the structure and the properties of the data you know metadata is essential for the proper understanding and use of the data so you know you have your metadata and then you have your data you know metadata is a collection of a bunch of different information or excuse me data and you turn that into data you know to be able to turn into information now data without metadata now this is an example is you know what is this telling us you know we have 0 0 0 1 b2 and then you know 1101 now we can assume you know that 1101 right here we highlight this now we can assume right here that this is time but we dont know that though you know its in the format of time but without you know the metadata you know were not gonna know what this is you know an example of this also you know this can be some type of identification number could be an ID number thats you know referencing a product you know lets say the product is B and this could be the number of those products or how many were sold at this time but we really dont know that we dont know what this information is you know and with metadata you know youre gonna be able to see that this is a transaction ID from the previous slide so now we know what this is you know the data before just was just a bunch of numbers and characters and letters but we dont really know what it was though you know metadata is gonna show us that this is a transaction ID this is a product you know this is the amount of items sold and on the previous ayat we previous slide we assumed that it was time but it is time you know 1101 so metadata is going to give us the information on how to interpret the data and this is the data this is the excuse me for my bad handwriting but this is the data and the metadata helps it helps us determine what the data is okay now what is a database database is a structured collection of related data stored on a computer medium now the database organizes the data in a way that facilitates efficient access to the information capturing the data so database think of it like a like a trash can you know all the information is stored in there and its gonna help us be able to pick out the information that we need and a database metadata represents the structure of the database so a database content that that is not the data itself the data about data you know it could contain names of data structures data types data descriptions other information describing the kerricks of the data you know on a database management system or abbreviated DBMS is a software used for now a DBMS could be you know access or Oracle or a bunch of other type of actual database management systems and reduce for the creation of databases insertion storage retrieval update and deletion of the data in the database now a database system is a computer based system whose purpose is to enable an efficient interaction between the user and the information captured in the database so a good example again is access Microsoft Access was for most of us are familiar with now this is a good example of a database okay now this is the core you notice the databases where all the information is stored in a database management system can be access you know Microsoft Access lets just assume that this is Microsoft acts yes okay and made for Microsoft Access now think of this as Microsoft Access in the database is all the information inside Microsoft Access you know and you have your front-end application you know this can be the user know this is you accessing Microsoft Access to access the information which is the database okay and what is a what does a front-end application you know provides a mechanism for easy interaction between the user and the database management system and the end user which is the users using a database system to support their tasks and processes now in direct interaction is the end user communicating with the database through front-end applications and then direct interaction is the end user communicating with the database directly through the database management system heres an example okay this is say this is you you know youre a programmer or youre the database administrator and youre directly accessing the database management system okay now lets say youre not a programmer youre just an employee and you use a front-end application which could be you know you can create that in the access itself to be able to access the database management system now this is a good example if you are an employee you know at a you know lets say a fortune 500 company the companys not gonna want you to be able to have direct access to the database to be able to manipulate the data inside the database management system so they deploy a front-end application to where you can only collect or you know retrieve information from the database management system but you cant manipulate the data inside the database management system now steps and development of a database system now you have your database requirements know what what are you needing you know you need to collect the information define you dont visualize so this is the starting process of you know think of like a building your own business and this is a business plan what do you need okay and then you need to model the database to start to model it you know create it right on a piece of paper you know from there you go to the implementation stage where you start to build it you know and youre also developing you know front-end applications for indirect access which could be for the employee you dont want them to have direct access you just want them to be able to retrieve information thats what developing front-end applications is now then you start to have the deployment you know deployment sages were it becomes live youre deploying it now from there you have the database use which now you have your indirect or direct use which could be you know the employee accessing it or the you know the administrator accessing you have your database administration and maintenance so this is gonna be your your database management you know programmer or associate or some of thats gonna maintain the database now requirements collections definition and visual visualization now is the results in the requirements specifying which data that future database system will hold and in what fashion so know what are we creating is essentially what its saying and what the capabilities and functionalities of the database system will be you know the collector requirement should be clearly defined and stated in a read and document and then visualized so youre youre creating something from not think okay in the conceptual database model no a visualization of requirements by using a conceptual data modeling technique such as an entry relationship diagram or ER diagram okay now this
