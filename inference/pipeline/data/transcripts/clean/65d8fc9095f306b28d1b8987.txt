the latest movie recommended by Netflix at his friends place before heading out he asked Siri about the weather and realized it would rain so he decided to take his Tesla for the long journey and switched to autopilot on the highway after coming home from the eventful day he started wondering how technology has made his life easy he did some research on the internet and found out that Netflix Siri and Tesla are all using AI so what is AI AI or artificial intelligence is nothing but making computers-based machines think and act like humans artificial intelligence is not a new term John McCarthy a computer scientist coined the term artificial intelligence back in 1956 but it took time to evolve as it demanded heavy computing power artificial intelligence is not confined to just movie recommendations and virtual assistants broadly classifying there are three types of AI artificial narrow intelligence also called weak AI is the stage where machines can perform a specific task Netflix Siri chat Bots spatial recommendation systems are all examples of artificial narrow intelligence next up we have artificial general intelligence referred to as an intelligent agents capacity to comprehend or pick up any intellectual skill that a human can we are halfway in a successfully implementing this space IBMs Watson supercomputer and gpt3 fall under this category and lastly artificial super intelligence it is the stage where machines surpass human intelligence you might have seen this in movies and imagined how the world would be if machines occupied fascinated by this John did more research and found out that machine learning deep learning and natural language processing are all connected with artificial intelligence machine learning a subset of AI is the process of automating and enhancing how computers learn from their experiences without human health machine learning can be used in email spam detection medical diagnosis Etc deep learning can be considered a subset of machine learning it is a field that is based on learning and improving on its own by examining computer algorithms while machine learning uses simpler Concepts deep learning works with artificial neural networks which are designed to imitate the human brain this technology can be applied in face recognition speech recognition and many more applications natural language processing popularly known as NLP can be defined as the ability of machines to learn human language and translate it chat Bots fall under this category artificial intelligence is advancing in every crucial field like healthcare education robotics banking e-commerce and the list goes on like in healthcare AI is used to identify diseases helping healthcare service providers and their patients make better treatment and lifestyle decisions coming to the education sector AI is helping teachers automate grading organizing and facilitating parent Guardian conversations in robotics ai-powered robots employ real-time updates to detect obstructions in their path and instantaneously design their routes artificial intelligence provides Advanced data analytics that is transforming banking by reducing fraud and enhancing compliance with this growing demand for AI more and more Industries are looking for AI Engineers who can help them develop intelligent systems and offer them lucrative salaries going north of one hundred and twenty thousand dollars future of AI looks promising with the AI Market expected to reach 190 billion dollars by 2025. so on that note I have a question for you artificial intelligence is about playing a computer game creating a device using your own intelligence to program an intelligent machine investing your brain power in a machine give the correct answer along with your reasoning and stand a chance to win an Amazon voucher think about it and leave your answers in the comments section and we will provide the answer next week we hope you enjoyed this video if you did a thumbs up would be really appreciated heres your reminder to subscribe to our Channel and click on the Bell icon for more on the latest Technologies and Trends thank you for watching and stay tuned for more from Simply learn [Music]
