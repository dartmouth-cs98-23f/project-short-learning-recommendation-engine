and it could represent a fundamental change from the way we process information today. Plus it could enable us to understand our world in new and different ways potentially solving previously intractable problems. So think about the implications, right. Experts are already looking into ways quantum computing could be used in areas like financial services, chemistry, artificial intelligence, and like so many recent advancements in technology. Quantum computers could change how we approach cybersecurity. Were considering how quantum could disrupt the very basis of todays encryption methods and impact cryptography standards, and I know it can be pretty easy to think Ive got plenty of time quantum computing is years from mature raishin, but thats only partially true. Yes, quantum computers are in the early stages of development, but the reality is the time to prepare was yesterday because encrypted data stolen today could eventually be in the hands of cyber attackers wielding more advanced quantum computers tomorrow, but fortunately theres help. Researchers are now developing alternative methods designed to protect data as quantum computing progresses and these new methods could really change the way we think about an approach cybersecurity. Were gaining these new understandings of how to apply quantum safe cryptography to help protect systems and data against current and future attacks its honestly never too early to prepare companies today can start building an understanding of the potential impact to their sensitive data and they can educate their security teams on quantum computing and quantum safe cryptography. Now is the time to start making your security strategy quantum ready.
