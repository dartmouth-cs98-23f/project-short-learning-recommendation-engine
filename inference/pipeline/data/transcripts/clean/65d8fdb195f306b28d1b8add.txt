So time has gone So human-computer interaction comes from a book in the 80s and it was about it was called the psychology of human-computer interaction Im gonna leave a link in the description and you probably come to this video because you may be thinking about studying human-computer interaction or HCI and what effectively that is is its the psychology of Interaction between humans and computers. So I am a practicing UX designer and UX actually is the wider spectrum human-computer action is a part of that and so is graphic design and then theres other things like industrial design like the actual Physical design of the device so UX is I guess its all the jobs are called Its its just the practice in version of ACI. HCI is a form of M I guess its its studyin and it specifically studying the interaction between humans and computers So because computers have a dialogue with people and its not like just a hammer that you use and you use it However, it kind of feeds back. Theres a lot of psychology that goes on so The study of human-computer interaction is really understanding the psychology of the person using the device and theres lots of different ways you can I Guess you can affect the psychology of someone using and that might be okay Just making things simple. So people like using the product but in my opinion, theres parts of graphic design which come into HCI so that could be Like the type of images they use that affects peoples psychology So when Obama was doing his campaign they did lots of a B test about the type of images that he used on his website to get people to sign up and They found that maybe color ones work better than black and white ones in this whole article about our link to in the description So thats interesting to the whole psychology around there then there is of a bit of a typography all these bits work into HCI and So what I found theres a found a couple of great resources for you. Im going to leave a link in the description So I found the best Colleges and universities in America that do HCI and you might want to check them out Ive also got a free course on my website a better self so it takes about an hour you learn all the basics of UX design which HCI is a part of and Thats linked in the description as well and Ill leave a link to the original book from the 80s So I think hates you guys moved on from the 80s its moved on to your ex design because actually theres other things than just the One-on-one interaction between the pet and advice these things like sound and theres I think Aesthetics is really really important the way you know, Apple made the devices feel nice they made kind of like luxury products With the Braun reinvented the way products were designed and Id say thats actually part of the human-computer interaction. Not just the actual interface Design, a lot of people ask whats best to study is it I studied graphic design is a graphic designer human-computer interaction I think graphic design is great because you can Write x Don so graphic design is great because you can apply all of those all of those graphic design theories apply to computers But human-computer interactions great if you just want to focus on the side column or a cycle like psychological bits the research bets the The juicy bits of understand and how people interactive computers I hope that lesson made sense guys, if you think of it as a way, its much alike and Subscribe, Im trying to grow this channel as fast as I can.
