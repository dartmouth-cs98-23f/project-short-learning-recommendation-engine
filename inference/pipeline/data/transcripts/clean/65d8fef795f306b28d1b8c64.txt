topic is number theory number theory is simply the study of integers which seems easy and even unnecessary I mean integers are just 0 1 to negative 10 negative 49 and so on no decimals or anything like that but its far from easy 90% of what I research for this video just couldnt be thrown in because it was really advanced but one big application of this field is cryptography whenever you buy something online or input your password into a website you can think number theory for helping keep those secure most of us learned many basic concepts of number theory starting in elementary school for example you know 28 is divisible by 7 and why is that because you can multiply 7 by another integer to get 28 you also know that the greatest common factor of lets say 24 and 40 is 8 because 8 is the biggest number that goes into both but what if you were asked if 24 times 9 plus 40 times 7 is divisible by 8 well this is really saying is there some integer that I can multiply by 8 to get that number and you should be able to recognize that if you divide both sides by 8 which is the same as dividing each term by 8 you can cancel certain terms like the 24 and the 8 and the 40 and the 8 leaving integers on top and ones on the bottom and this definitely leads to an integer in our case at 62 but we really didnt care about that we just wanted to find out if this side was divisible by 8 and now we know that it is why that worked is because the 24 and 40 were both divisible by 8 it did not matter what these two numbers were in fact 24 times any integer plus 40 times any other integer is always divisible by 8 and now you can see why this is a linear combination of two numbers in this case its 24 and 40 now heres something you probably dont know yet what is the smallest positive integer you can get from this if we set em to negative 1 and end to 1 then do the addition we get 16 but if we set em to 2 and end to negative 1 we get 8 which is our smallest one now so 16 wont be our answer maybe we set em to 5 and n 2 negative 3 then we get 0 but we are only looking for the smallest positive integer therefore zero and negatives dont count now the answer to this is actually 8 you wont find anything smaller than that the smallest positive integer will actually always be the greatest common factor of the two numbers you are doing the linear combination of remember that for this next puzzle lets say we have an infinite amount of rulers half of them measure 7 centimeters and the other half measure 5 centimeters yes I know its a small length but just go with it there are no markings on them and we cannot estimate anything like what 1/2 or 1/4 of the length is we only know that they measure 7 and five centimeters respectively the question is can we perfectly measure a distance of 2 centimeters now this should be pretty easy you lay down the seven centimeter ruler then the five on top of that with their ends at the same point the distance from the beginning of the seven to the beginning of the five would measure two centimeters all we did was take the seven centimeter ruler subtract the 5 centimeter one and we get two the next question is could we measure 3 centimeters perfectly after a little thought you should see we can lay down to 5 centimeter rulers and then a 7 on top of that with the ends lined up the distance from the beginning of the first 5 to the beginning of the 7 would then be 3 centimeters again the formula B 2 of the 5 centimeter rulers minus one of the sevens gives us 3 now the generic question is can we measure any integer lengths could we measure 71 centimeters or what if instead we had an eighty-seven centimeter ruler and a 39 centimeter ruler what can we measure that well in our example we know we can achieve a measure of three centimeters by two 5s - a seven that means if you want to achieve 6 centimeters we can just multiply both sides by 2 if we distribute that 2 we see that 4 of the 5 centimeter rulers - two of the seven centimeter ones gives us exactly 6 centimeters and we can use this to get any multiple of three remember I said earlier that the smallest positive integer you can achieve is the greatest common factor of the two numbers which in our case are the two ruler links the greatest common factor of those is 1 so we can achieve a measure of one centimeter or any integer multiple of that which basically means any positive integer we want if we wanted to measure 833 centimeters we could and thats what the solution to this is the smallest measure you can make is the greatest common factor of the ruler lengths then you can also make a measure of any positive integer multiple of that if our ruler lengths are 91 centimeters and 26 centimeters the greatest common factor is 13 so we can measure 13 centimeters or 26 39 52 and any integer multiple 13 but nothing in between yes this was a simple example of number theory but I thought it was a good easy-to-follow problem now if you want an intro about this application of cryptography the foundation for securing our information is large prime numbers its actually very difficult even for computers to factor a really big number into two primes for example 13 is prime and so is 19 multiply those together and you get 247 if you handed that number to someone it would not be so easy for them to break it down into its two prime factors to be fair this one and take too long but do it with numbers with hundreds of digits and even a supercomputer cant do it in a reasonable amount of time the fastest algorithm we know of its called the general number field sieve but when you get to several hundred digits this algorithm becomes unfeasible so like I talked about in the computer science video if we wanted to transmit the phrase hello we could turn that into a prime number like by turning each letter into whatever number place it is in the alphabet H is the eighth letter E is the fifth letter and so on then we just add a small ending to make it prime then you and your friend who you want to send this message to could exchange a secret key which is a really big prime number as well when you want to transmit hello you just multiply it by your secret key and send that to your friend if someone intercepts it they could not decipher it if they knew they were looking for two prime numbers that go into this big number even with a computer it would take a long time to figure out at least if the numbers are really big so they wont know what the message actually says but your friend would just divide by the secret key and recover the message but unfortunately theres a huge flaw with this if someone intercepts your message which is your secret key times your actual message then they intercept another message which would be your secret key times another actual message they could easily find your secret key because it would be the greatest common factor of the two numbers they intercept it and there are ways to determine this very efficiently now while researching this video and the last one I was going through lectures textbooks practice problems and more to figure out what would be ideal to include but 90% of what I came across had me saying this would be too difficult to accept this will take too long they need more background for this and so on so realize this video and the last one dont really do justice for these huge fields of mathematics and computer science I did talk more about number theory in the computer science video such as with the Euclids algorithm and finding the greatest common factor of two big numbers so Im not really going to go into much more detail but I thought these were just some fun examples theyre really highlight how different math can be especially at a university level compared to what you may think and thats what Im going to end this video if you enjoyed please like and subscribe dont forget to follow me on Facebook and Twitter and Ill see you all in the next video
