what foundations are to buildings. Build it wrong, and no matter how  beautiful it looks, itll crumble. In today’s discussion, we’ll unpack  some prevalent software architecture   patterns that form the backbone of countless  applications and platforms we interact with daily. Over the next few minutes, well explore five  key patterns that have shaped the industry. Lets start with layered architecture. This pattern separates the components  of a system into distinct layers,   typically the presentation layer, business  logic layer, and data access layer. For instance, in user interface design, we often  see the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern. It is a specialized form of layered architecture. Here, the Model represents data and  business logic, the View displays this data,   and the Presenter serves as a bridge to  ensure a clean separation of concerns. The primary goal of layered architectures is to   promote separation so changes in one  layer dont negatively impact others. This structure provides  abstraction and encapsulation,   with each layer having a distinct responsibility. Next is event-driven architecture. This pattern promotes the  production and consumption   of events between loosely coupled  software components and services. Components broadcast events  when something notable happens,   and other components subscribe to  specific events they are interested in. This allows for highly decoupled architectures. One prominent example in this domain is Command  Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS). With CQRS, the data write operations (commands)  are separated from read operations (queries),   and changes are often communicated through events. This makes the system inherently event-driven. The pub/sub model, where components  publish and subscribe to events,   is commonly used in such architectures. Here, components dont call each other  directly; they merely react to published events. Moving on to microkernel architecture. This pattern emphasizes separating  core system functionality into   a small microkernel and extended  functionality into add-ons or plugins. In operating systems, for example, a  microkernel might oversee vital tasks   like inter-process communication while offloading  other system functions to external components. An application example is the Eclipse IDE: its  core runtime handles the plugin architecture,   and features from Java tools to Git  integration are delivered as plugins. This design prioritizes extensibility,  ease of maintenance, and fault isolation. Whether its an OS component or an  Eclipse plugin that encounters an issue,   the core system remains stable and unaffected. Then we have microservices architecture. This decomposes an application into a  collection of small, loosely coupled services. Each service implements  specific business capabilities,   contains its own data model,  and communicates via APIs. Netflix, for instance,   uses microservices to handle everything  from movie recommendations to billing. This architecture promotes modularization of  functionality so services can be developed,   deployed, and scaled independently. It increases agility, and allows companies  like Netflix to rapidly innovate. The trade-off, however, is the added  complexity in managing inter-service   communication and maintaining data consistency. Last but certainly not least,  we have monolithic architecture. At its core, a monolithic design sees all  components of the application — from data   access and business logic to the  user interface — bundled together   into a single codebase and run as a single unit. This approach simplifies  development and deployment,   making it a go-to for many  startups and smaller applications. However, its worth noting the  rise of the modular monolith. This approach retains the benefits of  a single deployable unit but emphasizes   clear modular boundaries within the codebase. This allows for easier  maintenance and scalability. Its a middle ground which offers the  simplicity of a monolith while paving   the way for potential future transitions  to architectures like microservices. Regardless of the approach, many successful  platforms start with a monolithic or modular   monolithic structure before considering  more distributed architectures. And there you have it, a quick tour of five  foundational software architecture patterns. The right choice always depends on our specific  challenges, requirements, and contexts.
