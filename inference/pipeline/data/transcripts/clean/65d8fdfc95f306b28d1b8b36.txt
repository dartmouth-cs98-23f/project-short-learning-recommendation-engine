is a work from notebook so in this notebook you can type text you can have like you know your coding move from language you can have you know visualization literally we can have everything so its an integrated environment uh so first thing is that like you know as you may know like you know well for Mathematica it has more than you know 6 000 building you know uh functionalities each of those functionalities there are for a specific core area I dont know calculus you know algebra like you know machine learning and then like you know very recently since last year like you know we have been working on like you know developing a collection of functions for doing any sort of quantum computation in a finer dimensional space so one more time like you know its any Quantum computation in the final dimensional you know Hillary space and what we call it is basically is a packlet so packlet is basically like you know a collection of functionalities that are you know interconnected and after installing the packlet you can have access to all of those functions so first is the block you know you just need to evaluate like you know this code to get what we call as well from Quantum framework and as of now like you know these are the list of functionalities that we have supporting any Quantum computation the beauty of like you know having packlet is that like you know theyre very similar to any other function that you have involved for Mathematica like you know you see here like you know if you click you know on that you would see like you know the documentation page so each of you know these functionalities they have their own documentation page and like any other documentation like you know the format is the same like you know basic examples its called properties and like you know you can find you know other you know for example I dont know this is the list of you know functions that we have you see like you know basis objects you know uh manipulation of that entanglement circuit so that that thats the collection that we have so like you know after installing the packlet like you know its like you have those you know 20 something like you know Quantum functionalities with the corresponding documentation um we did our best to have a documentation with no issue but they might be you know some some minor issues like you know if you spotted anything please let us know and we would correct that uh its like you know the main purpose of this session is having an introduction to to Quantum Computing using our framework so Im going to start with something very basic at the very fundamental level the way that we deal with many of any Quantum computation is like this within some process whatever that process like you know we are going to discuss about that very soon but you know within a process what we do is you know at the very end we prepare a Quantum estate and that Quantum estate is installed like you know in uh one or many uh physical systems uh in quantum theory the simplest system that we have is a system of you know Dimension two basically thats a system that like you know in the simplest case you can describe it by a vector of two with two amplitudes and those amplitudes they can get like you know complex numbers they can be pure they can be complex but what you see here like you know lets say that you know something happened and at the end like you know you prepare like you know this Quantum mistake okay uh Quantum estate like after evaluating that like you know Quantum is stating a framework like you know its an object and this is basically the like you know the summary box you know for that object dont be scared of you know the summary box like you know if you want like you know you can look at the traditional form on Mac the short key is command shift T so you know thats basically the broadcast notation the traditional form okay so Im using like you know uh the the short key or you can simply like you know uh wrap it around you know traditional form and you can see it like that short key was literally like an applying this function on that stick the beauty of like you know this object is that you know they contain lots of interesting information that it can help you to get like you know uh to have an idea like you know what youre doing but you know what is the picture uh What is this state its a pure State format and trophies you know uh zero its one physical system the number of Q This Dimension etc etc but anyhow like you know lets focus on the on the big picture so uh a physical process happen like you know we prepare a Quantum State and then the next step that we do is we do measurement remember like you know in quantum theory measurement is very different from any other transformation so like you know whatever transformation whatever process that is happening on Quantum system measurement is different so what Im doing here and think about it like you know very similar to like other functionalities that we have in both of Mathematica a function it acts on another function and then and the results is an outcome so here like you know our Quantum measurement acts on basically this is the input for this function Im saying that were going to measure it in you know computational basis or some details like you know for example if you do not know like you know how to do that like just just look at the documentation so this is the documentation and like you know it contains all the information that you need regarding that function but anyhow lets again let you know let me just briefly review and then Im going to go into the detail so a state is prepared and then at the end you do a measurement uh in our framework because like you know we have all other functionalities involved for mathematical you can calculate the corresponding probabilities remember quantum theory the best description at the end is giving you which what probability you can get the corresponding outcome and this is what we get out of log you know this spatial state okay so like you know thats basically the bar chart of like you know uh that measurement thats not what is happening in practice because these probabilities like you know well for Mathematica it calculates them exactly meaning because you know we have you know statistic probability functionality these are the exact numbers in reality like you know in experiment just let me show you like you know a special case that I have simulated an experiment you have to basically repeat the ex the measurement and you would get a collection of results okay so in this very special case you know what Im doing here Im simulating you know the measurement results and Im saying that you know do it you know too many times okay and this is basically you know what Im getting here and then like you know out of that you can you know calculate the corresponding frequencies so what Im doing here is Im just let me just show you this text of the cell right now okay count them the result is an association it says like you know for one you know you got 18 results for zero you got two results and then the next step Im just telling you know normalize that based on like you know let me just use you know this syntax which means like you know check this you know outcome here Im just saying Im going to normalize by total you know because I want to get you know the probabilities its just like you know how to get the probabilities this is basically you know the frequency that we get this is this is what happens in experiment of course like you know in reality there are noise and many other complexities but anyhow like you know thats what you would get and you can look you know compare them together you know easily but uh the the orange one is like you know the exact like you know thats exact calculation and the blue one is what you get out of the experiment uh please note that like you know because again you know in Wolfram language we can have you know symbolic calculation and again you know all of those statistics and uh uh probability functionalities the results that we calculate I know like you know I refer to them as a sort of log you know simulation but they are exact as well again on purpose I put it like you know as exact and uh this is a very unique feature about our framework but you know if you want to reproduce like another measurement results in other you know Quantum Frameworks the best they would do is they run it you know a couple of times I dont know 1024 times and they just tell you like you know what counts for each measurement uh this is the core idea of like you know any Quantum computing that thats it okay like you know its prepare a very particular State and do a measurement and for the measurements you know at the experimental level we get like you know a collection of results and then based on that you know we want to do a very particular you know computation that thats it uh the biggest headache is usually like you know how to prepare a very particular state that is suitable for a very particular goal for a very particular like you know uh objective that we have and how to prepare that okay so thats the whole idea of like you know developing a Quantum algorithm for a very particular purpose okay but let me just comment a little bit more about like you know Quantum measurement because you know remember that you know in quantum theory you can do Quantum measurement in many possible ways for example the previous example that I showed you was lets say like you know pretending that this is a simulation of an actual like you know Quantum Processing Unit it was in computational basis zero and one you can change that basis you can do it for example in poly X and you would get you know the corresponding probabilities so these are the results in poly X and this is the result like you know in uh uh for like you know computational basis so that for that measurement you have lots of freedom okay so thats a big picture a Quantum estate you do a measurement and for a measurement like you know the best is like you know you can calculate some you know frequencies and then you have to ask okay what what I can learn out of those frequencies okay what kind of you know operation uh I can do with that uh so first what what Quantum estate given like you know any initial State like you know lets say that you know you you prepare your system in a particular State and then you want to transform that state in quantum theory this transformation can be done in many different ways okay for example like you know one possible way is doing it in a unitary way this is what we usually have as Quantum operator and quantum theory so what Im doing here Im just saying that you know okay prepare a very particular State and then apply like you know poly X poly X you know in two Dimension is you know its still you know literally the same like you know not uh operator and of course Im sure you guys know that like you know you go from zero to one so this is the transformation like you know Im showing you the the simplest case but like you know then the next step for any Quantum algorithm is what is the collection of you know transformation for a very particular objective what what we can do like you know uh how we can compose a very particular you know transformation so let me focus on like you know the idea of like you know uh transformation like you know how I can change this state uh just like you know a common terminology that we have in quantum theory because again like you know the most popular you know Quantum systems or Quantum system in two Dimension but you know a spin half system uh for example let me show you like you know a case that Im preparing like you know a random pure State and Im just looking at the amplitudes okay so this is literally like you know uh uh for this basis you know this is the amplitude and thats the other one this is basically the same like for example in our framework the another term that we have for that is a state Vector but you see like you know behind the scene you know for us as state Vector is a sports array and if you want to see like another actual form just like you know look at the normal okay so that thats what you get uh of course you know when youre you know looking at this state you know Vector remember like you know the order like you know this amplitude corresponds to what you know uh element of your basis either you know if you dont know that for example look at the amplitude because you know it shows you like you know the keys here are basically like you know the element of the quantum basis that youre using but anyhow like you know so for the simplest Quantum system you know we can describe it by a vector a vector of two elements that can be like you know complex another way of you know representing that is by a vector in three dimension and this is what we usually call as a block vector uh each of these objects each of these objects that we have in our framework they have a long list of properties that you can find you know in our documentation page like you know oops I went to the documentation for let me just show you the documentation page here and if you click on the details like you know there is an explanation here like for example here in a block spherical coordinate you know coordinates of computed block Cartesian like you know so it gives you the Cartesian coordinates so this is basically Cartesian coordinate and this is you know the spherical coordinate of you know R Theta and Phi uh this is basically the three-dimensional you know visualization so you have a sphere and like you know this Vector represents the same state as what we have here this representation is very popular like you know those of you if you want to work like you know in in this field you need to know more about like you know uh blocker sphere because uh this is one of those knowledge like many times many want to describe anything we refer to the you know block vector and what happens to that okay let us focus on a very simple case okay so what Im doing here is that plugin Im preparing like you know important state in a zero State I guess you already noticed like you know I havent mentioned that but look at here like you know the quantum estate is taking a string as an input so this is exactly the same as doing it as a vector when the first element is one so in the second element is Z1 so this is by definition thats how we Define log you know zero State and as you notice like you know all other functionalities that you have in in Wolfram language like you know you can apply it on the on the top of you know Quantum objects but anyhow let us continue like you know with our story so what Im doing here Im just doing you know a simple transformation Im saying that like you know this function which is a rotation with a given you know a vector is acting on that initial State and that initial state is basically or zero State and then Im looking at the Block plot of that state we can just you know wrap it by manipulator and you see here like you know it is clear like you know its the rotation around the y-axis that that we have here by corresponding you know angle Theta okay so its just a simple transformation now let me make a composition of like you know these operations in two steps Im gonna say like you know first step Im gonna apply rotation and you see here like you know the notation that Im using here is a functional notation here Im just using the prefix notation okay its just like you know different syntaxes that we have involved form language but anyhow what Im doing here Im just saying that you know first applied rotation around y by the corresponding angle Theta on this initial State and on the result apply rotation around C and as you can see like you know for example you know this is the rotation at all y-axis and now a rotation around you know z-axis we can go from a final state different we can go from an initial state to a final state so the idea of like you know a composition like you know this is what we usually call as a composition like you know two transformation apply on a particular State this is basically the very fundamental idea of like you know a circuit so whenever we talk about the circuit a circuit is literally like you know a collection of like you know uh different operations and those operations like you know Im on purpose Im saying operation in the most generic term because they can be even non-unitary non-trace preserved they can be anything it can be a noise it can be you know stochastic it can be a Quantum Channel it can be literally anything but here you know Im just considering the the a very simple case like exactly the previous situation that first rotation around y then rotation around the C now this is basically in language of uh circuits uh the the most common thing about the quantum circuit is you know the corresponding visualization which is what you see here each vertical wire each horizontal wire it represents the quantum State and each of these boxes is basically your transformation and here we should read from left to right okay so it means this guy here you know rotation around why it acts first and after that Z so remember like you know Im writing it here like you know left to right and that thats the very first operation that is happening uh there are some like you know the way that you can build your circuit Im gonna show you you know some complicated examples but anyhow like you know either you can literally the way that Im doing it here include your objects but you see here like you know somebody would say ah look you know this is redundant Im just repeating you know Quantum operator can I get rid of that oh yeah of course you know you can do that you know we also support like you know those uh shorthand notations so basically literally like you know whenever you have Quantum operator wrapped around that you know you can just remove that and that that maybe helps with writing the code or reading that so its like you know basically rotation around y by corresponding you know angle rotation around Z by the corresponding and your line you can easily again like you know check that you know they are the same these two are the same thing uh one very important feature of like in a Wolfram language is that you can do symbolic computation as you can see here you know this circuit is a symbolic circuit Im not assigning any value to parameter you know Theta and Phi okay there are literally like like a symbol and you can what you can do is you can say okay uh this circuit now I want it to act on an initial estate so the way that you can do it is just like you know active like you know that second I call it you know Crump and you know it can act on any Quantum mistake whatever is that Quantum State okay for example this this is a state representing in a one qubit so it can go even with the random queue or like you know whatever state you like many times we prepare all of our Q bits in the ground state meaning all of them are in the zero State because thats the most common way of like you know dealing with you know Quantum systems in Quantum Computing one shorthand notation is just dont give any input whenever you are not giving any input behind the scene what we do is we are going to set whatever Quantum system that you have all of them at the ground state zero okay so like you know basically this operation that you see here Quantum state zero and then like you know this circuit acting on that is the same as this operation but anyhowload you know this is a transformation like you know a transformation of the state and then you can look at like you know the amplitude and these all the amplitudes that that we got as you can see here these amplitudes are still you know in the symbolic form okay this is one important thing that you remember about you know both of language uh it has a very you know strong feature maybe the characteristic trait of like in a Wolfram language is that you can do symbolic calculation okay now so lets lets jump like let me give you more information about like you know okay this composition of operation which is basically the wrapper around them is our Quantum circuit operator you can do whatever you want lets try to read it like so here Im just saying that you know poly X poly Y and then rotation around X by the angular Theta this is basically the collection of like you know Gates that we have like you know like thats how we would call them you know in Quantum Computing and all of them are acting on the same wire on the same Quantum system uh very interesting feature that we have in our framework is called order so you can say you can specify a various specific order you can say look uh I want you know this rotation to act on the second quantum system okay so thats how you would do it you would just you know uh specify a rule and this one would say okay this rotation goes to the second system and if you look at like you know again like you know what Im doing here Im just using the shortcut for traditional form but you know on Mac is command shift t and as you can see here like you know so X is on the first after that y on the first qubit and then look you know you have rotation on the second one remember like you know unless these commute like you know the order that you are writing them like you know its very important so thats the rule of thumb like you know those of you who are new to this field remember like you know the order that youre writing all those operations are very important or another example like you know look at you know this example what Im doing here Im just saying that you know okay you know this time like you know I would like you know uh Hollywood to act on the third qubit so this time youre gonna have you know three wires for the first one we have like you know poly X second one rotation around X and the last one is what so thats how like you know we can you know uh build you know a composition of different you know Gates different you know transformation for uh our Quantum systems of course the examples that I have shown you so far like you know all these examples as you as you see like you know each of these Transformations they are acting on a single qubit you can have you know more complicated cases like you know for example like you know this is a fancy control gate which is acting simultaneously on four quantum systems at the same time basically you cannot decompose it into a you know a Chronicle product of like you know four different operations okay its acting on that whole you know space at the same time okay so your Gates your transformation they can act on a single they can act on many of them two or more at the same time and again like you know look what Im doing here Im just going with the control and then Im saying that you know the operation is X this is control one so Im just saying that like you know number one and number two if they are one acted and then this is basically control zero so like you know these are like you know the uh uh Arguments for our control gate and again like you know if you dont know how to use like you know these functionalities just just look at our documentation uh it has many examples and each of these named you know operations like you know they are explained here in detail whenever you are looking into the documentation especially for circuit operator please remember that many of the things that you see here there are actually Quantum operators so if you go here let me show it one more time and under the details you didnt see any description of the control operation it means it is under the documentation for uh Quantum operator or something just go its a long documentation so if we click on Quantum operator and here like you know you would see it like you know all these you know all of them are collection of you know control Gates that we have here so we can find like you know the detail here okay so thats thats the one that I was using and each of log you know these operations they have a full name or they have a short name like you know you can use either one uh now let me just give you like a very specific example regarding like you know what we usually call as a a Quantum algorithm for a very particular you know go I use you know a textbook example which is you know Grover Quantum search algorithm okay so the idea is like this lets say that like now we have this Boolean function which is a simple look you know the the like you know and and then not on the second one using like you know the other building functionalities in more for Mathematica you can easily find like you know what are the solutions of this Boolean function is it trivial case it is clear living room if q1 is true Q2 is false like you know you will get like you know that thats a solution you will get a true value for f okay now lets lets what is the a Quantum process for finding you know this solution okay so that Quantum process is going to be like this you would start by preparing your physical states in the ground state you would apply some Transformations and then you would do a measurement remember all of those Transformations at the end of the day they prepare a very particular Quantum state so any Quantum algorithm is like a very specific Quantum estate followed by the measurement remember like you know measurement thats the only way that we can extract information out of log in our Quantum system uh for this very particular case well you know I guess you already noticed when I was showing you the documentation for Quantum circuit operator we have a long list of you know uh name operators name circuits so these are like you know very common circuits that that we have for a very particular like you know algorithm and uh let me focus on again as I told you like thats a textbook example Global Research algorithm uh log uh maybe its early if I just show it to you that like you know we have all the completions so when you just type it like you know it shows you you know completely stuff like you know name operators that name circuits that we have I dont like lets just look at the magic wand for preparing like you know Bella State and that that thats what we have here by they were like you know all these features like you know this gray box like you know that particular composition that you may not like it to see it on the top block you know all of them look you know you can easily uh customize them using uh our uh label functionalities and just find it for second diagram its here you see like you know what I did was you know just I just search through the documentation and thats the diagram for you know Quantum framework and these are all the details all the options that we have for uh circuit visualization I know like you know many of our users are using you know Wolfram language for visualizations so like you know we have lots of options you can do a lot but but anyhow lets lets lets move on so the input the argument here is basically that Boolean function Im just saying you know look you know Im looking for Grover uh search algorithm uh this is the Boolean function and this is a circuit diagram that we have the first you know step like you know the one log analysis inside the gray boxer you know for Grover search algorithm which is usually called uh uh diffusion step for a second I I forgot about the terminology and the second piece that you see here is amplification so whats whats happening here like you know is uh practice each of them lets say that you know you are interested in uh just looking at the grover diffusion and uh oh yes so Im you know this will be functional very soon let me just make it another note of that Ill fix it very soon but anyhow you know each of these pieces let me also check if we have uh oh see is it the same case for phase diffusion oh okay I have broken that so Ill Ill fix it in a sec uh each of these pieces basically login and can extract it you see like you know the name operates was never there but lets continue so whats happening here is that you know during the first step the the gray box we are saving the information about the solution in an ancillary qubit and then in the second step we amplify the basically the amplitude of that uh that very particular uh solution okay uh the global search algorithm well you know remember login it has two uh features this is the one which is based on you know uh Boolean Oracle uh there is another one which is basically Grover uh let me show it separately foreign qubit okay so there are whenever we you know when you are looking into the literature there are two Global search algorithms one of them is the angular qubit with the other one without that in one case we are saving the solution in unsolute qubit in the other case we are saving the solution in the overall amplitude logging obviously we are adding a negative uh phase in front of like you know our our superposition uh make sure like you know you understand the difference between the two but anyhow let me just focus on you know whats Whats Happening Here so first you know I need to prepare my Quantum estate so and this is you know basically this step for preparation so what Im doing here Ill make sure that like you know the answer qubit is prepared in state one thats what like you know I added and not set here and then like you know I had hadamard you know on all of them uh to have a sort of like you know you know uniform superposition and again you know lets read like you know the code here and this is again you know one of the other things that uh By Design you know we spend so much resources making sure that you know the code is also readable not applied on the third one and then we have hadamard a collection of other mod on three qubits uh there is like instead of like you know this design you can go like somebody would say like look you know I want to do it like this I want to say like you know how the amount its acting on uh and one and two and three so thats thats the same thing okay uh again like you know this uh particular design like you know its maybe easier than this one but anyhow like you know you can use you know either one uh the second one like you know its good because sometimes you may want to act I dont know how the mod only on some specific you know qubits without and skipping some of them okay so thats all like you know giving it as an order maybe its better than just giving it you know in this form but anyhow like you know thats our preparation and now look look what Im doing here so here is basically like you know Im Im making a composition of some circuits remember this is one circuit this is another second and look how it is done Im saying that like you know the notation that we have here is just for the right composition Im just saying I dont know okay start with like you know the circuit that I call prepare and then Grover and then measure cubic number one and qubit number two and this is a circuit that I have constructed out of that so get along you know remember like you know that this is another way of like you know thinking about like the composition its literally like you know whatever operation you have as far as like you know it isnt an operation remember operation means transforming the quantum estate you can have you know their Quant you can have their like you know the composition the first one is a Quantum circuit this is a Quantum circuit this is a general measurement operator but you can you know compose them together okay so this is our circuit and now Im saying that you know okay this circuit is acting on you know uh a ground state of cubic number one through qubit number three you can save explicitly like as you can say that you know we have three Estates all of them are preparing Quantum state zero thats one way of like you know doing that or again like you know as far as you you are dealing with the register State this is sometimes what we call as a register statement by the way this is another way of you know doing exactly the same so you can say go with the register state of three qubits okay so this is the same as what we have here the same as what we have here many times like you know if you see me or you know other people that go from do coding you know in our framework you go we go with the short-term representation look anyhow do whatever way that youre more comfortable with and because we had like you know the measurements okay so the result you know is an object which is quantum measurement okay because again like you know we had you know measurement operator here you see here like you know that the the double you know horizontal line on the top thats basically a classical Warrior you know that thats the wire that youre saving you know classical information and by the way you know one more time all the labelings that you see here the label on the left the label on the right whatever you are like showing like you know the classical Warrior or not showing a classical Warrior you can customize them whatever you want you can eliminate it you can change the color you can make it brighter you can make it darker like you know you can you can do whatever you want but again lets see look you know I did you know all this operation and I did like my measurement now now the question is okay so what now lets lets look at the you know probability you know distribution so what Im saying here is you know just return the probability plot of the results and remember because we were measuring two qubits HQ by two possible you know outcomes so the potential outcomes are four of course like you know Im kind of cheating Im using a simple example that you know that shows you directly the result even go over yourself algorithmic is usually more complicated than that but anyhow look at the outcome with the largest probability here is a very special case you know I mean productive one youll get the case that q1 is in one Q two is in zero now let me remind you what was the solution the solution was the first one true the second one false one and zero and thats exactly the solution that we obtain okay so thats basically like you know a very simple you know Quantum algorithm for various specific you know objective and of course like you know there is a Hot Topic for any Quantum algorithm is like you know how much it is you know better than you know classical counterparts okay so that thats a completely different topic like you know to be honest with you you know Im not an expert on that but like you know I understand it but uh I would leave it to special like you know mathematician or you know uh computer scientists with Quantum expertise like you know they can elaborate more on that there are lots of you know uh textbook on that uh let me just mention one other thing like you know you notice you know the way that I created My overall circuit was using this fancy notation and right composition etc etc okay so you may have a different mindset you may have you know look what Im doing here at the end of the day it is also like you know a composition of bunch of circuits and the circuit number one is prepare the second number two is over and then I do measurements so why not giving them as a list inside the circuit operator yes thats you can do that you know and you would get this result the only difference is like you know in terms of you know visualization because like you know now youre feeding each one of them as a circuit we just wrap it around like you know that gray box and the label on the top like you know its basically the composition of like you know whatever you do but again like you know if you dont want to see these boxes or if you dont want to see those labels you can easily eliminate them okay like you can customize all of them and of course like you know this you know the result is going to be exactly the same as a previous one right so there are different only in terms of like you know uh visualization uh that was basically a very you know simple introduction to you know Quantum computation using our framework so the way that I want you guys to like you know those of you who are new to this field is just think about like you know a targeted state and then a very particular way of you know preparing that state keep that in mind at the very end you are always dealing with the measurement results okay so its a probabilistic like you know reasoning if if you want to think about it but thats how thats how we do it in quantum theory and by the way this is not the only Paradigm to do Quantum Computing the product that Im explaining here is what we usually call as a gate based Paradigm and majority of like you know Quantum Processing Unit the actual Quantum hardness out there there now they are claiming that like you know if we can trust another quantum but anyhow uh its a gate base uh there are some companies that are offering like you know a different approach like for example like you know like you know the d-wave you know for them is not a gate base like you know approach to do Quantum Computing uh in those cases like you know for a very particular objective you know you with design like you know hamiltonian and then like you know that hamiltonian that very particular hamiltonian would do the job for you so its a very completely different approach compared to like you know what what we have here uh in terms of like you know experimental which one is better which one is like you know I I dont know that thats a question for the experimentalism and we should wait and see like you know the monitor the progress in in experimental advancement of like you know Quantum processing units so that was basically like you know what I had prepared for today so if uh there is anything that has not been uh one more time remember like you know you just need to install the packlet after like you know installing the packet if you do not you know quit your kernel like you know the functions will be there but if you quit your kernel like you know yeah you have to basically uh install the packet every time that youre creating your own character and of course everything behind the scene is done but yeah its classical like you know we are doing a Quantum algorithm on a classical machine okay its you can by the way like you know we have we have it in your documentation if you are interested you can send your queries from a world from notebook you can get send your queries to a Quantum Processing Unit uh you can use like you know either IBM you know uh Quantum processing units you can use anything that is available on AWS and like you know uh just wait like you know get your result and then like you know do whatever processing you want to do with that
