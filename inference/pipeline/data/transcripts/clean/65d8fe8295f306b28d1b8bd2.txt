learning whats the difference are they the same well some people kind of frame the question this way its AI versus ml is that the right way to think of this or is it AI equals ml or is it AI is somehow something different than ml so heres three equations I wonder which one is going to be right well lets talk about this first of all when we talk about AI I think its important to come with definitions because a lot of people have different ideas of what this is so Im going to assert the simple definition that AI is basically exceeding or matching the capabilities of a human so were trying to match the intelligence whatever that means and capabilities of a human subject now what could that involve theres a number of different things for instance one of them is the ability to discover to find out new information another is the ability to infer to read in information from other sources that maybe has not been explicitly stated and then also the ability to reason the ability to figure things out I put this and this together and I come up with something else so Im going to suggest to you this is what AI is and thats the definition well use for this discussion now what kinds of things then would be involved if we were talking about doing machine learning well Machine learning Im going to put that over here is basically a capability well start with a Venn diagram machine learning involves predictions or decisions based on data think about this as a very sophisticated form of statistical analysis its looking for predictions based upon information that we have so the more we feed into the system the more its able to give us accurate predictions and decisions based upon that data its something that learns thats the L part rather than having to be programmed when we program a system I have to come up with all the code and if I wanted to do something different I have to go change the code and then get a different outcome in the machine learning situation what Im doing could be adjusting some models but is different than programming and mostly its learning the more data that I give to it so its based on large amounts of information and theres a couple of different fields within couple of different types there is supervised machine learning and as you might guess theres an unsupervised machine learning and the main difference as the name implies is one has more human oversight looking at the training of the data using labels that are superimposed on the data unsupervised is kind of able to run more uh and and find things that were not explicitly stated okay so thats machine learning it turns out that theres a subfield of machine learning that we call Deep learning and what is deep learning well this involves things like neural networks neural networks involve nodes and statistical relationships between those nodes to model the way that our minds work and its called Deep because were doing multiple layers of those neural networks now the interesting thing about deep learning is we can end up with some very interesting insights but we might not always be able to tell how the system came up with that it doesnt always show its work fully so we could end up with some really interesting information not know in some cases how reliable that is because we dont know exactly how it was derived but its still a very important part of all of this realm that were dealing with so those are two areas and you can see DL is a subset of ml but what about artificial intelligence where does that fit in the Venn diagram and Im going to suggest to you it is the superset of mldl and a bunch of other things what could the other of things be well we can involve things like natural language processing uh it could be vision so we want a system thats able to see we might even want a system thats able to hear and be able to distinguish what its hearing and what its seeing because after all humans are able to do that and thats part of what our brains do is distinguish those kinds of things it can involve other things like the ability to do text to speech so if we take written words Concepts and be able to speak those out so this first one involved being able to see things this is now being able to speak those things as well and then other things that humans are able to do naturally that we often take for granted is motion this is the field of Robotics which is a subset of AI the ability to just do simple things like tie our shoes open and close the door lift something walk somewhere thats all something that would be part of human capabilities and involves certain sorts of perceptions calculations that we do in our brains that we dont even think about so heres what it comes down to its a Venn diagram and weve got machine learning Weve Got Deep learning and weve got AI so Im going to suggest to you the right way to think about this is not these equations those are not the way to look at it in fact what we should think about this as machine learning is a subset of a high and thats how we need to think about this when Im doing machine learning in fact I am doing AI when Im doing these other things Im doing AI but none of them are all of AI but theyre a very important part thanks for watching please remember to like this video And subscribe to this channel so we can continue to bring you content that matters to
