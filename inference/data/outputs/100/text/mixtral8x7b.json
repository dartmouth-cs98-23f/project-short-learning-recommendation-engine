  "introduction": "In this video, we will explore the architectural differences between the vanilla transformer and the architecture of Mistral, a new language model from Mistral AI. We will discuss the sliding window attention, the kv cache, model sharding, and the code of the Mistral model. We will also briefly review the sparse mixture of experts and its related topics.",
