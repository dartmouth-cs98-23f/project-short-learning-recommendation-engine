  "introduction": "Rust is a memory-safe compiled programming language that offers high-level simplicity with low-level performance. It's popular for building systems where performance is critical, such as game engines, databases, and operating systems. Rust was initially a side project of Mozilla in 2007 and has been ranked the most loved programming language every year since 2016. In this video, we'll explore Rust's unique approach to memory management, its package manager, and its standard library.",
