  "introduction": "In this episode of the Back Engineering Show, the host discusses multithreaded applications and their role in networking and connection management, specifically focusing on TCP connections. The episode covers the basics of multithreading, its advantages and limitations, and its impact on network performance. The host also talks about different ways to manage connections and process requests using threads, including in-parallel connection acceptance and the use of proxies.",
