"introduction": "In this video, we'll discuss building a job board app that can be used as a real startup. We'll start with a minimum viable product (MVP) using an Express server, Redis for data storage, and a node cron job to fetch job data from a single data feed. We'll then create a simple frontend using React and Material UI. Our goal is to create a production-ready application in less than 100 minutes.",
