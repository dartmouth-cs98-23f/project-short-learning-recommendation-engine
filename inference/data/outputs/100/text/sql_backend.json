  "introduction": "In this video, we dive deep into the reasons why using SELECT \* is slow in a row store database engine. We explore the reasons behind this, including full table scans, deserialization costs, and network costs. We discuss how to avoid these issues by using index only scans, and how to optimize client deserialization and client building for better performance.",
