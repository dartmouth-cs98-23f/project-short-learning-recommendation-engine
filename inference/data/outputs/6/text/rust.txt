  "introduction": "Rust is a memory-safe compiled programming language that combines high-level simplicity with low-level performance. It has no garbage collector, but achieves memory safety through ownership and borrowing concepts. Rust also has a package manager called cargo and a standard library with modules for various system tasks. It is popular for building systems where performance is critical, such as game engines, databases, and operating systems.",
