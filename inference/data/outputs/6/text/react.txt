  "introduction": "React is a half-baked functional UI library created by Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook in 2013. It's a simple library that has a cool name and logo, but it has many weird ways of solving the same problems. Its killer feature is the ability to write pure functional code, but this approach can make simple things more complicated. React is a library and not a framework, and it requires finding and installing hundreds of different packages to build something cool. It has an extremely high learning curve, but it's blazingly fast and has been the most influential library in front-end development for the last decade.",
