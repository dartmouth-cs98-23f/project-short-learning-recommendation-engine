  "introduction": "The video provides an overview of direct preference optimization (DPO) as a new approach to training language models. It explains how standard training works, contrasting DPO, and provides examples of bad and good answers. The video demonstrates how DPO uses pairs of answers to bias the model away from bad answers and towards good ones.",
