  "introduction": "The video explores the reasons behind the slow performance of SELECT * queries in a row store database engine. It discusses how rows are stored in units called pages, and how reading a page involves multiple operations, including reading from disk, mapping to SSD blocks, and caching in shared memory. The video also covers the concept of shared memory and its role in query processing.",
