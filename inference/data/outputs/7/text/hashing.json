  "introduction": "The video discusses the concept of distributed systems and their importance in large-scale applications. It explains the problem of scaling a single instance and the need for distributed systems to handle the increasing size of databases. The video then introduces the concept of hashing and its role in distributed systems, specifically in resolving the intermediary problem of determining the server that hosts a given key.",
