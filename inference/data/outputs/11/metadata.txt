Prompt: Generate a JSON summary the computer science or software engineering video. The summary should include:

1. A high-level synopsis labeled as "introduction".
2. A breakdown into 5 sections, each with:
   - A title starting with "Section x" where x is the section number from 1 to 5.
   - A "content" field containing 4 bullet points summarizing the section.
   - A "topics" field listing the 3 most important topics covered in the section.
3. A global "topics" array listing 5 key descriptors (1-2 words each) of topics covered in the video.
4. A global "general topics" array selecting 3 topics from the predefined list, each associated with an exact "complexity" score based on the provided scale. The complexity score should reflect the detailed complexity level with full two-decimal-place precision.

The JSON structure should strictly follow this template:
{
  "introduction": "High level synopsis here",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Section 1",
      "content": [
        "Bullet point 1",
        "Bullet point 2",
        "Bullet point 3",
        "Bullet point 4"
      ],
      "topics": ["Topic1", "Topic2", "Topic3"]
    },
    ... (total 5 sections)
  ],
  "topics": ["Descriptor1", "Descriptor2", "Descriptor3", "Descriptor4", "Descriptor5"],
  "general topics": [
    {
      "name": "Selected general topic 1",
      "complexity": "Exact complexity score"
    },
    ... (total 3 general topics)
  ]
}

Please adhere strictly to the JSON format. Use domain-specific terminology in the "title" and "content" for each section. The "topics" and "general topics" should accurately reflect the video's content based on the predefined lists and complexity scale.
