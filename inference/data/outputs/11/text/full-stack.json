Introduction:

* The video tutorial will guide you through the process of building a job board app that could be a real startup.
* The app will use a single data feed from a job board API, with a simple frontend and backend.
* The app will filter the jobs based on their level and remove senior and manager jobs.

Section 1: Planning the Frontend

* Create a new React app and install Material UI.
* Create a new component for jobs and another for a single job.
* Use typography to hold the app state and render the jobs.
* Use variant typography to style the job list.
* Add CSS for the job component to make it a display flex.

Section 2: Building the Frontend

* Create a job list component and map it to the job data.
* Use the jobTitle and jobCompany fields to display the job details.
* Add some margin and padding to the job list.
* Style the job component using CSS.

Section 3: Setting up the Backend

* Use an Express server and Redis for data storage.
* Create a Node cron job to fetch the jobs and refresh them at a set interval.
* Filter the jobs based on their level and remove senior and manager jobs.
* Create an algorithm to filter the jobs based on their level and years of experience.

Section 4: Deploying the App

* Deploy the app on a virtual private server.
* Configure Nginx and SSL certificates for security.
* Test the app and make any necessary adjustments.
