  "introduction": "ReactJS is a half-baked functional UI library created by Facebook. It was invented by Mark Zuckerberg in 2013 and is used by millions of developers. ReactJS is simple, but it gives you dozens of weird ways to solve the same problems. Its killer feature is the ability to write pure functional code, but this can make simple things more complicated than they need to be. ReactJS is a library and not a framework, and to build something cool, you'll need to find and install hundreds of different packages. Despite its high learning curve, ReactJS is blazingly fast and has been the most influential library in front-end development for the last decade.",
