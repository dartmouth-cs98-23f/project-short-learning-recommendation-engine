"Introduction":
"In this video, we will delve into the reasons behind the slow performance of the SELECT \* statement in a relational database. We will explore the underlying concepts of page storage, file systems, and operating systems, and discuss how they impact the performance of queries involving SELECT \*."

"Section 1: Understanding Page Storage"

* Definition of pages in a relational database
* Explanation of fixed-size pages and variable-size pages
* Discussion of index pages versus heap pages

"Section 2: Reading Pages from Disk"

* Explanation of how the file system reads data from disk
* Discussion of file descriptors and starting positions
* Explanation of how page sizes affect reading performance

"Section 3: Converting Raw Bytes to File System Blocks"

* Explanation of how the file system maps raw bytes to file system blocks
* Discussion of the impact of block sizes on performance
* Explanation of how the operating system handles block mapping

"Section 4: Shared Memory and Database Caching"

* Explanation of shared memory and its role in caching database data
* Discussion of how shared memory improves query performance
* Explanation of how the database uses shared memory for caching

"Section 5: Conclusion and Future Topics"

* Summary of the key takeaways from the video
* Discussion of future topics for further exploration
* Final thoughts and recommendations
