  "introduction": "This video explores a new approach to training language models, specifically Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which is a more efficient technique compared to standard finetuning methods. DPO allows for moving the probabilities of a language model away from bad answers and towards good answers, making it easier to align models towards a chat format. The video provides examples of DPO data sets and demonstrates the training process using Hugging Face's trainer. By the end of the tutorial, viewers should be able to take a model they've developed and use DPO to align it towards a desired format.",
