  "introduction": "In this video, we will explore the architectural differences between the vanilla transformer and the architecture of mistral, a new language model from mistral ai. We will discuss the sliding window attention, the kv cache, the sparse mixture of experts model, sharding, and pipeline parallelism. Additionally, we will review the code of mistral and its innovations using the xforers library with block attention.",
