  "introduction": "The video discusses the concept of distributed systems, specifically focusing on the challenges faced when scaling large databases. It introduces the concept of hashing and its role in distributing data across multiple servers. The video then delves into the problem of determining which server to connect to when retrieving a key in a distributed environment, and presents the solution using consistent hashing.",
