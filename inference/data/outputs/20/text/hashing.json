"introduction": "In this episode of the backend engineering show, the host discusses distributed hashing and its problems, as well as the concept of consistent hashing and its potential solutions. The episode covers the basics of hashing, the limitations of traditional hashing in a distributed system, and the benefits and drawbacks of consistent hashing. The host also touches on the importance of redundancy and replication in distributed systems.",
