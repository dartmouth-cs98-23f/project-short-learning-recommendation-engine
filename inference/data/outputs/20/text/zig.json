  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of the Zig programming language, created by Andrew Kelly in 2016. It highlights Zig's minimal and fast nature, allowing for low-level memory control without managing it directly in the language. Zig has no hidden memory allocations, making code more explicit and portable. It also features a unique comp time keyword for easy runtime management. The video covers memory management, error handling, testing, and building executables.",
