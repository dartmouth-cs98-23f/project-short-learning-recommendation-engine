"title": "Section 1: Architecture of Mistral",
"content": [
"Mistral is a transformer-based language model with a sliding window attention mechanism.",
"The output of the self attention mechanism is another matrix with the same shape as the query matrix, where each token captures information about other tokens according to the mask.",
"The kv cache allows for reducing computations by only producing one output at a time."

"title": "Section 2: Sliding Window Attention",
"content": [
"Sliding window attention is a technique used to capture information about other tokens in the input sequence according to the mask.",
"The output of the self attention mechanism is a matrix with the same shape as the query matrix, where each token captures information about other tokens.",

"title": "Section 3: Chunking and Prefilling",
"content": [
"Chunking is a technique used to divide the input sequence into smaller chunks for processing.",
"Prefilling is a technique used to preprocess the input sequence by adding tokens to the kv cache before they are needed.",
"The softmax is applied after selecting the logits of the best two performing experts to ensure the weighted sum of the outputs is always one."

{
"title": "Section 4: Model Sharding",
"content": [
"Model sharding is a technique used to divide the language model into smaller parts for processing on multiple GPUs.",
"The model is divided into groups of layers, and each group is processed on a separate GPU.",
"The kv cache is used to combine all the tokens of the input sequence into one big sequence, and the actual size of each prompt is tracked for efficient processing."

{
"title": "Section 5: Innovations in Mistral",
"content": [
"Mistral uses the xFOR transformer architecture, which is an extension of the vanilla transformer.",
"The model uses the xFOR architecture to improve performance and efficiency.",
"The model also uses the xFOR architecture to enable parallel processing on multiple GPUs."
