"introduction": "In this episode of the vacuum engineering show, the host discusses the concept of distributed systems and distributed hashing. Distributed systems are a must when the scale of the database increases, but they can be challenging to manage as the number of servers increases. Distributed hashing is a technique used to solve this problem by creating a ring of servers, allowing values to be rounded up and distributed across the servers. The host discusses the benefits and drawbacks of consistent hashing, which is a popular distributed hashing technique.",
