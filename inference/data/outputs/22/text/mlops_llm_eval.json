"introduction": "This episode of the MOPS Community Podcast features a conversation with Apara, co-founder of Arise AI. Apara discusses her experience in evaluating large language models (LLMs) and the challenges and opportunities presented by this emerging field. She shares insights from her work at Uber and her current role at Arise, where she leads the product team. Apara also discusses the importance of observability in LLM systems and the role of Phoenix, an open-source package developed by Arise, in this area.",
