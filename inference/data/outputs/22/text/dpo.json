"introduction": "This video provides an introduction to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a type of reinforcement learning that moves the probabilities of a language model away from bad answers and towards good answers. DPO is more efficient than traditional techniques and is useful in aligning language models with commercial models. The video demonstrates DPO using the Tiny Lama 1 billion model and provides a step-by-step guide on how to train a model using the Hugging Face Trainer.",
