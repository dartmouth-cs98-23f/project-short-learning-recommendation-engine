  "introduction": "This video introduces containers as a lightning-fast and isolated environment for developing and deploying applications. Containers are formed with overlapping layers, allowing developers to use bleeding edge technology without conflicts. The video demonstrates how to create a container using Docker, a well-supported container platform. It also discusses Kubernetes, a platform for creating a container-based cloud.",
