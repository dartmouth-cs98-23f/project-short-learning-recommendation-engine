        "React uses a runtime called the virtual dom to track data changes and render them in the actual DOM.",
        "Svelte takes a different approach by using a compiler to eliminate the need for a runtime.",
        "Svelte's code is more concise and can be more efficient, but vanilla JavaScript libraries tend to be easier to work with in Svelte.",
