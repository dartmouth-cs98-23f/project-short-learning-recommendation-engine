  "introduction": "The video tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to building a job board app as a real startup. The app will pull job data from a single API, filter the jobs, and display them on a simple React frontend with Material UI. The app will use an Express server for data storage and a Node cron job to fetch and refresh the job feed at regular intervals. The tutorial covers the frontend development, API integration, and data filtering algorithm.",
