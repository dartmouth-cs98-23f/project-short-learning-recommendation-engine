  "introduction": "Music Zig is a high-performance system programming language that offers low-level memory control and fast performance. It uses standard library allocators for memory management and has no hidden memory allocations, making the code more explicit and portable. It also has a unique comp time keyword for running code at compile time, no preprocessor or macros, and can integrate well with C or C++ code bases. It supports cross-compilation out of the box with LLVM. The language has built-in error handling, testing framework, and supports multiple memory management strategies through defer and try keywords. It has a built-in testing framework and can be optimized for speed, size, or safety with different build modes.",
