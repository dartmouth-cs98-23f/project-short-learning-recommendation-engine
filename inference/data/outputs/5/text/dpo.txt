  "introduction": "This video introduces Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a new approach to training language models. DPO is a type of reinforcement learning that efficiently moves the probabilities of a language model away from bad answers and towards good answers. The video explains how DPO works, its differences from standard training, and provides examples of how it can be used to align a language model with a chat format.",
