  "introduction": "The video discusses the reasons behind why selecting all columns in a table, commonly referred to as 'select star', is slow in a row store database engine. It explains how rows are stored in units called pages and how reading a page involves multiple operations, including file system and SSD transfers. The video also covers the concept of shared memory and how it affects performance.",
