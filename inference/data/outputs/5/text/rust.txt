  "introduction": "Rust is a memory-safe compiled programming language that combines high-level simplicity with low-level performance. It has no garbage collector and achieves memory safety through ownership and borrowing concepts. Rust also has a package manager called cargo and a standard library for handling various tasks. It is popular for building systems where performance is critical, such as game engines, databases, and operating systems. Rust is known for its safety, speed, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for webAssembly development. It has been ranked the most loved programming language every year since 2016 and has a strong community of developers known as 'rust stations'.",
