  "introduction": "The video discusses the concept of distributed systems and how they are used to handle large-scale databases. It introduces the problem of determining which server to connect to in a distributed environment based on a key, and how hashing can solve this problem. The video also covers the concept of consistent hashing and its limitations.",
