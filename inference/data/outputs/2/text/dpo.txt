        "Standard language model training involves penalizing the model to predict bad answers. It is a statistical approach where language models are trained to predict the next token based on the frequency of information in the training dataset.",
        "The relative frequency of correct answers can be increased to bias the model towards better answers.",
        "An example is given where doublin is the next token 10 times, and cork is the next token one time. The language model is more likely to predict dublin due to its greater frequency.",
        "In contrast, standard training only uses actual token predictions for comparison and does not allow for biasing based on other options."

        "Direct preference optimization (DPO) is an approach to language model training where a chosen response and a rejected response are used to penalize the model.",
        "The chosen and rejected responses are compared to the reference model to incentivize the probability of the chosen answer and decrease the probability of the rejected answer.",
        "An example is given where the capital of Arland is used as the input. The chosen response is dublin, and the rejected response is cork. The model is penalized to increase the probability of dublin and decrease the probability of cork relative to the reference model.",
        "DPO allows for more nuanced interaction with the model by using pairs of options for penalty and incentive."
