        "Hash tables use arrays as a data structure for fast retrieval of values based on a key.",
        "The power of hash tables lies in the use of a one-way function to convert the key into an index.",
        "The size of the array changes when the hash table size changes, which can lead to problems when distributing the system.",

      "content": [
        "Consistency hashing is a technique used to distribute data across multiple servers while maintaining consistency.",
        "The algorithm works by mapping each key to a virtual ring with a fixed number of slots.",
        "When a new server is added, the algorithm determines which slot in the ring the new server should occupy based on the existing keys.",
        "Consistency hashing is particularly useful for handling large amounts of data and minimizing the number of server-to-server communications."

      "content": [
        "While consistency hashing is effective for distributing data across multiple servers, it has some limitations.",
        "One major limitation is the need to move data around when adding or removing servers, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.",
        "Another limitation is the potential for collisions, where multiple keys are mapped to the same slot in the virtual ring.",
        "To mitigate these limitations, techniques such as replication and load balancing can be used."

      "content": [
        "Replication involves creating multiple copies of the same data to ensure availability and fault tolerance.",
        "Load balancing distributes the workload across multiple servers to improve performance and scalability.",
        "In the context of consistency hashing, replication can be used to handle collisions and ensure data consistency across multiple servers.",

        "Understanding the principles of consistency hashing and its limitations is essential for designing and implementing scalable and fault-tolerant systems.",
        "By leveraging the power of these techniques, developers can create systems that can handle large amounts of data and provide fast and reliable access to that data."
