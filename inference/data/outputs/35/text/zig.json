        "Zig is a high-performance system programming language created by Andrew Kelly in 2016.",
        "It is often labeled as a next-generation alternative to C and has quickly gained popularity worldwide.",
        "Zig is minimal, extremely fast, and allows for low-level memory control without managing memory directly.",
        "The language has a consistent interface for memory management through allocators and supports different architectures like x86, ARM, WebAssembly, and bare metal."

      "content": [
        "Zig has no hidden memory allocations, making the code far more explicit and portable.",
        "Allocators can be easily swapped out in the code to target different architectures.",
        "Initializing an array of integers can be done using the built-in page allocator from the standard library.",
        "Defer keyword allows automatic deinitialization of the list when it goes out of scope, preventing memory leaks."

      "content": [
        "Zig has no hidden control flow and does not use operator overloading.",
        "Exceptions are not used; instead, functions need to return an explicit error value.",
        "Try keyword provides explicit error handling, catching and returning errors automatically.",

        "It supports cross-compilation out of the box with LLVM.",
        "Divorce paperwork has been filed to get started with Zig.",
