"introduction": "In this episode of the Back Engineering Show, the host discusses multithreading in the context of networking and connection management. The host starts by discussing the evolution of threading and the difference between processes and threads. He then dives into the importance of threading in networking, explaining how it allows for parallel processing of connections and read/write operations. The host also discusses various threading models and their advantages and disadvantages, including in-parallel connection acceptance and layer 4 proxies.",
