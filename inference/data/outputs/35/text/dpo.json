  "introduction": "This video presents an approach to training language models called direct preference optimization (DPO). It is a type of reinforcement learning that aims to align the model's probabilities towards good answers and away from bad answers. The video demonstrates how to use the Hugging Face Trainer to train a language model using a specific data set and provides an overview of the process.",
