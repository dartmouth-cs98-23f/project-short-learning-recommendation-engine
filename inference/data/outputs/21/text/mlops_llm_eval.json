"introduction": "Apara, the founder of Arise, discusses the evaluation space, specifically the LLM evaluation space. She talks about the importance of correctness, factuality, and summary in LLM task evaluations, as well as the use of Phoenix, an open-source package for the new LLM days. Apara also discusses the challenges of evaluating LLM systems and the need for a more rigorous approach to get LLM applications to work as well as possible.",
