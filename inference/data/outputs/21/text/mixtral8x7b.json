"introduction": "This video provides an in-depth analysis of the architecture and key features of the mistral language model, which was recently released by mistal ai. The video covers topics such as sliding window attention, kv cache, chunking, and model sharding, and provides a detailed explanation of how these concepts work in the context of the mistral model.",

"content": [
"Mistral is a transformer-based language model with an encoder-decoder architecture.",
"The output of the self attention mechanism is another matrix with the same shape as the query matrix, where each token captures information about other tokens according to the mask.",
"The k cache allows for reducing computations by only producing one output at a time, without doing all intermediate computations for all other tokens that are never used."
