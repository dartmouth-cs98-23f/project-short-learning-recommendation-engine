"introduction": "In this video, we will be discussing building a job board app that can be used as a real startup. We will start with an MVP that consists of a single data feed from a job board API. We will use React, Material UI, and Node.js with Redis for data storage. We will also use a cron job to fetch jobs and refresh them at a certain interval. The app will filter down jobs to get only junior software engineer positions.",
