"introduction": "This video introduces Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a technique for training language models to bias their answers towards good answers rather than bad answers. DPO is a type of reinforcement learning that uses pairs of answers to penalize the model for bad answers and incentivize it for good answers. The goal is to pull the model away from giving out dangerous answers and towards more harmless and aligned responses.",
