  "introduction": "In this video, we'll discuss building a job board app that can be used as a real startup. We'll start with a minimum viable product (MVP) using a single data feed from a job board API, a simple front end with React and Material UI, and an Express server with Redis for data storage. We'll fetch jobs from the API, filter them, and display them in our app. Our goal is to create a production application in less than 100 minutes.",
