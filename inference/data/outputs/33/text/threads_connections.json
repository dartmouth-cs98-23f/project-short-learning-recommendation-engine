  "introduction": "In this episode of the Back Engineering Show, the host discusses the importance of multithreading in networking and connection management within the context of TCP connection management. The host covers the concept of multithreading, its role in socket management, and how it affects connection acceptance and processing. The video also highlights the simplicity of having a single thread handle everything, but the drawbacks of not scaling horizontally.",
