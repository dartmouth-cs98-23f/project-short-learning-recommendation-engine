  "introduction": "In this video, we explore the architectural differences between the vanilla transformer and the architecture of mistral, a new language model from mistral AI. We discuss the sliding window attention and its relation to the concept of receptive field, the kv cache and rolling buffer cache, sparse mixture of experts model sharding, and model sharding. We also review the self-attention mechanism and how it is applied to the input for the temp step. Finally, we provide an overview of the code of mistral and its innovations, especially when using the xforers library with the block attention.",
