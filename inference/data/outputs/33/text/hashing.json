  "introduction": "In this video, the concept of distributed systems and distributed databases is discussed, specifically focusing on the use of consistent hashing to distribute large data sets across multiple servers. The video covers the basics of consistent hashing, its benefits, and the challenges that arise when implementing it in practice. It also touches on the importance of replication, backup, and disaster recovery in distributed systems.",
