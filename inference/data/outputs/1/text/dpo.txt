  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its role in training language models more efficiently and towards a chat format. The host explains how standard language model training involves penalizing the model based on predicted next tokens versus actual next tokens, while DPO moves the model probabilities towards the desired answer. This difference between standard training and DPO is demonstrated via examples and an explanation of how to generate reference models during the DPO process.",

        "Language models are statistical models that learn from the frequency of information in a training data set.",

        "Generating more data with the same input is preferred over adding new inputs to increase the frequency of a specific word.",
