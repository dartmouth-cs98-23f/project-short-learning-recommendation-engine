          "Mutable values are stored in heap memory, allowing larger objects or values.",
          "Variables in Rust are assigned to a single owner with automatic memory release when the owner goes out of scope.",
          "Borrowing allows access to a reference without taking ownership in some cases."

    "conclusion": "In summary, Rust is a memory-safe, high-performance programming language suitable for building complex systems. Its ownership and borrowing system, combined with automatic memory management, provides absolute control over performance and memory safety. Rust also has a strong focus on safety, making it a popular choice for systems targeting WebAssembly."
