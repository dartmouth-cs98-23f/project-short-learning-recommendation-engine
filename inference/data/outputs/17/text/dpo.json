  "introduction": "This video provides an introduction to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a more efficient approach to training language models that aligns the model's probabilities away from bad answers and towards good answers. The video demonstrates how to use DPO to train a language model on the Tiny Lama dataset, a 1 billion parameter model. It also explains the differences between DPO and standard training techniques and provides an overview of the DPO training process.",
