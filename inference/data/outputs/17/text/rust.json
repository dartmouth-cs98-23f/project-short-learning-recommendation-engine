  "introduction": "Rust is a memory-safe compiled programming language that delivers high-level simplicity with low-level performance. It is popular for building systems where performance is critical, such as game engines, databases, or operating systems. Rust was started as a side project of Mozilla in 2007 and has been ranked the most loved programming language every year since 2016. Its fans are known as 'rust stations'. Rust takes a different approach to memory management by using ownership and borrowing concepts, which achieve memory safety without a garbage collector. This video provides an overview of Rust's features and how to get started with the language.",
