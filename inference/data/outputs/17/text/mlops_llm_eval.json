"introduction": "In this episode, we dive into the world of evaluation in the LLM (Language Model) space. Our guest, Apara, shares her insights and experiences in this rapidly evolving field, discussing topics such as correctness, factuality, and the importance of observability in LLM evaluation. We also explore the role of open source tools like Phoenix in providing visibility into the full stack traces of LLM applications and the need for rigorous evaluation to ensure successful deployment and scalability.",
