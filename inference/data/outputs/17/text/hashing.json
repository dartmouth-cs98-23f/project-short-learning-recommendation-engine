"content": [
"Server failures can cause data inconsistencies and affect the performance of the distributed system.",
"To handle server failures, distributed systems can use techniques such as replication and backup.",
"Replication involves maintaining multiple copies of the data on different servers, ensuring that data is available even if one server fails.",
"Backup involves periodically copying the data to a backup server, allowing for quick recovery in case of a failure."
