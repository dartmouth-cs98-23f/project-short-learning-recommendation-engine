  "introduction": "Zig is a high-performance system programming language created by Andrew Kelly in 2016. It is often labeled as a next-generation alternative to C. This video provides an overview of Zig's key features, including its minimal and fast nature, low-level memory control, explicit error handling, and cross-platform compatibility.",
