  "introduction": "This video discusses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for training language models. It explains how DPO works by penalizing the model to incentivize the probability of the model being trained increasing for good answers relative to bad ones. The video provides an example of using DPO on a harmful instruction set and shows the improvement in the model's output after training.",
