  "introduction": "This video provides a step-by-step guide to building a job board app using a minimum viable product (MVP) approach. The MVP consists of a single data feed from a job board API, a super minimal simple front end using React and Material UI, an Express server for data storage, and a node cron job for fetching and refreshing jobs at a certain interval. The app will filter jobs through an algorithm to display only entry-level positions.",
