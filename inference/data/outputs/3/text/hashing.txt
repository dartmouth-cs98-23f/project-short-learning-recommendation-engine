{"introduction": "The video explains the concept of hash tables, memory, and distributed systems. Hash tables use arrays and hash functions to efficiently retrieve values based on keys, with no seek time required. However, this approach may not be scalable for large databases, and problems can arise when the size of the array changes. The video explores the challenges of distributing large databases across multiple servers and introducing a hashing function to address this problem.", "sections": [
