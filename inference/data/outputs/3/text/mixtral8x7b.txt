  "introduction": "Welcome back to the video, as today we will be discussing the new language model called Mistra from Mistral AI, a recent unicorn startup in Europe for language models. The video will cover various topics related to the architectural differences between the vanilla transformer and Mistral, introducing the sliding window attention, kv cache, sparse mixture of experts model, sharding, pipeline parallelism, and coding the Mistral system. It also presents a brief overview of the main topics that will be covered in additional sections. It's important to have a strong understanding of the transformer model and the attention mechanism, particularly the self-attention, before watching this video. Since this content is quite advanced, it's essential to be familiar with the topics before proceeding.",
