"introduction": "This video provides an introduction to a new approach to training language models called Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The video explains the basics of language model training, contrasts it with DPO, provides examples of language datasets, and walks through the implementation of DPO using the Hugging Face Trainer. The video intends to help developers understand how to align the probabilities of a language model to a desired output format.",
