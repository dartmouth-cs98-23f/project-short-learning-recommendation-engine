  "introduction": "In this video, the speaker discusses building a job board app as a real startup that aggregates entry-level developer jobs from various sources. The app will have a single data feed from a job board API, a minimal front-end using React and Material UI, and an Express server with Redis for data storage. The app will use a cron job to fetch jobs and refresh them at a certain interval, filtering them through an algorithm. The speaker demonstrates how to create the app in less than 100 minutes, including deploying it to the public internet.",
