  "introduction": "Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a type of reinforcement learning used to train language models. It focuses on moving the model's probabilities towards good answers and away from bad ones. The video provides an overview of DPO, its differences from standard finetuning, and two data sets used for training. It also showcases the process of installing packages, loading the model, and running the DPO training.",
