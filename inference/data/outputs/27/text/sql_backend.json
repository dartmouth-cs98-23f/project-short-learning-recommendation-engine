  "introduction": "This video discusses the reasons why selecting all columns in a table, commonly referred to as 'select star', can be slow in a row store database engine. The video covers various aspects, including full table scans, deserialization cost, and network cost. It also highlights the importance of understanding the entire stack and backend engineering fundamentals, especially the network aspects, in order to optimize performance.",
