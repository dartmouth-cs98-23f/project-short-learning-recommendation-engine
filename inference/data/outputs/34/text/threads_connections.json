  "introduction": "In this episode of the Back Engineering Show, the host discusses multithreading and its importance in networking and connection management, specifically in the context of TCP connections. The episode starts with a brief overview of multithreading and its evolution in computing. The host then dives into the topic of socket management and connection management, focusing on the limitations of single-threaded applications like Node.js. The episode concludes with a discussion on the benefits of multithreading and its impact on application performance and scalability.",
