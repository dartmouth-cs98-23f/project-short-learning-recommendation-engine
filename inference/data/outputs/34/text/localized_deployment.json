  "introduction": "In this video, we explore containers as a way to develop and deploy applications. Containers are isolated environments that are created in mere moments, providing developers with a fast and efficient way to develop and deploy applications. We discuss how containers work, how they can be created and managed, and their benefits compared to traditional virtual machines.",
