  "introduction": "In this video, we dive into the reasons why selecting all columns in a table, commonly referred to as 'select star', is slow in a row store database engine. We discuss the impact of full table scans, index only scans, deserialization cost, and network latency on query performance. We also explore the concept of lazy parsing and how it can improve performance.",
