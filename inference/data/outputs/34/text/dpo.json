"introduction": "This video provides an overview of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a type of reinforcement learning used to train language models. It explains the process of moving the probabilities of a model away from bad answers and towards good answers, with a focus on safety and avoiding harmful results. The video uses a specific data set for demonstration and provides a step-by-step guide to training a language model using DPO.",
