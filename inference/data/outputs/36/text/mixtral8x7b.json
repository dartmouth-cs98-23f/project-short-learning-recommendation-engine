  "introduction": "In this video, we explore the new language model called Mistral from Mistral AI, which has recently become a unicorn in Europe. We discuss the architectural differences between the vanilla transformer and the architecture of Mistral. We also examine the sliding window attention, the kv cache, model sharding, and sparse mixture of experts. We provide a code review of the Mistral model and discuss its implementation in the code. The video covers the prompt generation process and how to prefill the kv cache using the tokens of the prompt. We also discuss the importance of understanding the attention mask when working with multiple prompts. The video provides valuable insights into the inner workings of the Mistral model and its implementation in software development.",
