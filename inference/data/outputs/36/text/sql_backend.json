  "introduction": "This video discusses the reasons behind the slow performance of SELECT \* statements in SQL databases. It covers the impact of full table scans, index only scans, and the limitations of having an unlimited number of columns. The video also talks about the need for efficient data transfer and the importance of lazy data retrieval to minimize network latency.",
