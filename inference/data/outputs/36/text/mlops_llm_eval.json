  "introduction": "This video focuses on a virtual conference that will take place on February 15th and 16th. The conference features an impressive lineup of guests, including AI experts, product owners, and engineers. The conference includes keynotes, workshops, and a product owner track. The video discusses the recommendation component of the chat application, which uses both structured extraction and internal recommendation models. It also mentions a benchmarking technique called 'needle in a haystack' and the importance of evaluating outcomes and customizing evaluations. The video highlights the need for fast evaluation and the importance of setting up the right evaluation methods.",
