        "React and Svelte have different ways of handling conditional logic, with React using nested ternaries and Svelte using if statements.",
        "React and Svelte can use loops, but Svelte has a more efficient way of handling arrays with key loops.",

        "React and Svelte can handle async data with promises and suspense, respectively.",
        "Svelte has a simpler way of handling shared state and async data with reactive declarations.",

        "Ultimately, the choice between React and Svelte depends on the specific needs and preferences of the developer or team.",
