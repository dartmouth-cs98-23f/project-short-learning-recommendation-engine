  "introduction": "In this video, we discuss the concept of consistency hashing, a powerful algorithm used to distribute data across multiple servers. The video covers the basics of hash functions, ring-based data distribution, and the challenges of adding or removing servers in a distributed system. We also explore the importance of replication and data backup in ensuring system reliability.",
