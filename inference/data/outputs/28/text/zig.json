  "introduction": "This video provides a brief overview of the Zig programming language, created by Andrew Kelly in 2016. It is a high-performance system programming language often labeled as a next-generation alternative to C. Zig is minimal, extremely fast, and allows for low-level memory control. It has a unique comp time keyword that makes it trivial to run code at kodak compile time instead of runtime. Zig also integrates well into a C or C++ code base and supports cross compilation out of the box with LLVM. This video covers memory management, error handling, testing, and building executables in Zig.",
