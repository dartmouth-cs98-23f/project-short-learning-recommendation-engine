  "introduction": "The video discusses the differences between React and Svelte, two popular JavaScript frameworks used for building web applications. Both frameworks help developers build reactive user interfaces with JavaScript by organizing code into reusable components. However, they differ in their approach to rendering, component state, props, side effects, and computed state. The video also mentions the use of Svelte's slots system and its ability to handle async functions, making it more reliable than React in some cases.",

        "React uses a runtime called the virtual dom to keep track of data changes in the application and render them in the actual DOM in the browser. This runtime requires some initial JavaScript and has a baseline of around 70 kilobytes.",
        "Svelte takes a different approach by using a compiler to eliminate the need for a runtime. It takes your Svelte code and converts it into vanilla JavaScript, resulting in a smaller hello world.",
        "React is just JavaScript, whereas Svelte can take non-JavaScript code to allow developers to do things more efficiently.",
        "Vanilla JavaScript libraries tend to be much easier to work with in Svelte compared to React."

        "Svelte defines the logic within the script tags to create reactive state and allows you to define a function on the click event that mutates the value directly.",
        "Svelte's code is able to be more concise because it doesn't require any imports or function calls to initialize the state.",
        "React allows you to pass components as props and render them directly in the JSX."

        "Svelte uses reactive declarations that start with a dollar sign and a colon to rerun the code whenever any dependent data changes.",
        "Svelte automatically knows to only run the code when the count changes, making it more reliable than React.",
