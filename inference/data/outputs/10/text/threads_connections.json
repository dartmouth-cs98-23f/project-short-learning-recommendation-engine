  "introduction": "In this episode of the Back Engineering Show, we delve into the topic of threading and multithreading in backend applications, specifically within the context of networking and connection management. We explore the concept of CPU and I/O bound processes and the importance of understanding the nature of your backend. We also discuss the evolution of CPUs and how multiple cores and threads have improved performance in modern systems. Finally, we touch on the challenges and downsides of multithreading, including resource management and thread access issues.",
