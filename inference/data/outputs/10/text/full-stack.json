Introduction:

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of building a job board application that can serve as a real startup platform for entry-level or junior developer positions. We will start with a simple minimum viable product (MVP) that pulls data from a single job board API, and then we will gradually add more features and complexity to the application.

Section 1: Setting up the Frontend

* Creating a new React app in the 'junior dev' directory using 'create-react-app'
* Installing Material UI for styling the frontend
* Creating a new component for jobs and another component for a single job
* Importing React, Material UI, and default functions
* Using typography for the page title
* Implementing variant typography
* Naming the page 'Entry Level Software Jobs'
* Styling the job list component with CSS
* Adding margin and padding to the job list component
* Collapsing the client for now and returning to it later after completing the full stack development

Section 2: Setting up the Backend

* Using Express and Redis for the backend
* Creating a Node cron job to fetch job data from multiple job board APIs
* Filtering the job data using an algorithm
* Creating search indexes and other features for advanced filtering
* Using the API provided by Github jobs as an example
* Manipulating the JSON representation of the jobs using the Node worker
* Storing the filtered job data in Redis
* Refreshing the data at a set interval (e.g., every hour)

Section 3: Setting up the Database

* Using Redis as the database for the job board application
* Storing the filtered job data in Redis
* Using the Node worker to fetch job data from multiple job board APIs
* Filtering the job data using an algorithm
* Creating search indexes and other features for advanced filtering

Section 4: Deployment and Testing

* Deploying the job board application on a virtual private server
* Configuring Nginx and SSL certificates for security
* Testing the application thoroughly
* Refining the application based on user feedback

Topics:

* React
* Material UI
* Express
* Redis
* Node cron job
* Job board APIs
* Algorithm
* Search indexes
* Github jobs
* Full stack development
* Database
* Deployment
* Testing

General Topics:

* Web development and internet technologies
* Software engineering and system design
* Data science and analytics
