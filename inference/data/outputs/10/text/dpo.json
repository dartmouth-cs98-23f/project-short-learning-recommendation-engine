  "introduction": "This video provides an introduction to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a technique used to train language models. DPO is a more efficient type of reinforcement learning compared to standard finetuning techniques used by companies like Open AI and Meta. The video explains how DPO works and how it can be used to align language models with a chat format in a way that is complementary to standard finetuning.",
