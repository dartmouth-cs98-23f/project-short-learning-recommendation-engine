  "introduction": "The video provides an overview of the architecture of the language model Mistral, focusing on its differences compared to the vanilla transformer model. It discusses the use of sliding window attention, the kv cache, and the sparse mixture of experts model, as well as the feedforward layer and the group query attention. The video also introduces the concept of the encoder and decoder blocks in the transformer model.",
