  "introduction": "In this episode of the Back Engineering Show, we dive into the topic of threading in multithreaded applications, specifically within the context of networking and connection management. We discuss the importance of understanding the nature of your backend and whether it costs CPU or I/O, as well as the evolution of CPUs and the ability to add multiple cores. We also explore the benefits and challenges of multithreading and the management of threads and resource access.",
