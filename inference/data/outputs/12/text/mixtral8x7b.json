  "introduction": "In this video, we explore the architecture differences between the vanilla transformer and Mistral, a new language model from Mistral AI. We discuss the sliding window attention, kv cache, sparse mixture of experts model, sharding, and pipeline parallelism. We also provide a code review of Mistral's implementation using the Xformers library.",
