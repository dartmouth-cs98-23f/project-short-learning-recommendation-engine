  "introduction": "In this episode, we have a conversation with Apara, Chief Product Officer at Arise AI, about evaluating LLM systems. Apara discusses the importance of evaluating not only the output but also the retrieval process, and the potential use of LLMs as a judge. She also shares her insights on finetuning and traditional ML, and how traditional ML engineers might jump to f-tuning. Apara also shares her story about moving from Spain to Germany and how she ended up in the evaluation space.",
