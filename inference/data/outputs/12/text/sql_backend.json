  "introduction": "In this video, we dive deep into the reasons why selecting all columns with the SQL command 'SELECT *' can be slow. We discuss the page-based structure of databases, the file system, and the operating system, and how reading pages from disk involves multiple operations. We also explore how the database cache, known as shared buffers, can improve performance.",
