  "introduction": "The video tutorial provides an overview of building a job board app as a real startup. The plan involves starting with a single data feed from a job board API, creating a minimal frontend using React and Material UI, and implementing an algorithm to filter job listings. The app will use an Express server for data storage and a Node cron job to fetch and refresh jobs at regular intervals.",
