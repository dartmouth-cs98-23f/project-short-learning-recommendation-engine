  "introduction": "Rust is a memory-safe compiled programming language that provides high-level simplicity with low-level performance. It is popular for building systems where performance is critical, such as game engines, databases, and operating systems. Rust takes a unique approach to memory management by using ownership and borrowing concepts, which allow for absolute control over performance while keeping code safe. This video provides an overview of Rust, its package manager Cargo, and its standard library modules.",
