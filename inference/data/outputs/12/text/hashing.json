  "introduction": "In this episode of the Vacancy Engineering Show, the concept of distributed systems is discussed, focusing on the problems that arise when a database grows too large and cannot be managed on a single instance. The show explores the concept of hashing and how it can be used to distribute data across multiple servers, allowing for more efficient querying and better performance.",
