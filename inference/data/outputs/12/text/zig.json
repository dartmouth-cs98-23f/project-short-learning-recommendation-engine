  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of the Zig programming language, created by Andrew Kelly in 2016. Zig is a high-performance system programming language that is often labeled as the next generation alternative to C. It is minimal, extremely fast, and allows for low-level memory control. Zig has no hidden memory allocations, making the code far more explicit and portable. It also has no hidden control flow, no operator overloading, and doesn't even have exceptions. Zig has a unique comp time keyword that makes it trivial to run code at compile time instead of runtime. It integrates well into a C or C++ code base and supports cross compilation out of the box with LLVM. This video covers the basics of Zig programming and its unique features.",
