  "introduction": "The video discusses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a technique for language model training that improves the probability of good answers compared to bad ones. DPO uses pairs of options and penalizes the model to incentivize the probability of the chosen answer and reduce the probability of the rejected answer.",
