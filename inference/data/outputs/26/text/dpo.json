  "introduction": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a type of reinforcement learning that aims to move the probabilities of a language model away from bad answers and towards good answers. This approach is more efficient than traditional methods and focuses on achieving a level of safety and avoiding harmful results. The video demonstrates how to train a language model using DPO and provides examples of how the model's performance can improve over time.",
