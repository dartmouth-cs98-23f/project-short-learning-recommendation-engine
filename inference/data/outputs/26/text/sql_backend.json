  "introduction": "This video discusses the performance implications of using SELECT \* in a relational database. The author explains how SELECT \* can negatively impact performance due to various reasons, including full table scans, deserialization costs, and network latency. The video provides examples and explanations for each of these reasons and suggests ways to improve performance when querying large datasets.",
