        "Zig was created by Andrew Kelly in 2016 and has evolved into a popular new language.",
        "It is minimal, fast, and allows for low-level memory control but doesn't manage memory directly like C.",
        "Zig uses allocators from the standard library for memory management, which can be easily swapped out to target different architectures.",
        "Zig doesn't have hidden control flow, operator overloading, or exceptions; instead, it uses explicit error values."

        "Allocation and deallocation of memory can be done using the built-in page allocator.",
        "Memory can be swapped out with other allocators to use different memory management strategies.",

        "Try keyword provides explicit error handling for functions that might fail.",
        "Error values can be caught and returned to make the code more reliable.",
