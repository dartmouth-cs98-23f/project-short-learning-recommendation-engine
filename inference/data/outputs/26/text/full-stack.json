  "introduction": "In this video, we'll explore how to build a job board app that can be used as a real startup. We'll start with a minimum viable product (MVP) that pulls data from a single job board API and displays it in a simple front end. We'll use React and Material UI for the front end, an Express server for the backend, Redis for data storage, and a node cron job to fetch and refresh job data at regular intervals.",
