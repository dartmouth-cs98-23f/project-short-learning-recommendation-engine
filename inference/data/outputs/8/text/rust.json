  "introduction": "Rust is a memory-safe compiled programming language that offers high-level simplicity with low-level performance. It was initially developed as a side project by Mozilla in 2007 and has since become the most loved programming language. Rust has no garbage collector but achieves memory safety through ownership and borrowing concepts. It also has a package manager called Cargo for easy installation and a standard library for handling I/O, file systems, concurrency, and more. Rust is an excellent choice for building systems where performance is critical, such as game engines, databases, or operating systems.",
