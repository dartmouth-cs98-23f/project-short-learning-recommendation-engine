  "introduction": "Music Zig is a high-performance system programming language created by Andrew Kelly in 2016. It is designed to be minimal, fast, and allow for low-level memory control. The language has a unique comp time keyword that makes it easy to run code at compile time, and it supports cross-compilation out of the box with LLVM. It also has a built-in testing framework and a defer keyword for automatic memory management.",
