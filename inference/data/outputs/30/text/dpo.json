  "introduction": "This video introduces Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as a more efficient type of reinforcement learning for training language models. DPO aims to align the model probabilities towards good answers, moving away from bad answers. The video provides an overview of DPO, its differences from standard finetuning, and the use of two data sets: one for training and one for evaluation. It also demonstrates the installation and loading of the model for finetuning and evaluation.",
