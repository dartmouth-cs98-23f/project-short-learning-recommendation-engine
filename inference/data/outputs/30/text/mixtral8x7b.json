  "introduction": "In this video, we explore the architectural differences between the vanilla transformer and the architecture of mistral, a new language model from mistral ai. We discuss the sliding window attention, the kv cache, model sharding, and the code of the mistral model. We also touch on the concept of rolling buffer cache and prefilling.",
