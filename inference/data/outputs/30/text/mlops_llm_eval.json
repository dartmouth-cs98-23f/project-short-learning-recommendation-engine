  "introduction": "This video discusses a virtual conference that will take place on February 15th and 22nd. The conference features an AI product owner track, an engineering track, and hands-on workshops. Some of the keynote speakers include Jason Louie, Shrea Shanar, Tunji, and Golden. The conference also focuses on AI ethics, particularly in terms of evaluating the responses and individual span levels of AI models. The video emphasizes the importance of getting stuff out as fast as possible and evaluating the outcomes.",
