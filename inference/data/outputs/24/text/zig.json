        "Zig was created by Andrew Kelly in 2016 and has become one of the most desired new languages in the world.",
        "Zig is a minimal, extremely fast language that allows for low-level memory control.",
        "Zig has a unique comp time keyword that makes it trivial to run code at compile time.",
        "Zig can integrate well into a C or C++ code base and supports cross compilation out of the box with LLVM."

        "Zig uses allocators to provide a consistent interface for memory management.",
        "Allocators can be easily swapped out in the code to target different architectures like x86, ARM, WebAssembly, and bare metal.",
        "Zig has no hidden memory allocations, making the code far more explicit and portable.",

      "content": [
        "Zig does not have hidden control flow or operator overloading.",
        "Exceptions are not used in Zig; instead, functions need to return explicit error values.",
        "Try keyword provides explicit error handling that catches and returns errors automatically.",

        "Initializing an array of integers can be done using a built-in page allocator from the standard library.",
        "Swapping out allocators for different memory management strategies is possible in Zig.",
