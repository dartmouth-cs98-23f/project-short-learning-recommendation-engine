  "introduction": "This episode of the Back Engineering Show discusses threading and multithreading in the context of networking and connection management, specifically focusing on TCP connection management in backend applications. The video covers the history of threading and its evolution, the difference between processes and threads, and the role of threads in handling connections and processing requests in a web application. The episode also explores various models for connection acceptance and processing, including in-parallel and scattershot approaches.",
