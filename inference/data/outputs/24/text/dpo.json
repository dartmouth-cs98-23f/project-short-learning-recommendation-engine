  "introduction": "This video introduces Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a type of reinforcement learning used to train language models. DPO aims to move the model probabilities away from bad answers and towards good answers, focusing on a chat format that is aligned with commercial models. The video covers two DPO data sets and provides a step-by-step guide to training a model using the Hugging Face Trainer.",
