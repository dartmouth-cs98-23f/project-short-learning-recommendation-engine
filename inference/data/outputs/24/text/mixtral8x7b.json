  "introduction": "This video discusses the architectural differences between the vanilla transformer and the Mistral language model from Mistral AI. It explores the sliding window attention mechanism, the kv cache, model sharding, and the code of the Mistral model. The video also covers the concept of rolling buffer cache and prefilling with chunking. The video is intended for beginners and provides an in-depth understanding of the inner workings of the Mistral model.",
