  "introduction": "In this video, we discuss the concept of hash tables and their practical applications. Hash tables use arrays as a common data structure to provide fast retrieval of values based on their keys. However, when the size of the array changes, the hash table size must also change, leading to the need for distributed systems and intermediaries to manage key-value pairs. The video also covers consistency hashing, replication, and the limitations of distributed systems.",
