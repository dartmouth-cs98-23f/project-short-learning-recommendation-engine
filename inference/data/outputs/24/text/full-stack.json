  "introduction": "In this video, we will guide you through building a job board application that can be a real startup. We will start with an MVP that uses a single data feed from a job board API, a super minimal simple frontend using React and Material UI, an Express server for data storage, and a node cron job to fetch and refresh jobs. We will discuss the challenges of filtering through various job boards and how to access redis through our node worker. We will also cover the process of deploying our app and the importance of adding more data feeds and improving the algorithm for a full production launch.",
