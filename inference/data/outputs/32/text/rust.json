  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of Rust, a memory-safe compiled programming language that offers high-level simplicity with low-level performance. Rust was initially developed as a side project by GreatOwl in 2007 and later sponsored by Mozilla in 2009. It has been ranked as the most loved programming language every year since 2016 and is particularly suitable for building systems where performance is critical, such as game engines, databases, and operating systems. Rust also excels when targeting WebAssembly.",
