  "introduction": "Rust is a memory-safe compiled programming language that delivers high-level simplicity with low-level performance. It is popular for building systems where performance is critical, like game engines, databases, and operating systems. Rust started as a side project of Mozilla in 2007 and has been ranked the most loved programming language every year since 2016. This video provides an overview of Rust's features, including its ownership and borrowing system, package manager Cargo, and standard library.",
