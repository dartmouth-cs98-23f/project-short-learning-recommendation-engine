  "introduction": "This video introduces Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a technique used to align a language model's probabilities towards good answers rather than bad ones. DPO is a more efficient form of reinforcement learning compared to standard training methods and is useful in developing chat-formatted language models. The video demonstrates two DPO data sets and provides a step-by-step guide on how to train a model using the Hugging Face Trainer.",
