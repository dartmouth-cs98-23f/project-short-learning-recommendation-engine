  "introduction": "The video introduces Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a new approach to training language models. DPO is a more efficient type of reinforcement learning that allows the model to move its probabilities away from bad answers and towards good answers. The video explains how DPO works, contrasts it with standard finetuning, and provides examples of two DPO data sets. It then walks through the training notebook for DPO, demonstrating how to bias the model towards better answers.",
