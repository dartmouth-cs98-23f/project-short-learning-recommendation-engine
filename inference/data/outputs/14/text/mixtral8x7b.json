  "introduction": "The video discusses the differences between the vanilla transformer and the architecture of mistral. It covers the sliding window attention, the kv cache, the sparse mixture of experts model, sharding, and pipeline parallelism. The video assumes the viewer is familiar with the transformer model and attention mechanism.",
