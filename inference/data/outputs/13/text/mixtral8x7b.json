  "introduction": "This video explores the architectural differences between the vanilla transformer and the new language model, Mistral, from Mistral AI. The video covers topics such as sliding window attention, kv cache, sparse mixture of experts model, sharding, and pipeline parallelism. It also delves into the code of Mistral and how it uses the Xformers library with block attention. The video assumes a basic understanding of the transformer model and attention mechanism, particularly self-attention.",
