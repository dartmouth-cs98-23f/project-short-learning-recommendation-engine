  "introduction": "This video introduces a new approach to training language models called Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). DPO is a type of reinforcement learning that moves the probabilities of a language model away from bad answers and towards good answers. The video explains how standard language model training works and how DPO works in contrast. It also provides an overview of the training data sets needed for DPO and walks through the training notebook step by step.",
