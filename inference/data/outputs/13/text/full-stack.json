  "introduction": "In this video, we will discuss the process of building a job board app that could be a real startup. We will start with a single data feed, a job board API, and a minimal simple frontend using React and Material UI. We will use an Express server for data storage and a Node cron job to fetch jobs and refresh them at a set interval.",
