  "introduction": "This video provides an overview of the Zig programming language, a high-performance system programming language created by Andrew Kelly in 2016. It is designed to be minimal, extremely fast, and allow for low-level memory control while providing a consistent interface for memory management through allocators. Zig does not have any hidden memory allocations, making the code far more explicit and portable. It also has no hidden control flow, no operator overloading, and no exceptions. Zig has a unique comp time keyword that makes it trivial to run kodak compile time instead of runtime. It can integrate well into a C or C++ code base and supports cross compilation out of the box with LLVM. This video covers Zig's memory management, explicit error handling, built-in testing framework, and more.",
