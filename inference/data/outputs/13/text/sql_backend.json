  "introduction": "This video discusses the reasons why selecting all columns (star) from a table in a relational database can be slow. It explores the concept of pages in a database and how reading data from a page involves multiple operations, including file system and ssd mapping. The video also explains how the database caches data in shared buffers for faster access.",
