  "introduction": "This video provides an introduction to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a type of reinforcement learning used to train language models. DPO allows for moving the probabilities of a language model away from bad answers and towards good answers, direct preference optimization, and achieving a level of safety and avoiding harmful results. The video covers two DPO data sets, the helpful and harmless reinforcement learning rate, and provides a step-by-step guide to training a language model using DPO.",
