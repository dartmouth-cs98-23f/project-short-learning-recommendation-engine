  "introduction": "This video explores the architectural differences between the vanilla transformer and the architecture of mistral, a new language model from mistal ai. The discussion covers the sliding window attention, kv cache, model sharding, and an overview of the code. The video also briefly reviews the sparse mixture of experts model and pipeline parallelism.",
