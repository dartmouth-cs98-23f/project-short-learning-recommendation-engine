"introduction": "This video introduces direct preference optimization (DPO) as a technique for training language models. DPO aims to bias the model's probabilities towards good answers and away from bad answers, making it more aligned with commercial models. The video provides an overview of DPO, explains how it differs from standard training, and demonstrates the process of training a model using DPO.",
