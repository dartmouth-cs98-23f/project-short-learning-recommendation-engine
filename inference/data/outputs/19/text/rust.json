  "introduction": "Rust is a memory-safe compiled programming language that provides high-level simplicity with low-level performance. It was developed as a side project by Mozilla in 2009 and has been ranked as the most loved programming language every year since 2016. Rust takes a unique approach to memory management by using ownership and borrowing to ensure safety while allowing full control over performance.",
