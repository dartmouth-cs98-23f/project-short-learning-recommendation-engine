"introduction": "In this video, we will build a job board app that can be used as a real startup. We will start by creating a minimum viable product (MVP) that consists of a single data feed from a job board API. We will use React and Redux for the front-end, Node.js and Express for the back-end, and Redis for data storage. We will also implement a cron job to fetch and refresh job data at a specified interval.",
