Prompt: General Topics:
[
  "Algorithms and Data Structures",
  "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning",
  "Computer Architecture",
  "Data Science and Analytics",
  "Database Systems and Management",
  "Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)",
  "Programming Languages and Software Development",
  "Software Engineering and System Design",
  "Web Development and Internet Technologies",
  "Computer Graphics and Visualization",
  "Theoretical Computer Science",
  "Quantum Computing"
]

Complexity scale:
[
  0.00-0.09: Elementary,
  0.10-0.19: Middle School,
  0.20-0.29: High School,
  0.30-0.39: Advanced High School,
  0.40-0.49: Introductory College,
  0.50-0.59: Average College Lecture,
  0.60-0.69: Advanced College,
  0.70-0.79: Graduate Level,
  0.80-0.89: Advanced Graduate Level,
  0.90-1.00: PhD Level Lecture
]

Generate a JSON summary the computer science or software engineering video. The summary should include:

1. A high-level synopsis labeled as "introduction".
2. A breakdown into 5 sections, each with:
   - A title starting with "Section x" where x is the section number from 1 to 5.
   - A "content" field containing 4 bullet points summarizing the section.
   - A "topics" field listing the 3 most important topics covered in the section.
3. A global "topics" array listing 5 key descriptors (1-2 words each) of topics covered in the video.
4. A global "general topics" array selecting 3 topics from the predefined list, each associated with an exact "complexity" score based on the provided scale. The complexity score should reflect the detailed complexity level with full two-decimal-place precision.

The JSON structure should strictly follow this template:
{
  "introduction": "High level synopsis here",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Section 1",
      "content": [
        "Bullet point 1",
        "Bullet point 2",
        "Bullet point 3",
        "Bullet point 4"
      ],
      "topics": ["Topic1", "Topic2", "Topic3"]
    },
    ... (total 5 sections)
  ],
  "topics": ["Descriptor1", "Descriptor2", "Descriptor3", "Descriptor4", "Descriptor5"],
  "general topics": [
    {
      "name": "Selected general topic 1",
      "complexity": "Exact complexity float with two decimals"
    },
    ... (total 3 general topics)
  ]
}

Please adhere strictly to the JSON format. Use domain-specific terminology in the "title" and "content" for each section. The "topics" and "general topics" should accurately reflect the video's content based on the predefined lists and complexity scale. The output should conclude with a '}' character to end the json above.
