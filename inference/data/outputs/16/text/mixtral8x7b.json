  "introduction": "In this video, we will explore the differences between the vanilla transformer and the architecture of mistral, a new language model from mistral AI. We will discuss the sliding window attention, the kv cache, the sparse mixture of experts model, and the code innovations in mistral. The video assumes a basic understanding of the transformer model and the attention mechanism.",
