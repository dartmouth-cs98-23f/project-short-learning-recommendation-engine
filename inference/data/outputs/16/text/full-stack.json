  "introduction": "The video tutorial demonstrates the process of building a job board app from scratch, intended to serve as a real startup platform for entry-level or junior developer positions. The app will start with a single data feed from a job board API, pulling jobs and filtering them down, and displaying them in a simple, super minimal front end using React and Material UI.",
