  "introduction": "In this video, the author explores the reasons behind the slow performance of the 'SELECT *' query in a relational database. They discuss the page-based structure of databases, how reading from disk involves multiple operations, and how the database converts raw bytes into shared buffers for efficient querying. The author also touches upon the limitations of block storage and the role of the file system in the process.",
