  "introduction": "In this episode of the Back Engineering Show, we delve into the topic of threading and multithreaded application development, specifically in the context of networking and connection management. We explore the challenges of managing connections and processing requests, and the importance of understanding the nature of your backend and the resources it consumes. We also discuss the evolution of CPU technology and how it has influenced the development of multithreading and concurrency in applications.",
