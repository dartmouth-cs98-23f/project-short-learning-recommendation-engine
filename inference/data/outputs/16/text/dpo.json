  "introduction": "This video discusses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a new approach to training language models that moves the probabilities of a model away from bad answers towards good answers. It is a more efficient technique than traditional methods used by companies like Open AI and Meta. The video provides an overview of standard training, contrasts it with DPO, and introduces two DPO data sets. It also walks through the training notebook for DPO step by step. The video aims to help viewers take a model they've developed into a chat format and align it in a similar way to commercial models. The video covers high-level concepts and provides examples to illustrate the concepts.",
