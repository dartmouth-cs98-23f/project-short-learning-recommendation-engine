  "introduction": "In this episode of the Vacancy Show, the concept of distributed systems and distributed hashing is discussed. The power of hash tables is explained, and the problem of resizing hash tables when the size of the array changes is addressed. The episode then moves on to discussing the challenges faced in distributed systems, particularly when it comes to determining which server to connect to to fetch a key. The concept of distributed hashing is introduced as a solution to this problem, and the advantages and disadvantages of different hashing functions are discussed.",
