    "introduction": "In this video, we will be discussing the concept of consistency hashing and its application in distributed systems. Consistency hashing is a technique used for consistent hashing and it's a technique that helps to map a hash function to a specific server in a distributed system. We will discuss the basics of consistency hashing and its applications in distributed systems.",
