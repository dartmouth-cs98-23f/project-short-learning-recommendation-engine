  "introduction": "In this video, we will be building a job board app that allows users to find entry-level or junior developer jobs on the internet. We will start with a single data feed that is a single job board api feeding into our app and a super minimal simple front end written in react and material ui on the front end. We will use an express server redis for our data storage because we are not writing or persisting any data that is not part of the job feed. We will use a node cron job to fetch these jobs and refresh them at a certain interval which are going to be filtered through an algorithm. We will have a key in redis and our value is going to be the whole job object so it would be a string version of this that we can then pull out we know it already json so we can just stringify it and then when we pull it out well just parse it into a javascript object now the slightly tric ather see that the length matches our our length that we put in lets parse it and then lets do dot lake okay so its kind of a lot that we did without testing it lets restart my server do the same curl oh mann
