"introduction": "In this tutorial, we will be discussing the new approach to training language models called Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and how it can be used to align the model probabilities away from bad answers and towards good answers. We will first take a look at standard finetuning and then contrast how DPO works and why it is a more efficient type of reinforcement learning. We will then move on to the two DPO data sets that are helpful in terms of a technique and its useful in a different and complementary way to standard finetuning then we will walk step by step through the training notebook I developed for doing DPO by the end of this tutorial you should be able to take a model youve developed a language model ideally you do some supervised finetuning to get it into a chat format and this will allow you to do the final stage of aligning the model um um
