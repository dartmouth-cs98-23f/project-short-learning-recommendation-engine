  "introduction": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a type of reinforcement learning used to train language models. It is more efficient than traditional methods used by companies like OpenAI and Meta in developing Lama 2. In this tutorial, we will explore the training notebook for DPO and learn how to train a model with a small billion parameter model. We will also see how to evaluate the model and the effect of DPO on the model's alignment with the prompt and the effect of DPO on the model's performance. We will also discuss some of the data sets used for training and the effect of DPO on the model's alignment with the prompt and the effect of DPO on the model's performance. We will also discuss some of the data sets used for training and the effect of DPO on the model's alignment with the prompt and the effect of DPO on the model's performance.",
