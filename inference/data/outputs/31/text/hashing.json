    "introduction": "In this computer science and software engineering video, we will be discussing hash tables, distributed systems, and consistency hashing. We will explore the power behind hash tables, their use case, and their applications. We will also look at how to distribute the billions of rows of data into multiple servers to improve performance. We will also touch on how to know which server the key lives in a distant server environment. We will also discuss the beauty of consistency hashing and the limitations of distributed systems. Finally, we will look at how to add or remove a server and the cost of adding or removing a server. We will also touch on replication, backup scenario, and mapping server that actually copies that data immediately right. We will also look at the replication scenario where we have this server you can either put it in both right that was an episode of the consistent hashing.
