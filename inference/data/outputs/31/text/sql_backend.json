In this video, we will be discussing the performance of SQL queries, specifically the "select star" query. The "select star" query is a universal SQL syntax that returns all columns in the table that you're selecting its been said that "select star" is slow and to avoid it like don't return on column because it is slow but I want to actually dive deep into the reasons of why "select star" is slow some of these reasons you might already know hey were turning 50 columns is of course lower than returning one but I think some of these reasons you might not have think about because it really involves understanding the entire stack and the backend engineering fundamentals and specifically the network aspects of things as well you know and obviously programming logic memory management how the os works all of this really affects the performance of your queries and selecting all the fields while convenient because you dont have to enumerate the fields you want is really it can impact the performance in general so I wrote up an article on medium that im gonna review in this video im going to add my comments on this article im going to explain how "select star" works and what are the reasons why it is slow and how to improve it
