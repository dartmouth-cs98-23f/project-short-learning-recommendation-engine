"introduction": "We are going to talk about building a job board app that can be a real startup that people use. We will start with a simple minimum viable product that is a single data feed that is a single job board api feeding into our app. We will use react and material ui on the front end, an express server redis for our data storage and node cron job to fetch these jobs and refresh them at a certain interval which are going to be filtered through an algorithm. We will start with a list of jobs that are pulled data from our api and that will be express and then finally we will have a super minimal simple front end were gonna do this in react and material ui on the front end. We will use an express server redis for our data storage because we are not writing or persisting any data that is not part of the job feed and then finally a node cron job to fetch these jobs and refresh them at a certain interval which are going to be filtered through an algorithm so lets draw this all out to get a better idea of our plan here is the plan for building this job board app for entry level and junior developer jobs on the internet for example github jobs stack overflow jobs you have angel list you have indeed but filtering through that especially because you kind of have to spam application for your first job can take long time so the good thing about all these job boards is they have public apis for the most part you always want to start with an mvp that is the minimum viable product today that means were going to start with a single data feed that is a single job board api feeding into our app. We are going to use an express server redis for our data storage because we are not writing or persisting any data that is not part of the job feed and then finally a node cron job to fetch these jobs and refresh them at a certain interval which are going to be filtered through an algorithm so lets draw this all out to get a better idea of our plan here is the plan for building this job board app for entry level and junior developer jobs on the internet for example github jobs stack overflow jobs you have angelic
