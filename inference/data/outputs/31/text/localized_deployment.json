  "introduction": "In this video, we will discuss containerization, a technology that allows developers to create and deploy applications in lightning-fast isolated environments. Containers are essentially full operating systems that can run on top of virtual machines. They are lightning-fast, isolated environments that can be created in mere moments. Containers are a powerful concept that allows developers to create and run applications without having to compromise anything on their local machine. We will explore how to create our own container and the basics of containerization.",
