We will explore the similarities and differences between these two frameworks in terms of rendering, component state, children, side effect, and templating. We will also discuss the differences in code when a component is initialized in React and Svelte. We will also look at the differences in templating starting with conditional logic and React uses JSX where you put your HTML in your JavaScript whereas Svelte has its own templating approach where you bring JavaScript into your HTML. We will also talk about conditional logic and React. We will also compare the big complicated topic of shared state like how Dao a similar mechanism built in called stores which are very similar to observables in libraries like rxj s we can then subscribe to the value of that store inside of any component both in the templates and in the javascript all we have to do is put a dollar sign in front of it thanks to the magic of the compiler as a spell user myself i cant even begin to tell you how much complexity and code this one little mechanism will eliminate from your code base it allows you to use reactive data throughout the entire application with surgical precision and zero bo
