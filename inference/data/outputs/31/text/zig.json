  "introduction": "In this video, we will explore the Zig programming language, a high-performance system programming language created by Andrew Kelly in 2016. We will delve into its features, such as its minimal design, fast performance, and low-level memory control, as well as its unique comp time keyword and built-in testing framework. We will also discuss its memory management and error handling capabilities, and how to use Zig in a C or C++ codebase.",

        "Zig is minimal, extremely fast, and allows for low-level memory control.",

        "Zig has no hidden control flow if it looks like a function and quacks like a function its a function theres no operator overloading and it doesnt even have exceptions if a function can fail it needs to return an explicit error value."
