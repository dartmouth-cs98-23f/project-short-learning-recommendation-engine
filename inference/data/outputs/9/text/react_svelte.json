    "React and Svelte both help developers build reactive UIs with JavaScript by organizing code into reusable components.",
    "React uses a virtual DOM and a runtime, while Svelte uses a compiler to eliminate the need for a runtime.",
    "React's virtual DOM requires some initial JavaScript and has a larger baseline size (around 70 KB) for rendering a 'hello world' example.",
    "Svelte's compiler results in a smaller 'hello world' example, but it may be considered 'cheating' by some JavaScript fundamentalists."

{
  "Section 2: Component State",
  "content": [
    "React uses functions to create components and add reactive state with the useState hook, which returns a reactive value and a setter function.",
    "Svelte defines logic within the script tags to create reactive state and allows for more concise code.",
    "Svelte does not require imports or function calls to initialize the state, while React does.",
    "React has a massive ecosystem of dedicated libraries to help with component state, while Svelte has an entirely different system called reactive declarations."

{
  "Section 3: Props and Children",
  "content": [
    "React passes props by defining them as function arguments that are typically destructured, while Svelte uses slots for inserting UI at specific points in components.",
    "React allows for passing components as props and rendering them directly in the JSX, while Svelte has an entirely different system called slots.",
    "Svelte's slots allow for more precise insertion of UI at specific points in components, while React's built-in propschildren value allows for more flexibility in rendering components.",
    "Svelte's slots system can be more readable and easier to debug than React's props system."

{
  "Section 4: Side Effects and Computed State",
  "content": [
    "React uses the useEffect hook to create side effects that update the document title whenever a count changes, while Svelte uses reactive declarations to rerun code whenever any dependent data changes.",
    "React's useEffect hook requires more complex code to handle an async function, while Svelte's reactive declarations are more reliable and easier to debug.",
    "Svelte's reactive declarations can be used for both side effects and computed state, while React requires a separate memo function to cache the value between renders.",
    "Svelte's reactive declarations are more concise and easier to read than React's useEffect hook."

  "Section 5: Templating",
  "content": [
    "React uses JSX for templating, which combines HTML and JavaScript, while Svelte has its own templating approach.",
    "React's JSX allows for more flexibility in rendering components, while Svelte's templating approach is more concise and easier to read.",
    "Svelte's templating approach allows for more precise conditional logic and better performance than React's JSX.",
    "React's JSX is more popular and widely used, while Svelte's templating approach is more niche and less well-known."
