  "introduction": "Rust is a memory-safe compiled programming language that delivers high-level simplicity with low-level performance. It is popular for building systems where performance is critical, such as game engines, databases, and operating systems. Rust has no garbage collector and achieves memory safety through ownership and borrowing concepts. It also has a package manager called Cargo for easy installation and execution. Rust is known for its absolute control over performance and is widely loved by its users.",
