  "introduction": "The video introduces Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as a new approach to training language models. It explains how standard finetuning works by penalizing the model based on predicted next tokens, and contrasts this with DPO, which uses pairs of answers to bias the model towards good answers. The video also highlights the usefulness of DPO in finding models aligned in a similar way to commercial models.",
