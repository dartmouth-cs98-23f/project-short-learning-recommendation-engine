    "Summary": "Rust is a memory safe compiled programming language that combines high-level simplicity with low-level performance. It is suitable for building high-performance systems such as game engines, databases, and operating systems, and is particularly well-suited for targeting WebAssembly. Rust takes a unique approach, with no garbage collector but achieves memory safety through concepts like ownership and borrowing. It has a package manager called cargo and is known for its safe and efficient memory management. Rust allows values to be used in the stack memory, which has minimal performance overhead. Mutable values are stored in the heap memory, and a borrowing system ensures that values can be accessed without unnecessary memory allocations. Rust has a rich standard library that includes modules to handle I/O, file systems, concurrency, and more. Finally, Rust enables developers to build memory-safe executables that deliver high performance and minimal overhead.",
