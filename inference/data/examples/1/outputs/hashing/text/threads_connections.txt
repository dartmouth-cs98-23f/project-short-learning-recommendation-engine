    "introduction": "The episode of the Back End Engineering Show discusses the challenges involved in threading and managing connections in backend applications, specifically in the context of TCP connection management. The concept of shared resources (CPUs, processes, etc.) and the role of operating systems in scheduling and managing these resources is explored. The video also touches on the evolution of CPUs and how an increasing number of cores have reduced contention and allowed for more efficient use of resources.",
