    "highLevelSummary": "The article explores the reasons why the 'select \*' SQL syntax can be slower in a relational database system. Discussed reasons include the impact of return times, network aspects, programming logic, memory management, and data size. Each section is further divided into sub-sections. Section 1 provides an overview of the subject, Section 2 discusses the basics of database pages and their fixed size, and Section 3 elaborates on the performance factors of reading rows from a page in a relational database.",
