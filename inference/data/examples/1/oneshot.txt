    "introduction": "The video discusses the concept and application of consistent hashing, a method used in distributing systems. The speaker begins by providing a brief explanation of hash tables and their use in software engineering. Then, he delves into issues that arise when the size of arrays changes in hash tables. This leads to the main point of the discussion - challenges in distributed systems when databases become too large for a single instance and need to be broken down or 'sharded' among multiple servers.",
