hello guys welcome back to my channel today we are going to talk about mistral so as you know mistral is a new language model that came out a few months ago from mistal ai which is a one of the hottest startup right now in europe for language models it also became a unicorn recently and we will exploring both the models they released one is the 7 billion and one is the 8 by7 billion model so lets review the topics of today the first thing i will introduce you is the architectural differences between the vanilla transformer and the architecture of mistal later we will see what is the sliding window attention and how it is related to the concept of receptive field a concept that usually we find in convolutional neural networks i will briefly review the kv cache because i want to introduce the concept of rolling buffer cache and also how it is done with prefilling and chunking uh we will see what is sparse mixture of experts model sharding with a little with a very brief introduction with d values if this concept is not clear i describe it very thoroughly in my previous video on lama the window size is the size of the sliding window that we used in the um calculation of the attention and we will see later how it works the context length is uh what is the context size of upon which it the model was trained upon uh and its much bigger for the 8x 7b the vocabulary size is the same for both and then the last two parameters you can see here are related to the sparse mixture of experts s a matrix that has the same shape as the input sequence but where each token now captures some more information about other tokens which tokens depending on the mask we have applied so our mask says that the first token can only watch itself so the first output token will be an embedding that will only depend on itself the second token will only depend on the first two tokens the third output token will only depend on the first three tokens the fourth will depend on the token number two because e take the last token of the output and we prep append it to the input for the temp step three and this will become the new input which will produce love that can then we take the last token of the output and we append it to the input for the time step four so it will become the new output will become love that can quickly then we take this word quickly we append it to the input for the next time step and it will produce the next token as output etc etc until the last token until we see the end   the kv cache that so that we can then exploit this kv cache to build new tokens future tokens now the prompt is known in advance right because because its the input of our user its what you ask to ch gpd for example right tell me a poem tell me write me a poem or tell me a joke this is our prompt so its known in advance so we dont we dont need to generate it okay so what we can do is we can prefill the kv cache using the tokens of the prompt but there are many ways to do it like we were doing b they want to work with and choosing the logits of the best two performing uh experts okay the next thing we are talking going to talk about is model sharding which is also implemented in the code of the mistal model so lets talk about it when we have a model that is too big to fit in a single gpu we can divide the model into groups of layers and place each group of layers in a single gpu for example in the case of mistal we have 32 layers of encoders you can see here one after another i didnt do o check the embedding corresponding to the token number three for the first prompt to the token number seven for the second prompt and the last token for the third prompt so we take all these embeddings we run them through the linear layer then we apply the soft marks and then we understand what is the next uh token from our vocabulary but you may be wondering how do we even produce an attention mask that can work with multiple prompts that are combined into one sequence such that the token of o ent with the official code of mistal so that you can understand uh more about the inner workings of this grd model i actually really enjoyed studying it i really enjoyed studying the code and i learned a lot of stuff you know um i think its very very good when you are doing something that is very complicated because it teaches you a lot because if something is simple then you dont learn much by the end of the day anyway guys thanks you for watching my video i hope you also enjoyed this journey with me even if it was very complicated i hope that you likeed this video and you will subscribe to my channel if you didnt please do it and the best way to support me guys is to share this video with all the people you know so share it on social media share it on linkedin on twitter etc because this is the best way to you can help me is to grow my channel and um please let me know if there is something that you dont understand i am always available to help and connect with me on linkedin byebye

Transcript:
whats up guys back today with another longer video which is to build a job board app that could actually be a real startup that people use theres a lot of different places to find entry level or junior developer jobs on the internet for example github jobs stack overflow jobs you have angel list you have indeed but filtering through those especially because you kind of have to spam applications for your first job can take a long time so the good thing about all these job boards is they have public apis for the most part you always want to start with an mvp that is the minimum viable product today that means were going to start with a single data feed that is a single job board api feeding into our app and then finally were gonna have a super minimal simple front end were gonna do this in react and material ui on the front end were gonna use an express server redis for our data storage because were not writing or persisting any data that is not part of the job feed and then finally a no p to date theres no expired jobs that the companies dont want people to see anymore and were basically staying in sync with whatever is in uh our upstream data source so within worker i want to create an indexjs which is going to manage all our worker tasks and i know already that were going to need the cron node library its just going to help us run simple cron jobs which is what i was saying before is the its the way you run a task on an interval basically forever if you want to opening up a n istent and that means if your system shuts off you lose all your ram so its not a fault tolerant database its not a durable database and the upside is though that its really fast its kind of like an object in javascript you just if you have the key its constant time access you just pull it out of your redis store and then you can serve it up in our case jumping back over to these um these job uh json that we got from github you can see every job has a uuid which is a guaranteed unique id because en we send it to our client but um in the meantime just to see the length and or rather see that the length matches our our length that we put in lets parse it and then lets do dot lake okay so its kind of a lot that we did without testing it lets restart our server do the same curl oh man okay 245 i dont remember if thats how many we put in were definitely getting a list of 245 which is a good sign now lets just try sending this back and see if we get that full uh stringified object thats exact m lets see if by pasting it directly in we we need to do anything else just going to make sure thats formatted correctly saved it and um lets just take this out classes direction rtl okay lets see how theme is being used because this is kind of a um darn all right i dont know why that would change from left to right but um it might be a mobile implementation specific thing so lets just take this and hard code it as right and well hard code this one as left and see if we run in any problems okay  y domain i already bought it a normalcom domain is going to be about 14 a year and the first thing we need to do is use the digital ocean name servers so that domain can be directed over to our server so youll see that i have clicked on my domain ive opened the dns tab and then theres a name servers tab and ive clicked use custom name servers now im going to put that on pause and jump over to the digital ocean dashboard you can make a digitalocean account for free and itll give you this dashboar doesnt affect anything on production so um proxying all api routes to a target of localhost sorry need the double quotes there http localhost uh 3001 was our api server i believe and ill save that and again that just helps us you know still develop in the same way but we need to make one config change for the production server as well so that was our change in um in our files and as i mentioned im going to go actually back into that nginx config file etc engine x sites available default and i ha  production launch so to speak this was just our base framework that were building more features off of but at minimum i think we need a few more data feeds and we need to make our algorithm a lot more robust prevent it from breaking on errors as well as filtering down those jobs a lot more because if we get in five feeds were just gonna have a huge amount of jobs and we really wanna make sure those are entry level jobs so im thinking that we parse through the description and look for like three to five years of experience and take those out i think anything less than three years would qualify as an entrylevel job so again were gonna have to keep working on the algorithm and then otherwise were gonna want to add a little bit of monitoring logging different things like that but that can all come later our mvp is done and our base of our application is done so thats pretty cool so anyway hope you learned something um let me know if you have any questions and i will talk to you guys soon

what do dynamodb apache cassandra discord and  akamai cdn have in common they all use consistent   hashing now what is consistent hashing why do all  the cool kids use it in this video well learn   208696all about it lets dive right in in a large scale  distributed system data does not fit on a single   server they are distributed across many machines  this is called horizontal scaling to build such   34852a system with predictable performance it is  important to distribute the data evenly across   400672those servers a common method to distribute  data as evenly as possible among servers is   simple hashing this is how it works first for each  object we hash its key with a hashing function   like md5 or murmurhash this maps the object  key to a known range of numerical values   620496a good hashing function distributes the  hashes evenly across the entire range   second we perform the modulo operation on the  hash against the number of servers this determines   which servers the object belongs to as long  as the number of servers stays the same   an object key will always map to the same server  heres a concrete example we have four servers   871256with eight string keys with simple hashing  this is how we distribute the eight string   927268keys among the four servers now this  ow applying the modulo operation to a  different set of n in this case it is now three   the impact is pretty drastic most of the keys get  redistributed this affects almost all objects its   not just the objects originally stored in the  server that is now offline this triggers a storm   1399260of misses and lots of objects to be moved for  situations where servers constantly come and go   this design is untenable consistent hashing is  an effective technique to mitigate this issue   the goal of consistent hashing is this we want  almost all objects to stay assigned to the same   158868server even as the number of servers changes  here is th tion to hashing the object keys like before  we also hash the server names the objects and   1727268servers are hashed with the same hashing function  to the same range of values in our example we have   a range of x0 to xn this range is called a hash  space next we connect both ends of the hash space   to form a ring this is a hash ring using a hashing  function we hash each server by its name or ip   1964896address and place the server onto the ring here we  place our four servers onto the ring next we hash   each object by its key with the same hashing  function unlike simple hashing where we perform   a modulo operation on the hash here w  onto the ring   2188568here is what it would look like for our four  objects to locate the server for a particular   object we go clockwise from the location of the  object key on the ring until a server is found   2316784continue with our example key 0 is on server 0  and key 1 is on server 1 now lets take a look at   what happens when we add a server here we insert  a new server s4 to the left of s0 on the ring   note that only k0 needs to be moved from s0 to  s4 this is because s4 is the first server k0   encounters by going clockwise from k0s position  on the ring keys k1 k2 and k3 are not affected   with simple hashing when a new server pped with   consistent hashing adding a new server only  requires redistribution of a fraction of the keys   lets walk through a quick example of removing  a server when s1 is removed only k1 needs to be   remapped to s2 the rest of the keys are unaffected  lets recap what have we learned so far one   2941660we map both servers and objects onto the hash  ring using a uniformly distributed hash function   two to locate a server for an object we go  clockwise on the ring from the objects position   until a server is found now lets consider  a potential issue with this design   the distribution of the objects in the  servers on the ring is likel  points on the ring  we are very unlikely to get a perfect partition of   3259268the ring into equally sized segments for example  if servers are mapped on the ring like this   3333684most of the objects are stored in s2 with s1  and s3 storing no data this problem gets worse   if servers come and go frequently in our example  even if the servers were originally evenly spaced   3488648if s1 is removed the segment for s2 is now  twice as large as the ones for s0 and s3   356864virtual nodes are used to fix this problem the  idea is to have each server appear at multiple   3632744locations on the ring each location is a virtual  node representi rvers with each having three virtual  nodes instead of having s0 and s1 we now have   3791296s00 s01 and s02 to represent server 0 and s10  s11 and s12 to represent server 1 on the ring   with virtual nodes each server handles multiple  segments on the ring in our example the segments   3968624labeled s0 are managed by server 0 and  those labeled s 1 are handled by server 1   4040448in real world systems the number of  virtual nodes is much larger than   three as the number of virtual nodes increases  the distribution of objects becomes more balanced   4156856having more virtual nodes means taking more space  to store the metadata about the virtual nodes   this is a tradeoff and we can tune the number  of virtual nodes to fit our system requirements  4276576lets see how consistent hashing is used in  the real world some popular nosql databases   4333668like amazon dynamodb and apache cassandra use  consistent hashing where it is used for data   partitioning it helps these databases minimize  data movement during rebalancing content delivery   networks like akamai use consistent hashing to  help distribute web contents evenly among the   edge servers load balancers like google load  balancer use consistent hashing to distribute   4608568persistent connections evenly across backend  servers this limits the number of connections   4664864that need to be reestablished when a backend  server goes down thats it for consistent hashing   if you would like to learn more about system  design check out our books and weekly newsletters   4780536please subscribe if you learned something new  thank you so much and well see you next time

   - A "content" field containing 4 bullet points summarizing the section.
   - A "topics" field listing the 3 most important topics covered in the section.
3. A global "topics" array listing 5 key descriptors (1-2 words each) of topics covered in the video.
4. A global "generalTopics" array selecting 3 topics from the "General Topics", each associated with an exact "complexity" score based on the "Complexity Scale". The complexity score should reflect the detailed complexity level with full two-decimal-place precision.

The JSON structure should strictly follow this template:
{
  "introduction": "High level synopsis here",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Section 1",
      "content": [
        "Bullet point 1",
        "Bullet point 2",
        "Bullet point 3",
        "Bullet point 4"
      ],
      "topics": ["Topic1", "Topic2", "Topic3"]
    },
    ... (total 5 sections)
  ],
  "topics": ["Descriptor1", "Descriptor2", "Descriptor3", "Descriptor4", "Descriptor5"],
  "generalTopics": [
    {
      "name": "Selected general topic 1",
      "complexity": "Exact complexity float with two decimals"
    },
    ... (total 3 general topics)
  ]
}

The output must follow the specified JSON structure, focusing on domain-specific terminology in the "content" sections. Use the previous "Complexity Scale" list when generating "complexity". Use the previous "General Topics" list when generating the "generalTopics" field. If the video content does not directly match a topic from this list, select the closest related topic available.
