0.08,4.64,react.js a half-baked functional ui
2.72,3.76,library created at facebook that's used
4.72,3.68,by millions of developers because it has
6.48,4.239,a cool name and logo it was invented by
8.4,3.68,mark zuckerberg in 2013. and that was a
10.719,3.681,big mistake
12.08,4.4,and it was my mistake and i'm sorry
14.4,3.36,react is simple it's just javascript bro
16.48,3.04,and that's why it gives you dozens of
17.76,3.12,weird ways to solve the same problems
19.52,3.12,like functional and class-based
20.88,3.68,components hooks forward ref higher
22.64,4.08,order components mix-ins render props
24.56,4.08,suspense and so on it's credited as the
26.72,3.28,first declarative ui library even though
28.64,3.52,it took most of those ideas from
30.0,3.44,angularjs its killer feature though is
32.16,2.88,the fact that you can write pure
33.44,3.2,functional code that is until you want
35.04,2.96,to do anything useful in which case
36.64,3.12,you'll need to write imper functions
38.0,3.2,with state and effects the beauty of
39.76,3.2,this approach is that it makes simple
41.2,3.039,things like reactive state much more
42.96,2.48,complicated than they need to be and
44.239,3.361,that's what makes us feel like real
45.44,3.599,developers use effect is especially fun
47.6,3.279,and was originally going to be called
49.039,3.601,use foot gun because it's a great way to
50.879,3.36,introduce infinite loops performance
52.64,3.12,issues and bugs that you'll never be
54.239,2.881,able to figure out not to worry though
55.76,3.2,react is always evolving with
57.12,3.2,revolutionary new features to monkey
58.96,3.04,patch all the weirdness nobody saw
60.32,3.12,coming on the previous release now even
62.0,3.28,though it has an extremely high learning
63.44,3.12,curve react is a library and not a
65.28,2.96,framework and that means to build
66.56,3.36,something cool you'll need to find and
68.24,3.12,install hundreds of different packages
69.92,2.96,most of which were built by teenagers
71.36,2.96,who stopped maintaining them years ago
72.88,3.279,when they went off to college to learn a
74.32,3.52,real language like c to get started
76.159,3.761,create a new react app then open up
77.84,4.08,google to enter the gates of tutorial
79.92,3.519,hell notice how we start in strict mode
81.92,2.96,that's used to hide baggage from
83.439,3.121,previous versions of the framework i
84.88,3.2,mean library now in the code we pretend
86.56,3.199,we're doing functional programming by
88.08,3.84,writing our components as functions
89.759,4.0,classes are also possible but they are
91.92,3.36,literally the double instead we use
93.759,3.281,these hooks everywhere that do the same
95.28,3.839,classes do in a more magical
97.04,4.079,hipstery way templating is handled in
99.119,4.161,jsx it's a non-standard way to write
101.119,4.64,html which allows you to represent the
103.28,4.72,ui entirely in non-portable callback
105.759,3.68,hell now we can all agree to hate css
108.0,3.2,but react will make you hate it even
109.439,3.441,more when you try to style something on
111.2,3.76,your own luckily there are hundreds of
112.88,4.0,css and js libraries working on this
114.96,3.519,problem as we speak the extra complexity
116.88,3.599,is worth it though because react is
118.479,3.92,blazingly fast assuming you implemented
120.479,3.441,all the weird tricks flawlessly life is
122.399,3.68,about suffering it's not supposed to be
123.92,3.76,fun like spelt or fast like solid or
126.079,3.04,reliable like angular or all of the
127.68,3.44,above like view the only thing that
129.119,4.001,matters is react is the most popular and
131.12,3.759,that makes it undeniably the best just
133.12,3.52,like microsoft makes the best operating
134.879,3.201,system and mcdonald's makes the best
136.64,3.2,food this has been me destroying my
138.08,3.76,reputation with the react community in
139.84,3.6,100 seconds react has been the most
141.84,3.039,influential library in front of web
143.44,3.12,development for the last decade
144.879,3.36,nothing's perfect but it got to where it
146.56,3.2,is today because it does a lot of things
148.239,3.36,right and for that it deserves our
149.76,5.199,respect thanks for watching and i will
151.599,3.36,see you in the next one
