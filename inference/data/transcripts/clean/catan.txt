[Music] what's going on Danny crew it's Danny Drew here and we are back for another day of kadan in today's lesson video we are going to be talking about the placement traps that kill your game before it even starts I have seen too many new and beginning players play the game of Katon make subtle placement decisions that absolutely eviscerate your chances of winning what we're going to do is we're going to break down these traps we're to go through each one with a little bit of nuance and hopefully by the end of this video you will be placing better and winning more games if you're ready let's get into it get excited cuz I certainly am I want to make a quick statement here before we get into the examples which is that not every trap is necessarily a trap it's more important to realize that certain situations have certain nuances and it's important for you to read the board use the previous lesson videos we talked about placements and placing out and to be able to make a good read if this is going to be a trap or not as an example we'll walk through some of these key traps placing next to a starting Road this is a very common mistake where a lot of players don't see that a player on the way back and start with a road and then drop a road onto their Road and they lose the spot they're going to so the plow we I think we've all been there we've all seen it how about starting with inflexible to Resource setups a lot of players love to go for like a double or sheep there's some issues with that which is that it offers potentially some inflexibility again you have to back all these decisions up with good calculation placing with inflexible ports maybe you have a ton of wood and you don't have a way to use it effectively that's a problem how about building on only one potential Road subtle we'll show some examples of that and the last one which you know you have to make a judgment call but placing on setups that might get over blocked op setups you know that 659 or we cheap probably worth taking in most cases but you have to know the dynamic of the board and know if you're going to get outpaced by the rest of the board so let's get into an example here I'm super excited I hope you are too why don't we sit down for a second pause the board if you need to do some calculations and I would recommend you place this board out as much as you can see if you can pick first second third fourth all the way through to all eight placements and then when you're done with that unpause the video and we'll talk about how this game actually occurred hopefully you did that so here you go the first placement on this board was 6510 and the whole idea is they want to go 6510 to 810 why is this a placement trap well there's a few reasons if you look at the makeup of this board the first thing is that 6510 is nice on the surface but you're only going to one subtle spot which is the 810 that would be okay but the issue here in first is it's not guaranteed you're going to get the 810 if you look at the wheat on this board the eight is the best wheat so you know it has value with all this ore that's on this board but also the 810 is a fantastic spot potentially for like the five9 10 player so I think if black was just being a little bit more critical about their calculations they would see 6510 is probably losing the 810 in most cases and this makes it a very bad pick so first trap be careful make sure you back up your placement decision with good calculation second picks the 5910 now kind of playing off of what we saw in the previous Slide the 5910 obviously can take the 810 but you're going to see that there are some clear problems with this one of the issues I have with the 5910 Point left is that it's too inflexible pointing left to a brick Port makes no sense much better in this situation is the point up now it is true that the 5910 left gives you two settles but frankly you're probably not beating the 1083 at the bottom here to The Brick Port so effectively you have one settle on the five so much better is if you point up here then you get the road subtle onto the 52 but you also get the 31 which plays much better with the setup than simply playing off the brck port so be very careful about taking inflexible setups in second third takes the 643 here at the top you can see that makes a lot of sense now the question for you is what do you do in fourth I want you to pause the video and place it out take as much time as you need but make sure you do the exercise and come back I'd be very curious in the comments can you tell me what you picked here for fourth I'd be very very curious type it in now uh that way you don't see the answer give you a second 5 4 3 2 1 all right so this is what fourth decided to pick the 942 and the 8103 now clearly Red's intention here was that they wanted to go for ows they want to go 52 get the pork get the or but what's the issue with this well I think a lot of things are going to be clear when you understand the forcing sequence and I believe that this sequence is absolutely forced because if you do your calculations again everything needs to be placed out with calculations and consideration then this is what happen on the way back this player here takes the 853 because they do not want to ever give that spot to the 5109 but then you ask where does the 5109 go well we talked about this earlier they're going to go in the 810 all of this has been forced given Red's placements so then black has to take the space it makes sense they have the wood and the brick they take the 5411 now they should have pointed left because Road settling on the 9 through1 is much better than pointing right but I want you to see out of all that entire situation we could have calculated purple settle we could have calculated a white settle and we could have seen what's going to happen now the big issue for red is that he's playing ows when you have two other ows players and he's way too slow he needs to Road settle 52 he needs to be buying development cards while trying to build a city and trying to compete against two people who are literally all o WS it's not going to happen and the final result of this game is essentially that red took Road here so they're they're sitting here with eight points they're essentially six points with longest road and then they need to manufacture two more points while not losing road to Black ultimately what happened was that purple here just absolutely cooked dropped four cities VP just built a tent uh didn't even need armor which is crazy that blacket Army here but you can see the inflexibility of these setups really became problematic red I think went for the wrong plan on the wrong board and it cost him the game so knowing this what would you do here what you do here and forth I want you to revisit the fact and maybe if you pick that setup that's perfectly fine the 492 8103 but how can we essentially change our thought here we know ows is not the way buying development cards is going to be too heavily contested so your intuition say how do I play a game where maybe I go for longest road remember we always talk about you need to find a win condition to fight for whether it's root or Army but pick one and go for it I'm going to give you a few more seconds here okay okay so here is what I have come up with a better situation for fourth here which is that 6912 and the 1083 the reason this is better is a few things the brick Port which should be a little bit more evident for you you already know there's going to be two players playing ows very clear there the game you have here as red I think is very good you have the 611 which gives you that just little touch of sheet brick Port the 34 the 84 you have options you have expansions and you have all five resources after your key settles this setup is going to give red the best opportunity to play this game and also they effectively control the entire bottom half of this board if you cut a line through the middle of this board and then you look at where Red's at he literally has everything down here now I understand this is a desert but you only need so much production to stay viable in this particular situation I hope this was helpful for you I hope you can see very quickly going through some of these examples how these mistakes really can stack up and make a difference black putting themselves only Road settle situation which you can calculate they're going to lose that white playing a relatively inflexible ows game but also pointing left to an inflexible Port doesn't make sense I think really purple played a near perfect game had a great plan great production their setup made a lot of sense so kudos for them and that's why they won and then red I think took a relatively slow setup and an ineffective one at that versus if they played Road they probably have a much better chance fighting this game all right y'all that's all I got for today hopefully this was helpful I really appreciate the "support we are going to 10you like more of these kind of videos little quick lessons ways to improve your game in the way you think
