0.199,4.241,what's going on Danny crew it's Danny
2.399,5.161,Drew here and we are back for another
4.44,4.199,day of kadan in today's lesson video we
7.56,4.159,are going to be talking about the
8.639,5.521,placement traps that kill your game
11.719,4.961,before it even starts I have seen too
14.16,5.879,many new and beginning players play the
16.68,6.839,game of Katon make subtle placement
20.039,5.121,decisions that absolutely eviscerate
23.519,2.84,your chances of winning what we're going
25.16,3.32,to do is we're going to break down these
26.359,4.281,traps we're to go through each one with
28.48,3.88,a little bit of nuance and hopefully by
30.64,5.28,the end of this video you will be
32.36,5.6,placing better and winning more games if
35.92,4.799,you're ready let's get into it get
37.96,5.32,excited cuz I certainly am I want to
40.719,5.68,make a quick statement here before we
43.28,5.64,get into the examples which is that not
46.399,4.881,every trap is necessarily a trap it's
48.92,4.76,more important to realize that certain
51.28,5.4,situations have certain nuances and it's
53.68,4.719,important for you to read the board use
56.68,4.879,the previous lesson videos we talked
58.399,5.041,about placements and placing out and to
61.559,4.24,be able to make a good read if this is
63.44,3.48,going to be a trap or not as an example
65.799,4.161,we'll walk through some of these key
66.92,4.6,traps placing next to a starting Road
69.96,3.839,this is a very common mistake where a
71.52,4.48,lot of players don't see that a player
73.799,4.561,on the way back and start with a road
76.0,4.0,and then drop a road onto their Road and
78.36,3.439,they lose the spot they're going to so
80.0,3.4,the plow we I think we've all been there
81.799,6.201,we've all seen it how about starting
83.4,6.96,with inflexible to Resource setups a lot
88.0,4.72,of players love to go for like a double
90.36,4.28,or sheep there's some issues with that
92.72,4.24,which is that it offers potentially some
94.64,4.799,inflexibility again you have to back all
96.96,4.199,these decisions up with good calculation
99.439,3.081,placing with inflexible ports maybe you
101.159,3.32,have a ton of wood and you don't have a
102.52,4.559,way to use it effectively that's a
104.479,4.68,problem how about building on only one
107.079,4.841,potential Road subtle we'll show some
109.159,4.521,examples of that and the last one which
111.92,3.44,you know you have to make a judgment
113.68,4.079,call but placing on setups that might
115.36,5.24,get over blocked op setups you know that
117.759,5.081,659 or we cheap probably worth taking in
120.6,4.4,most cases but you have to know the
122.84,4.76,dynamic of the board and know if you're
125.0,5.28,going to get outpaced by the rest of the
127.6,4.76,board so let's get into an example here
130.28,4.48,I'm super excited I hope you are too why
132.36,3.56,don't we sit down for a second pause the
134.76,2.839,board if you need to do some
135.92,3.76,calculations and I would recommend you
137.599,3.801,place this board out as much as you can
139.68,3.839,see if you can pick first second third
141.4,3.8,fourth all the way through to all eight
143.519,3.481,placements and then when you're done
145.2,3.56,with that unpause the video and we'll
147.0,3.599,talk about how this game actually
148.76,4.72,occurred
150.599,5.601,hopefully you did that so here you go
153.48,4.759,the first placement on this board was
156.2,4.84,6510 and the whole idea is they want to
158.239,5.561,go 6510 to 810 why is this a placement
161.04,5.68,trap well there's a few reasons if you
163.8,5.439,look at the makeup of this board the
166.72,4.879,first thing is that 6510 is nice on the
169.239,5.161,surface but you're only going to one
171.599,5.961,subtle spot which is the 810 that would
174.4,4.479,be okay but the issue here in first is
177.56,3.759,it's not guaranteed you're going to get
178.879,4.881,the 810 if you look at the wheat on this
181.319,4.2,board the eight is the best wheat so you
183.76,4.479,know it has value with all this ore
185.519,4.72,that's on this board but also the 810 is
188.239,6.161,a fantastic spot potentially for like
190.239,5.28,the five9 10 player so I think if black
194.4,3.0,was just being a little bit more
195.519,4.761,critical about their calculations they
197.4,5.8,would see 6510 is probably losing the
200.28,6.4,810 in most cases and this makes it a
203.2,6.119,very bad pick so first trap be careful
206.68,5.44,make sure you back up your placement
209.319,6.521,decision with good
212.12,6.039,calculation second picks the 5910 now
215.84,5.36,kind of playing off of what we saw in
218.159,5.681,the previous Slide the 5910 obviously
221.2,4.8,can take the 810 but you're going to see
223.84,3.92,that there are some clear problems with
226.0,4.2,this one of the issues I have with the
227.76,4.8,5910 Point left is that it's too
230.2,4.64,inflexible pointing left to a brick Port
232.56,5.48,makes no sense much better in this
234.84,6.119,situation is the point up now it is true
238.04,4.68,that the 5910 left gives you two settles
240.959,3.84,but frankly you're probably not beating
242.72,4.2,the 1083 at the bottom here to The Brick
244.799,3.921,Port so effectively you have one settle
246.92,3.599,on the five so much better is if you
248.72,4.719,point up here then you get the road
250.519,4.8,subtle onto the 52 but you also get the
253.439,4.36,31 which plays much better with the
255.319,4.281,setup than simply playing off the brck
257.799,4.68,port so be very careful about taking
259.6,5.159,inflexible setups in second third takes
262.479,4.561,the 643 here at the top you can see that
264.759,4.401,makes a lot of sense now the question
267.04,3.68,for you is what do you do in fourth I
269.16,4.28,want you to pause the
270.72,4.759,video and place it out take as much time
273.44,3.72,as you need but make sure you do the
275.479,3.361,exercise and come back I'd be very
277.16,3.879,curious in the comments can you tell me
278.84,4.76,what you picked here for fourth I'd be
281.039,4.961,very very curious type it in now uh that
283.6,9.0,way you don't see the answer give you a
286.0,10.6,second 5 4 3 2
292.6,8.159,1 all right so this is what fourth
296.6,6.96,decided to pick the 942 and the
300.759,4.961,8103 now clearly Red's intention here
303.56,5.0,was that they wanted to go for ows they
305.72,5.759,want to go 52 get the pork get the or
308.56,5.919,but what's the issue with
311.479,4.28,this well I think a lot of things are
314.479,4.28,going to be clear when you understand
315.759,5.201,the forcing sequence and I believe that
318.759,4.361,this sequence is absolutely forced
320.96,4.84,because if you do your calculations
323.12,5.639,again everything needs to be placed out
325.8,4.56,with calculations and consideration then
328.759,3.801,this is what happen
330.36,5.08,on the way
332.56,4.479,back this player here takes the 853
335.44,3.319,because they do not want to ever give
337.039,3.761,that spot to the
338.759,3.641,5109 but then you ask where does the
340.8,4.2,5109 go well we talked about this
342.4,5.68,earlier they're going to go in the 810
345.0,5.84,all of this has been forced given Red's
348.08,4.48,placements so then black has to take the
350.84,3.88,space it makes sense they have the wood
352.56,4.16,and the brick they take the 5411 now
354.72,4.039,they should have pointed left because
356.72,4.08,Road settling on the 9 through1 is much
358.759,3.201,better than pointing right but I want
360.8,3.8,you to
361.96,5.32,see out of all that entire
364.6,4.96,situation we could have calculated
367.28,4.319,purple settle we could have calculated a
369.56,3.639,white settle and we could have seen
371.599,4.201,what's going to happen now the big issue
373.199,5.72,for red is that he's playing ows when
375.8,7.0,you have two other ows players and he's
378.919,6.161,way too slow he needs to Road settle 52
382.8,4.64,he needs to be buying development cards
385.08,4.36,while trying to build a city and trying
387.44,5.4,to compete against two people who are
389.44,6.84,literally all o WS it's not going to
392.84,7.4,happen and the final result of this
396.28,6.039,game is essentially that red took Road
400.24,3.48,here so they're they're sitting here
402.319,3.481,with eight points they're essentially
403.72,4.759,six points with longest road and then
405.8,5.2,they need to manufacture two more points
408.479,5.041,while not losing road to Black
411.0,4.879,ultimately what happened was that purple
413.52,5.32,here just absolutely cooked dropped four
415.879,4.521,cities VP just built a tent uh didn't
418.84,4.639,even need armor which is crazy that
420.4,5.479,blacket Army here but you can see the
423.479,4.84,inflexibility of these setups really
425.879,5.121,became problematic red I think went for
428.319,5.56,the wrong plan on the wrong board and it
431.0,4.72,cost him the game so knowing this what
433.879,5.32,would you do here what you do here and
435.72,5.039,forth I want you to revisit the fact and
439.199,4.641,maybe if you pick that setup that's
440.759,5.12,perfectly fine the 492 8103 but how can
443.84,4.12,we essentially change our thought here
445.879,3.6,we know ows is not the way buying
447.96,2.44,development cards is going to be too
449.479,4.12,heavily
450.4,5.68,contested so your intuition say how do I
453.599,5.081,play a game where maybe I go for longest
456.08,4.32,road remember we always talk about you
458.68,3.639,need to find a win condition to fight
460.4,3.84,for whether it's root or Army but pick
462.319,4.761,one and go for it I'm going to give you
464.24,2.84,a few more seconds
469.44,6.52,here okay okay so here is what I have
473.72,7.28,come up with a better situation for
475.96,7.679,fourth here which is that 6912 and the
481.0,4.639,1083 the reason this is better is a few
483.639,4.161,things the brick Port which should be a
485.639,3.28,little bit more evident for you you
487.8,4.239,already know there's going to be two
488.919,5.881,players playing ows very clear there the
492.039,4.961,game you have here as red I think is
494.8,3.88,very good you have the 611 which gives
497.0,5.24,you that just little touch of sheet
498.68,5.4,brick Port the 34 the 84 you have
502.24,3.519,options you have expansions and you have
504.08,4.36,all five resources after your key
505.759,5.16,settles this setup is going to give red
508.44,5.599,the best opportunity to play this game
510.919,5.04,and also they effectively control the
514.039,3.961,entire bottom half of this board if you
515.959,3.88,cut a line through the middle of this
518.0,5.08,board and then you look at where Red's
519.839,5.801,at he literally has everything down here
523.08,4.36,now I understand this is a desert but
525.64,3.879,you only need so much production to stay
527.44,3.68,viable in this particular situation I
529.519,3.121,hope this was helpful for you I hope you
531.12,4.719,can see very quickly going through some
532.64,4.92,of these examples how these mistakes
535.839,3.921,really can stack up and make a
537.56,4.68,difference black putting themselves
539.76,4.0,only Road settle situation which you can
542.24,3.56,calculate they're going to lose that
543.76,4.56,white playing a relatively inflexible
545.8,4.96,ows game but also pointing left to an
548.32,4.44,inflexible Port doesn't make sense I
550.76,3.84,think really purple played a near
552.76,3.84,perfect game had a great plan great
554.6,3.6,production their setup made a lot of
556.6,4.72,sense so kudos for them and that's why
558.2,5.92,they won and then red I think took a
561.32,5.079,relatively slow setup and an ineffective
564.12,4.24,one at that versus if they played Road
566.399,3.88,they probably have a much better chance
568.36,3.52,fighting this game all right y'all
570.279,3.481,that's all I got for today hopefully
571.88,5.0,this was helpful I really appreciate the
