  "introduction": "Music Zig is a high-performance system programming language created by Andrew Kelly in 2016. It is often compared to C and is designed to be minimal, fast, and allow for low-level memory control. The language has a unique comp time keyword that makes it easy to run code at compile time instead of runtime. It also integrates well with C and C++ code bases and supports cross-compilation out of the box with LLVM.",
