  "introduction": "In this video, we will delve into the reasons behind the slow performance of selecting all columns in a table. We will explore the database stack and how it affects the read operation, as well as the layers involved in the process. We will also discuss the impact of the file system, storage driver, and shared memory on the performance of the read operation. The video will provide insights into the complexity of the topic and its relevance to the field of computer science and software engineering.",
