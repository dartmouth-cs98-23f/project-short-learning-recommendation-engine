  "introduction": "The video introduces the concept of slow performance when selecting all columns (SELECT \* ) in a relational database. The author explains that the reason behind this is that reading all columns requires a full table scan, which can be inefficient. They then delve into the details of how databases read data, including the concept of pages, rows, and columns.",
