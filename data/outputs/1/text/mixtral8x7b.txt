"introduction": "The video provides an introduction to the new language model, Mistral, which was recently released by Mistral AI, a startup in Europe. The speaker explains the differences between Mistral and other transformer-based models, including the vanilla transformer and LLama. The speaker further outlines the topics to be covered in the video, including the sliding window attention, the kv cache, sparse mixture of experts, sharding, pipeline parallelism, and code analysis of Mistral."
