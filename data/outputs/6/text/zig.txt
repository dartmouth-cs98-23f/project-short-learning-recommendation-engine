  "introduction": "Music Zig is a high-performance system programming language created by Andrew Kelly in 2016. It is designed as a next-generation alternative to C and is known for its minimalism, extreme speed, and low-level memory control. Zig has a consistent interface for memory management through its standard library allocators, which can be easily swapped out to target different architectures. It also has no hidden memory allocations, making the code more explicit and portable. Zig has no hidden control flow, no operator overloading, and no exceptions. It has a unique comp time keyword that makes it trivial to run code at compile time. Zig integrates well into a C or C++ code base and supports cross-compilation out of the box with LLVM. The language also has a built-in testing framework and a unique defer keyword for automatic memory management. It is designed to be reliable and has a built-in error handling mechanism.",
