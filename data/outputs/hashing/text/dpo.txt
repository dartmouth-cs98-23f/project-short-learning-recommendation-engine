    "highLevelSummary_video": "This video discusses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as a new approach to training language models. DPO is a type of reinforcement learning that effectively moves the probabilities of a language model towards good answers, allowing for better alignment with chat-like models in a more efficient manner than standard training. The video shows the process of using DPO to optimize a language model, and presents two DPO data sets for reference.",
