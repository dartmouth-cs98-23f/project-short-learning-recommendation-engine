"summary": "The video introduces Mistral, a new language model developed by Mistal AI, a European startup in the language models space. It discusses the differences between two models: the 7 billion and the 8 by 7 billion model. The video explores the architectural differences, specifically focusing on the attention mechanism, sliding window attention, kv cache, and feed-forward layer. Additionally, the video provides code examples using the X-Forers library to help illustrate the concepts. It assumes familiarity with the transformer model and the attention mechanism. Key topics covered include: Mistral architecture, Vanilla transformer, sliding window attention, kv cache, and feed-forward layer.",
