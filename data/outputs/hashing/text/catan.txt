that kill your game before it even starts i have seen too many new and beginning players play the game of katon make subtle placement decisions that absolutely eviscerate your chances of winning what were going to do is were going to break down these traps were to go through each one with a little bit of nuance and hopefully by the end of this video you will be placing better and winning more games if youre ready lets get into it get excited cuz i certainly am i want to make a quick statement here before we get into the examples which is that not every trap is necessarily a trap its more important to realize that certain situations have certain nuances and its important for you to read the board use the previous lesson videos we talked about placements and placing out and to be able to make a good read if this is going to be a trap or not as an example well walk through some of these key traps placing next to a starting road this is a very common mistake where a lot of players dont see that a player on the way back and start with a road and then drop a road onto their road and they lose the spot theyre going to so the plow we i think weve all been there weve all seen it how about starting with inflexible to resource setups a lot of players love to go for like a double or sheep theres some issues with that which is that it offers potentially some inflexibility again you have to back all these decisions up with good calculation placing with inflexible ports maybe you have a ton of wood and you dont have a way to use it effectively thats a problem how about building on only one potential road subtle well show some examples of that and the last one which you know you have to make a judgment call but placing on setups that might get over blocked op setups you know that 659 or we cheap probably worth taking in most cases but you have to know the dynamic of the board and know if youre going to get outpaced by the rest of the board so lets get into an example here im super excited i hope you are too why dont we sit down for a second pause the board if you need to do some calculations and i would recommend you place this board out as much as you can see if you can pick first second third fourth all the way through to all eight placements and then when youre done with that unpause the video and well talk about how this game actually occurred hopefully you did that so here you go the first placement on this board was 6510 and the whole idea is they want to go 6510 to 810 why is this a placement trap well theres a few reasons if you look at the makeup of this board the first thing is that 6510 is nice on the surface but youre only going to one subtle spot which is the 810 that would be okay but the issue here in first is its not guaranteed youre going to get the 810 if you look at the wheat on this board the eight is the best wheat so you know it has value with all this ore thats on this board but also the 810 is a fantastic spot potentially for like the five9 10 player so i think if black was just being a little bit more critical about their calculations they would see 6510 is probably losing the 810 in most cases and this makes it a very bad pick so first trap be careful make sure you back up your placement decision with good calculation second picks the 5910 now kind of playing off of what we saw in the previous slide the 5910 obviously can take the 810 but youre going to see that there are some clear problems with this one of the issues i have with the 5910 point left is that its too inflexible pointing left to a brick port makes no sense much better in this situation is the point up now it is true that the 5910 left gives you two settles but frankly youre probably not beating the 1083 at the bottom here to the brick port so effectively you have one settle on the five so much better is if you point up here then you get the road subtle onto the 52 but you also get the 31 which plays much better with the setup than simply playing off the brck port so be very careful about taking inflexible setups in second third takes the 643 here at the top you can see that makes a lot of sense now the question for you is what do you do in fourth i want you to pause the video and place it out take as much time as you need but make sure you do the exercise and come back id be very curious in the comments can you tell me what you picked here for fourth id be very very curious type it in now uh that way you dont see the answer give you a second 5 4 3 2 1 all right so this is what fourth decided to pick the 942 and the 8103 now clearly reds intention here was that they wanted to go for ows they want to go 52 get the pork get the or but whats the issue with this well i think a lot of things are going to be clear when you understand the forcing sequence and i believe th
