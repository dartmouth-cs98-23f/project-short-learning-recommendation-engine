In this episode of the Back Engineering Show, we will discuss the topic of threading and multithreading in the context of networking and connection management, specifically focusing on TCP connection management. We will explore the concept of CPU and I/O bound processes, understanding the nature of backends, and the importance of understanding the specifics of libraries used in processing. We will also discuss the benefits and challenges of multithreading and resource management in modern CPUs with multiple cores. The episode will cover topics such as process and thread management, contention between applications, and the impact of multithreading on performance.
