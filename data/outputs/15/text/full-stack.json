  "introduction": "In this video, we will explore the process of building a job board app, starting with a minimum viable product (MVP) using a single data feed from a job board API. The frontend will be developed in React and Material UI, while the backend will use an Express server and Redis for data storage. The algorithm will filter job listings based on seniority, manager roles, and years of experience. The video covers topics related to web development, software engineering, and data science.",
